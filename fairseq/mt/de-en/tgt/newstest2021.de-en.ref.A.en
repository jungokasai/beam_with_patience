Mamming: Corona mass infection: 174 harvesters infected
After a Corona mass infection on a large vegetable farm in Mamming, Lower Bavaria, almost 500 people have been quarantined and are not allowed anymore to leave the operations.
A security service monitors the curfew.
Altogether 174 harvesters were tested positive for the Corona virus Sars-CoV-2 at a mass screening as the district administration Dingolfing-Landau announced on Saturday evening.
“In order to avoid a further spreading we unfortunately must take this measure to protect the population”, county commissioner Werner Bumeder (CSU) explained.
Before that already seven coworkers had been infected on this farm - this triggered the mass screening.
The operations concern a large vegetable farm that grows strawberries, cucumbers, cabbage and beetroot - however the cucumbers only for canning jars.
Mamming is a rural community with about 3300 residents not far from Dingolfing with its large BMW factory.
Bumeder called on the citizens to keep calm: “According to our information it concerns a closed group of persons.”
On the farm infected coworkers were separated from non-infected ones, the premises are now fenced in with a construction fence.
Greens and SPD blamed the State government for shared responsibility.
Both opposition parties accused prime minister Markus Söder (CSU) and his cabinet to neglect monitoring the housing for seasonal workers.
“That can backfire horribly when such local infections spread and regional lockdowns must be ordered”, said Jürgen Mistol, the parliamentary manager of the Greens.
The SPD shares a similar view: “We have asked for a special control program also for farms with harvesters after the Corona outbreak in the Wiesenhof slaughterhouse mid May”, said the environmental expert Florian von Brunn.
“Especially the hygiene conditions at the work place and the living quarters must - in our view - thoroughly checked.
And that obviously did not happen.”
The outbreak occurred “predictably”.
U-Bahnhof Aidenbachstraße: Dangerous fight: A 19 year-old fell onto the track after being pushed

Obersendling - A fight broke out between two groups of young people at U-Bahnhof Aidenbachstraße at 16:15h on Friday.
A passerby called the police, who called-up multiple squad cars.
Following initial investigations it seems a boy from Munich (17) pushed a 19 year-old to the floor.
This resulted in the young man slipping over the edge of the platform and falling onto the track.
People in the 17 year-old’s party helped the fallen boy climb out of the track bed.
There was no danger of a passing train.
Another scuffle followed between the two persons, according to the police.
The 17 year-old proceeded to flee the crime scene, however, his personal details could be retrieved later.

Assault charges are being pursued against the 17 year-old.
Report: Seehofer pushes for longer telecommunications data retention
Telecommunications data retention is currently suspended.
However, Federal Minister of the Interior Horst Seehofer is pushing for a lengthening of the retention period according to a press report.
He would like to support thereby the fight against child abuse.
According to a media report, Federal Minster of the Interior Horst Seehofer (CSU) is pushing for a longer data retention period: a half-year instead of the current ten weeks.
As reported by the “Bild am Sonntag”, Seehofer asked the Minister of Justice Christine Lambrecht (SPD) in a letter for an express change to the law.
Seehofer wants to strengthen provisions against child abuse thereby.
He thinks that it makes sense “to take up pressing, necessary alterations to the law now,” the newspaper quoted from his release.
Telecommunications data retention is suspended at the moment.
This is waiting on a decision from the EuGH.
However, Seehofer wants the alterations earlier, so that as soon as a likely, positive judgement is handed down, it can be implemented immediately, the letter further stated.
A spokesperson for the Ministry of Justice said to the newspaper, that the need for legal alterations shall first be sensibly reviewed following a decision from the court.
Already in June Seehofer spoke together with the interior ministers of the states in favor of telecommunications data retention in their fight against child abuse and child pornography.
NBA: Strip-club problems for Clippers star Lou Williams
Uproar in the NBA!
Lou Williams (33), basketball pro for the Los Angeles Clippers, seems to have left the tournament district in Disney World (Orlando, Florida) with permission to attend a funeral.
According to US media channels, he then proceeded to visit the “Magic City” strip club in Atlanta that evening.
Williams, who according to ESPN admitted to his visit, is in isolation again and is tested daily for Covid-19.
His reason for the visit: chicken wings.
“Sweet Lou,” as he is called in the NBA, had already expressed his love for just these wings in February of last year.
The American wrote: “Magic City and Blue Flame (editorial note: another strip club in Atlanta ) have the best wings in the city.”
NBA insider Shams Charania let it be known on Sunday on Twitter that the NBA had subjected Williams to a ten-day quarantine.
That is how the Clippers star missed the first two official games after the test-match phase.
The NBA will play out the season in Disney World.
At this moment, the 22 best teams are preparing with training games for the season finals that begin this Friday night.
Söder comments on the Corona situation after mass infection.
Munich - Secretary of Health, Melanie Humi (CSU), already announced on Sunday a testing offensive for large farms.
You can watch live the press conference on our homepage.
The case in Mamming, district Dingolfing-Landau, has alarmed authorities and politicians.
On the large vegetable farm are currently working almost 500 harvesters from several countries; more than one third are infected with the Corona virus.
In the meantime the farm has been quarantined; the farm is blocked off with a construction fence.
Nobody may leave the premises, food is being delivered.
The authorities are offering free of charge Corona tests to the about 3300 locals of the community.
Since the harvesters had little contact with the local residents the district administration assumes so far that infections have not spread beyond the farm.
“The Pain of Remorse”: Confession from the suspected arsonist of Nantes
“My client has shown himself to be very cooperative,” the Lawyer Quentin Chabert told the newspaper.
The defense counsel added: “He regrets his actions very much, the confession was liberating for him.
His client was “plagued with remorse and really taken back by the extent of the damage”.
In the case of a verdict, the man is looking at ten years in prison and a fine of 150,000 euros according to the prosecution.
The gothic Cathedral of St. Peter and St. Paul of Nantes was heavily damaged after a fire last Saturday.
The fire broke out in three places in the church, which were at a considerable distance from one another.
Laboratory investigations corroborated the suspicion of arson.
The detained suspect was already arrested just a few hours after the incident.
However, he was let go after just a day.
The man was a volunteer for the Nantes diocese and was responsible for closing down the cathedral the night of the fire.
Because there was no sign of a violent break-in to the church, he was quickly under the eye of the investigator.
Discussions over abolishing the 50+1 rule
The former DFB president Reinhard Grindel recommended discussions about phasing out the 50+1 rule.
“German Football should at least discuss setting clear rules and requirements for investors before the EU Commission finishes up with all of the details,” Grindel told the “Bild am Sonntag”.
He continued: “The 50+1 rules don’t work at all for the clubs that would most likely be a danger to Dortmund and Bayern: just look at Leipzig and Leverkusen.
In this respect, there is no getting around the debate as to whether to make it easier for clubs, which want to break into this Phalanx, to include investors.”
He has doubts, however, about whether the German Football League is ready to allow majority stakes, which are prevented in the league by the 50+1 rule.
“There is a judicial risk in putting up investment barriers around the Bundesliga’s business locations in the European Single Market,” said Grindel.
The former DFB head sees a danger that “the attempt to secure fairer competition in the Bundesliga would only weaken the competitiveness of our top clubs on the European level, and not lead to more excitement in the championship”.
Even distribution of TV funds would not even produce a decisive result.
“FC Bayern has a revenue of 750 million euros, Borussia Dortmund of 500 million and RB Leipzig a revenue of 300 million.
The difference even between the top three clubs is already immense.
The other 15 clubs have an average budget of about 130 million,” clarified the 58 year-old.
Grindel feels betrayed when looking back at the past.
“Unfortunately, there have been people who have noticed this error and have leaked it to the press instead of bringing it to me directly,” Grindel said referring to the acceptance of an expensive watch, which lead to his resignation in 2019.
“The morality of that has weighed heavy on my mind”.
The 11,000 euro watch was a gift from a Ukrainian official.
“I committed a breach in compliance, and it was right that I reap the consequences of that,” said Grindel.
“I circumvented innocently and with complete transparently with the ominous watch gift.
Many in the DFB knew about this”.
He never “made a secret out of the present,” reassured the 58 year-old.
“One could call it naive but this form of transparency was the exact opposite of corruption.”
“Black Lives Matter”: Many injured and one dead
Protests against police brutality in the United States have picked up again after Donald Trump’s use of federal forces in multiple cities.

Three people were injured in Louisville; in Seattle, 16 people were arrested.
One person died from a gunshot in Austin as a line of protestors were marching over a crossing.
It has come to clashes multiple times during protests against racism and police violence in Portland in the past.
Security forces, including representatives of the federal police, used tear gas on Saturday night and violently pushed demonstrators apart.
Hundreds, at times armed, demonstrators marched on Saturday through Louisville in Kentucky and pressed for those responsible for the death of Breonna Taylor be put to justice.
The 26 year-old student was shot to death in her apartment in Louisville during a drug raid in March.

They were brought to the hospital according to reports from broadcaster NBC.
None of them were in danger of losing their lives.
Police put up barricade after a counter-protest of white militia men also formed.
In the end, it never came to a confrontation between the two groups.
In Austin, Texas someone marching in a “Black Lives Matter” demonstration was shot and killed.
According to their own releases, the police have a suspect in custody.
They have made no further statements concerning the circumstances of the crime.
According to the “New York Times”, Mayor Steve Adler let it be known that like many in the city he was “speechless and inconsolable” about what had happened.
In the American metropolis of Seattle demonstrators also ran into clashes with police on Saturday.
They set construction trailers on fire in front of a youth detention center, the police used stun grenades and pepper spray.
According to the “Seattle Times”, 16 people were taken in for resisting arrested and assault.

A small group of demonstrators broke in windows, lit off fireworks and blinded police with lasers, reported Oakland Police late Saturday evening (local time).
The fire could quickly be put out.
In Aurora, a suburb of Denver in Colorado, a car drove through a crowd of people who were protesting on the highway.
As the police report it, one of the demonstrators fired a weapon and at least one person was injured, brought to the hospital.
Apart from that, the window of a courthouse was also broken in and a fire started, according to police.
Investigations have been taken up.
Rakoczy in Bad Kissingen: Historic costumes in spite of corona
Although the great pub crawl through the Kurstadt didn’t take place, visitors and performers enjoyed the Rakoczy flair of the alternative program.
It was unusual for victors, performers and organizers: The Rakoczy weekend without the Rakoczy festival.
But: Even though the great party mile in the city center was missing, including the crowds and program highlights like the burning of the Saale, the Rakoczy Ball or the parade, many still came in their costumes to the corona-conforming alternative program.
“I think we still succeeded in spreading Rakoczy flair,” said the Kurstadt director, Sylvie Thormann.
The guests seem to have taken it well.
One looks back to the founders of the Rakoczy festival as a matter of principle, because the historic is the focus of the festival.
Pleasant atmosphere
Vesna Konhäuser has been visiting the Rakoczy Festival in Bad Kissingen for more than 25 years.
Even this time during the corona year.
The pair made themselves comfortable at the Luitpold Casino, watched the historic figures as they wandered and heard live Cuban music at the Spielbank Restaurant.
“I find it really pleasant even this way,” said Konhäuser.
She didn’t miss the crowds that are normally a part of Rakoczy.
However, she did miss the rest of the program highlights, most of all the burning of the Saale on Friday evening as well as the historic parade and the concluding fireworks on Sunday evening.
“It is a shame.
The weather this year would have made it perfect,” she said.
The Rakoczy horse show is supposed to take place again
The alternative program meant more work at times for the historic guest performers.
This is true for Christina Gold, who in a normal year helps out with the parade and can be seen there ridding in the carriage of the Kurgarten Café.
This year she was out and about in the city in costume on Saturday and Sunday.
“That was pretty stressful, usually it’s easier for us,” she said.
The riding club had less to do even though individual riders were out in the park.
“We are hopeful that the rider’s quadrille will take place in the coming years,” said Chairwoman Ulrike Waldhofen.
She announced that a Rakoczy riding tournament should also be taking place in 2021 following a multiple year break .
28 corna cases for the Spanish second-league club Fuenlabrada

The bedding has also not been changed for five days.
Food is yet another problem.
It is neither good nor enough, writes “AS”.
The club management on the other hand say they are happy with hotel management.

No one breached corona regulations as laid out by the football association, said the son of the president of the Spanish Primera Division, Javier Tebas, as the news agency Europa Press and the sports newspaper “Marca” reported.
Before departure there had been four infections up to the 19th of July, all of them were isolated and did not travel along.
Right before the flight to A Coruña on Monday, all players and team members were tested again.
As the team arrived in A Coruña, there were “five or six” further team members who had positive results from the corona test.
The game was cancelled 60 minutes before the whistle blow, said Tebas Llanas.

Bike professional Tony Martin: Continuing carrier is possible
The time trial specialist Tony Martin is thinking about continuing his carrier.
Frankfurt/Main - The seven-time time trial specialist Tony Martin can clearly picture continuing his bicycling carrier.
“I am getting the broad strokes of it straight with my team: how and in what form in can continue,” the 35 year-old told the “Frankfurter Allgemeinen Sonntagszeitung.”
Martin is now a member of the Dutch team Jumbo-Visma and he was considering ending his run at the end of this year before the start of the corna virus pandemic.
The number of riding days is the subject being discussed by his team, he said.
Or it’s about other problems bothering him as a father, he continued.
After a fall his first thought used to be: “Hurry get back up on the bicycle.
Now I am thinking as a father of a small daughter: what would happen, if...”
The bicycling professional granted that there were many aspects, which have been hard on him.
“But it was good for me during this corna time to notice how much I have with bicycling and how much fun it was for me”.
The time-travel specialist gets back into a competitive event with the Tour de l’Ain (5th to 9th of August).

Argentina declines creditors’ counteroffer.
The Ministry of Economics in Buenos Aires said on Saturday that the new demands could not be met.
“It would not only be irresponsible but also unjust” one statement read.
“We cannot increase the short-term profit of our creditors while 50 percent of children in Argentina live in poverty”.
The debts of the second-largest economy in South America are no longer sustainable under current conditions.
That is why Argentina is asking its private creditors to forgive a portion of their circa 66 billion US dollar debt (about 59 billion euros).
A government default is looming if no agreement is reached.
It would be the ninth default in Argentina's history.
The creditors recently requested higher interest on government bonds and changes to individual clauses of the contract.
However, the government of Argentina is sticking to its last offer and did not provide further concessions.
Argentina is stuck in a severe financial and economic crises.
The inflation rate was recently more than 50 percent.
Experts are expecting a decline of economic strength of about ten percent in the coming year.
At the end of May, Argentina had not settled interest claims of about 503 million US dollars and thereby slid into a limited default.
Professionally achieved - privately not there yet.
“Everything goes very well” - Dr. Stefanie Kramer concludes after er first days working in the notary’s office in Eggenfelden.
In the end everything went very fast. Middle of May Dr. Stefanie Kramer had learned that she would be the successor of Lutz Feller in the notary’s office in Eggenfelden.
Already six weeks later in the beginning of July the graduated jurist started working, the normal daily work is already in full swing.
“Privately, however, I still have to reach my goals”, says Stefanie in an interview with the Rottaler Anzeiger, and laughs.
Naturally, the short lead time was not enough to transfer the center of her life from Regensburg to Eggenfelden said Stefanie who was born in Dingolfing..
Currently she and her husband who is a judge at the district court in Regensburg were still searching for a suitable apartment or house in the city.
At least, her husband were able to apply on short notice for parental time to be able to take care of their two daughters (3 1/2 and 1 1/2 years old).
In order that she didn’t have to commute from Regensburg every day she found overnight accommodation at her parent’s house in Dingolfing, explained the 39 year old.
Since she grew up in the neighboring county she is quite familiar with the town Eggenfelden.
When she visited the town with her family in the past months she again realized: “Eggenfelden is a really beautiful town.”
Therefore she was so very pleased that she won the job in the selection process for the vacancy.
Her homeland Lower Bavaria plays a central role in Dr. Stefanie Kramer's professional carrier: After her law studies in Passau she completed her traineeship and her 2nd state examination in Regensburg.
After several employments as notary assessor - among others in Rehau and Hof in Upper Franconia, Babenhausen in Lower Allgäu as well as in Regensburg - during this time she also - like ‘in passing’ - completed her doctorate in labor law and then started her first ‘real’ job as notary in Rotthalmünster in the district of Passau in 2012.
In 2016 she applied for parental time which was followed with her move to Regensburg.
Ever since then she accepted substitute services in several notary offices.
When the vacancy in Eggenfelden was advertised due to the approaching retirement of Lutz Feller she anticipated the right time for a professional full re-entry had come, explained the 39 year old.
Dr. Stefanie Kramer adopted the entire team of her predecessor who will become vacation replacement in the notary’s office - and she instantly had only praise for the notary office’s team: “It goes extremely well!”
It makes it easier for her to be able to rely on established routines and thus to have time to taking care of the pending transfer of her private life center point.
Regarding kindergarten respectively nursery places she has already established contact with the local facilities.
And if everything goes as desired she hopes to be able to pursue her hobby again - namely to learn about the most beautiful jogging areas of the Rottal.
BVB is planning to start the league launch with maximum 15,000 spectators.
Dortmund - The Dortmund’s football stadium, the largest in Germany, won’t even fill up to 20 percent capacity as fans return for the start of the season.
“Because of isolation regulations, which must be enforced, we are planning for 12,000 to 15,000 spectators as things stand now,” said Borussia Dortmund’s manager Carsten Cramer to “Tagesspiegel”.
Normally, the arena in the Dortmund has more than 81,000 spectators during Bundesliga games.
Last season’s ghost games, a result of the corona pandemic, caused about 4 million euros in loses per game for the BVB.
Cramer, who is responsible for marketing, digitalization and internationalization for BVB, hopes that the circa 4,000 seats in the hospitality area can be opened up, in addition to the normal spectator seats: “Obviously it is a blow to the business if this income is just completely lost”.
As a result of the ongoing corona crises, everyone is now “well advised to first get into a stable position.”
Cramer explained, “if it is not going well for many companies (about 6.8 million people in Germany alone are on short-time work) then the need for entertainment is limited.”
Dortmund’s head of marketing praised the BVB professionals for having part of their salary waved, which contributes to overcoming the crises: “Of course the players know, that by having part of their salary waved, it causes a much different effect than 100 people in merchandising having to be put on short-time work.”
Small wonders: An early start to life with only a few hundred grams
Hardly heaver then a pack of butter with just three tablespoons of blood in his body: This was Gabriel at birth; he weighed exactly 273 grams.
The lad is just one of 400 early births that are cared for at the Grazer Primary Hospital every year.
A fourth of them weigh less then 1,500 grams, a few are extremely light weight without even a kilogram at birth like Gabriel and his brothers Raphael and Michael.
They are so small and born so early, that neither their lungs, their intestines nor their muscles are fully developed.
Their skin is sometimes so delicate that the electrodes from an ECG can harm it.
They are so small that sometimes they wear puppy clothing and special mini diapers designed just for them.
However, they are not so small that they don’t already have a voice, “and how’s that,” smirked Berndt Urlesberger.
“Even if they don’t scream as loudly as big babies, of course.”
When the whiteboard takes the stage
Despite Corona - theater in the classroom. The whiteboard as stage - shortly before school vacation start this was experienced by 9th graders of the Sankt-Jakobus-Gymnasium in Absagmünd.

Teacher Teresa Nar was happy about the lectures enrichment.
At the end all participants agreed that the direct encounter in a theater and stage room would offer additional appeal but one also saw in the theater the potentials for the contact in schools.
“When we further improve the technical framework this could become an interesting supplement of the ongoing theater operations”, emphasized director Winfried Tobias.

The first round of the DFB-Pokals will take place between the 11th and 14th of September; a week before the start of the third-league.
“Gone with the Wind”: Film legend Olivia de Havilland is dead
The film legend and Oscar winner Olivia de Havilland is dead.
She died of a natural birth on Sunday in Paris at the age of 104, her spokesperson said to the German Press Agency.
She was known for her role as Melanie Hamilton in the southern epic, “Gone with the Wind” (1939).
Born to British parents in Tokyo, Olivia de Havilland moved to California as a small child.
The Austrian theater personality Max Reinhard discovered the 19 year-old in the role of Hermia in Shakespeare’s “A Midsummer Night's Dream”.
Warner Brothers film studio took her immediately under a seven year contract and she made it big alongside Eroll Flynn.
She filmed eight films with the heart breaker.
In 1946 she won her first Oscar as the main role in “To Each His Own”.
The film premiered in Germany under the title “Mutterherz”.
Three years later she got the designation as best actress in William Wylers “The Heiress”.
She received much recognition as a neurotic eccentric in “The Dark Mirror” and “The Snake Pit”.

“Road to Timmendorf“: Beach volleyball: Thole/Wickler miss out on the finale in comeback
The world-champion duo Julius Thole and Clemens Wickler missed out on the beach volleyball tournament “Road to Timmendorf”.
They were defeated by their national team colleagues Nils Ehlers and Lars Flüggen 1:2 (17:21, 21:17, 19:21) in the semi-final during a meet-up of the top teams in Düsseldorf.
Thole/Wickler recently played in the World Tour Final in Rome in September of last year.

Kalbitz expulsion from the AfD is confirmed - FDP calls it ‘fig leaf’.
The expulsion of Andreas Kalbitz from the AfD is - in the FDP’s view - only a ‘fig leaf’ and doesn’t change anything about the party’s character-
“The AfD is the parliamentary arm of the right extremists in Germany.
Andreas Kalbitz is only part of the top of the iceberg of the radicals in the AfD”, said the FDP politician Benjamin Strasser, specialist for domestic affairs, to the news agency dpa in Berlin.
The AfD’s federal arbitration court had confirmed the exclusion of Kalbitz after several hours of hearing on Saturday in Stuttgart; the AfD’s federal board had decided the expulsion with majority in May.
Kalbitz is chairman of the AfD fraction in the Brandenburg state parliament.
“If the AfD is really concerned about removing right wing extremists from its party then officials like Björn Höcke and also his followers would have been expelled a long time ago”, said Strasser.
“For that there is not political will apparent in the AfD because the right wing extremism belongs to the party by now.”
Similar statements come from the CSU secretary general, Markus Blume: “That Andreas Kalbitz now remains expelled does not say anything and changes nothing”, he said to the “Welt am Sonntag”.
“It rather says a lot how many frenetic supporters a right wing extremist still has in the midst of the AfD.”
Blume assumes that the AfD will land again below five percent in future elections.
“AfD’s days in parliaments are numbered.”
Kalbitz was spokesman of the ‘wing’ around the Thuringia AfD state and fraction chairman Björn Höcke that had been dissolve officially by now; the Office for the Protection of the Constitution ranks the movement as ‘severe right wing extremist attempt’.
In May the AfD federal board threw Kalbitz out of the party.
Reason for that was that Kalbitz did not inform the party when applying for membership about his earlier membership in the meanwhile forbidden “Heimattreuen Deutschen Jugend (HDJ) and with the ‘Republikaner’.
Kalbitz denies his membership in the HDJ.
The chairman of the left fraction in the Brandenburg Landtag, Sebastian Walter, also insisted that the decision of the federal arbitration court would not change the character of the AfD. “The wolf only ate chalk.
The AfD remains a right extremist party whether with or without Kalbitz.”
This decision would neither weaken the federal party nor its right wing.
“The maneuvers of the Meuthen troop is transparent.
They want to escape further observations by the Office for the Protection of the Constitution and they try to keep ‘under the radar’”, said Walter.
“The AfD can’t get rid of the ghosts it had called on.
An expulsion does still not anything”, was a comment of the Brandenburg SPD secretary general, Erik Stohn, about the decision in the case Kalbitz.
“The AfD state association and the fraction stood by their right wing leader.”
The legal dispute about Kalbitz’ membership in the AfD will continue.
Kalbitz announced on Saturday he will fight the decision by the federal arbitration court in civil court.
The North Sea wind parks deliver 21+ percent more power.
The wind power plants of the German North Sea delivered 11.51 terawatt hours electricity to the net in the first six months of the year.
That is about 21 percent more compared to the same time period of the last year, informed network operator Tennet in Bayreuth.
Tennet is responsible for the North Sea power transfer and the routing through the German power net.
The wind turbines in the Baltic Sea that do not belong to Tennet’s network delivered another 2.22 terawatt hours (TWh) power.
Altogether, wind generated power from the North and the Baltic Sea generated 13.73 TWH compared to 11.64 TWh in the first half year 2019.
The wind power harvest resembles thus almost 19 percent of the entire wind power in Germany; this is about four percent more than last year.
New wind parks feature higher generation capacities.
The increased contribution of the offshore wind energy results from higher generation capacities beside the wind conditions because new wind parks came into the net within the past twelve months.
If the 1270 wind power plants in the North Sea would all work with full speed they could generate calculated 6.7 gigawatt energy.
The transfer capacity is sufficient for that; according to Tennet it could handle 7.1 gigawatt.
Until 2030 the capacity should increase to 17 gigawatt in the German North Sea.
“Until then we will invest 20 billion Euro in the expansion of the offshore net connections in Germany and the Netherlands”, said Tennet manager Tim Meyerjürgens.
In reality wind parks also at sea cannot exploit their full capacity but reach about 40 percent.
The previous record day in this year was January 2nd when the North Sea wind parks generated more than six gigawatt power.
On average the North Sea wind turbines produce about 2.5 to 3.0 gigawatt energy; that corresponds with three to for nuclear power plants.
With that almost seven million households can be provided with power.
Art “Skirmish” - an exhibition of the Leipzig artist Christian Bold in the gallery of the art association Gmünd.
This was almost a little anniversary celebration of the 130tieth
birthday of the Künstlerverein Gmünd. The exhibition opening “Skirmish” with works by the Leipzig artist Christian Bold exceeded the usual frame after the Corona break.
Many more friends of the arts than usual followed the dialog between the artist and the chairman of the Künstlerverein,Professor Dr. Klaus Ripper.
The musical equivalent was delivered by the band “Defenders of the Universe” at the southern Kornhausplatz.
North of the gallery performed the association “Sandtogether”.
Freital: The Windberg Festival was cancelled because of Corona
The Windberg Festival will not take place this year.
The city of Freital cancelled the planned three-day festival in September.
The city festival has received up to 30,000 visitors in past years.
“We honestly didn’t make this decision lightly - conscious of how financially difficult it will be for those involved - we hoped up to the last moments,” clarified Mayor Uwe Rumberg (Independent).
“But as event organizers we are responsible in the end for the health of thousands of people”.
If tens of thousands of people during the festival had taken to the festival grounds, no minimum distance, hygiene concepts or contact tracing could be maintained as stipulated by current Corona protection ordinances.
Otherwise, the restrictions would have been so extreme that not much of a folk festival would have remained.
Furthermore, the organizational and monitoring expenses would have disproportionately risen by a multitude.
Rumberg is consoled thinking of next year.
That is when the city of Freital will celebrate its centennial with the Winterberg Festival as well as Saxony Day from the 10th to the 12th of September 2021.
Dressur - Olympia champion Werth is not to be defeated in Achleiten

More air traffic controllers in Worms in the future
The University of Applied Sciences in Worms is reaching higher up into the air: The “DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung” is founding a professorship for “Air Traffic Management”.
A corresponding agreement between the college and the DFS was signed in Worms.
The agreement was initially concluded for three years starting in 2021.
For this professorship it is possible to begin studying in winter semester as well as in summer semester.
In that way, twice as many students can be educated as before.
At the same time, the capacity of the college as well as the air traffic control academy of the DFS carry the burden equally.
The DFS will also advise the college in the establishment and appointment of the professorship.
Representing the college since 2019
Since the 2019 summer semester, the first students have been in the Air Traffic Management program at Worms University as part of their training to become air traffic controllers.
Nine students are already starting this year
Up till now, the experience of the DFS has been very positive, the performance of the students has been commendable.
The combination of study and air traffic control training is contributing significantly to the attractiveness of the air traffic control profession.
“In these times, economic support is not easy to come by.
We are counting on air traffic to pick up again and to grow again in the long run.
We need highly qualified personnel in order to be able to fulfill our legal agreement in the future,” said Professor Klaus-Dieter Scheurle, head chairman of the DFS at the signing of the contract.
“The endowed chair is a future-secure investment for the DFS, in order to provide air traffic controllers with a breadth of comprehensive expert base of knowledge in the long run.
We are pursuing a beneficial cooperation with the University and simultaneously underpinning our attractiveness as an employer.”
President of the University of Applied Sciences in Worms Professor Dr. Jens Hermsdorf, also emphasized this: “The endowed chair establishes an important bridge between the economy and science.
With it, we would like to tie together the already existing cooperation with the DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung as our practice partner for the dual bachelor program Air Traffic Management.”
The trust of the Deutsche Flugsicherung for the University in Worms is simultaneously a motivation and a responsibility to further build out their teaching and research competence in the forward-looking field of air traffic.
The applied university with its first endowed chair can set up a dual study program with very special highlights and innovative emphases for its students.
Dr. Denis Alt, State Secretary for the Ministry of Science Education and Culture, emphasized: “The University of Applied Sciences in Worms has a unique selling point in Rhineland-Palatinate in the field of air traffic.
Today’s signing of the cooperation agreement strengthens the profile of the university.”
An emergency rescue helicopter landed on the A 45
The A 45 Autobahn in the direction of Aschaffenburg was fully shut down for 30 minutes on Saturday around noon as an emergency rescue helicopter was deployed following an auto accident.
Around 12:40h a 76 year-old in a Ford drove straight through the curve of the Alzenau-Mitte exit ramp and collided with the crash barrier.
The front air bags were released as a result of the collision, the driver suffered minor injuries to the face and must be brought to a hospital for treatment.
The injuries of the 72 year-old passenger were treated by the emergency medic and the patient was flown to the hospital in the emergency rescue helicopter.
At present the police assume that there is no danger of death.
The damaged vehicle, which suffered circa 2,000 euros in damages, needed to be towed away.
Heil would like to investigate other industries after the meat industry
The corona crises brought conditions in parts of the meat industry to light once again.
A strengthening of the laws is on its way.
Are they legal, and will things remain like that?
The Federal Minister of Labor Hubertus Heil (SPD) wants to investigate other sectors after the currently planned, strict measures against abuses in the meat industry.
“We are going to look at industry after industry and for each respective industry take suitable measures where needed,” Heil said to the German Press Agency in Berlin.
German employers are already warning about limiting work contracts in general.
After the massive corona outbreak at the meat empire Tönnies in North Rhine-Westphalia, the federal cabinet wants to conclude this Wednesday a law from Heil.
Large slaughter houses are no longer able to use external staff for slaughtering, disassembly and meat preparation.
The use of contracted and temporary workers is also forbidden there.
President of employment Ingo Kramer said to the dpa: “Take your finger away from general restrictions on contract labor and personnel leasing if you don’t want to completely stall the economy.”
Service contracts are necessarily a fundamental part of value creation for customers in, for example, large sectors of craftsmanship, construction and plant manufacturing.
“The misconduct of individual actors may not destroy such an important instrument.”
Heil assures: “My goal is not to ban contract workers in general from the German economy”.
Contracts for work make sense.
“When an industrial operation contracts a craftsman to construct a security system that is a very normal contract for work.”
The German meat industry claims that a ban on contracts for work and temporary labor in their sector exclusively would go against the constitution.
It has yet to be made explicit why proportioning and packaging of cheese should have different worker rights in the future then for sausage, claimed a statement on the legislative proposal as reported by the “Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung “ (Saturday).
The user price would rise by 10 to 20 percent per kilo and product as the result of such a ban.
Many Eastern European laborers from contract for work companies work in the branch according to findings from an investigation of NRW worker protection administration, some of them 16 hours a day.
Often there are no pauses.
Pay is reduced for protective equipment and for rent.
It was made clear that the housing situation for the employees was often miserable.
Heil said, that in 2017 a relatively strict law was put into place affecting the meat industry.
It was largely ignored, however, through, “devious designs”.
“Now it really needs to be fundamentally cleaned up”
The politician announced: “In the worker protection law that the cabinet would like to conclude at the end of July, which does not just effect the meat industry, rather, for example, leads to higher examination quota for worker protection and clear criteria for shared accommodation.”
The draft laying before the dpa includes changes to the law to secure employee rights in the meat industry as well as the worker protection law.
Brandenburg’s Consumer Protection Minister Ursula Nonnemacher (Green Party) sees intensive oversight as necessary.
“I would like that we could do even more checks in many areas of regulation: Monitoring of food, animal protection, everything that is possible, for example animal transportation,” said Nonnemacher am Sunday in the RBB program “Brandenburg aktuell”.
More checks are also necessary for staff personnel.
Three dead at crash of ultra-light plane in Germany
According to police at a crash of an ultra-light plane into an multi-family building in Wesel in the German federal state of Nordrhein-Westfalen three people have died.
A child was slightly injured.
Two more people had been rescued injured from the crash site, said a spokesperson from the district control center in Wesel.
A parachute was found at the crash site according to police.
The “Rheinische Post” reported with reference to eye witnesses the plane had collided with a hot-air balloon prior to the crash.
The house was either a one family or two family home.
More details were currently not known.
Clearance of the Opernplatz in Frankfurt was peaceful.
One week after the riots in Frankfurt the clearance of the Opernplatz proceeded also peacefully in the night before Sunday.
Until last, some dozens of people were still present at the place, however, they also left before beginning of the curfew at 1 a.m.
The police was in use with numerous officers since the early evening, a major police detachment was observed in the entire city area.
It was the first time on this weekend that a ban on entering the Opernplatz after midnight had been issued; a week ago riots had occurred at the Opernplatz.
Police had been attacked with bottles by the crowd of rioters.
At least five officers were hurt, according to a police report, police vehicles were damaged.
The night before Saturday remained also quite calm.
Auto rollover: A young woman was severely injured on Federal Highway 83 near Hofgeismar.
A 21 year-old woman suffered serious injury after an accident between Schöneberg and Hümme on Sunday around 13:25h.
She was brought to the clinic in Kassel.
The fire department looked for other possible passengers with thermal imaging cameras.
According to police, the woman was on the Bundesstraße 83 on her way to her home in Hümme as her car deviated from the road for undetermined reasons and rolled over multiple times.
In order to free the unfortunate driver, the fire department had to cut open the roof of the car.
The surrounding cornfield was searched from on top of an aerial ladder with a thermal imagining camera, because it was unclear whether she was driving with anyone else in the vehicle
The drone squad from Warburg, which was also working with thermal imaging cameras, was also ordered for the search.
In any case, emergency personnel didn’t find anyone between the tall corn stalks.
The severely injured driver was brought in an ambulance to the clinic in Kasseler for further care.
Just under 50 emergency personnel from the fire departments of Hofgeismar, Hümme und Schöneberg were on location.
The federal highway was closed for two hours because of the incident.
Juventus Turin Champion in Italy
Turin - After a liberating goal from Cristiano Ronaldo, the record-holding champion Juventus Turin secured itself the Italian championship for the ninth time in a row.
The team with the five-time World Player of the Year now has 36 in total. Scudetto in club history perfect with a 2:0 (1:0) on Sunday night at home against Sampdoria Genoa.
Ronaldo made it 1:0 before halftime.
Turin, which has been playing without the long-injured, former national team player Sami Khedira, is no longer able to be ousted from first place with 83 points and two game days before the end of the series A season.
The second position on the chart is occupied by Inter Milan, who is 7 points behind.
In spite of visual superiority, Juventus was harmless in the first half, then Ronaldo scored with the final move after a free kick.
A pass from Miralem Pjanic lead to the 35 year-old standing right in front of the penalty line with a low shot (45.+7).
Working against guests who were now playing on the offensive, Ronaldo was also able to take part in making it 2:0, Federico Bernardeschi (67.) cleaned up after his shot.
That is how this dull but sure success was secured.
The penalty shot that bounced off of the crossbar in the 89th minute must have only angered Ronaldo himself given his top scorer rank.
“It is hard to remain mentally and physically on the level of the ball for 90 minutes.
Games are strange and can change easily in a moment”, trainer Maurizio Sarri clarified after a 1:2 against Udinese Calcio on Thursday.
The mental exhaustion of his players is substantial on top of everything else, said the Juve coach.
Because of this defeat, Turiner was still not able to secure the championship with a perfect record.
The jump to the top of the charts was in the end particularity attributable to the weakness of the competition.
This is because the Sarri team had only managed five victories in the eleven games leading up to the game on Sunday.
It remains to be seen whether Ronaldo will remain the top scorer.
While the Portuguese superstar has scored 31 goals up till now, Ciro Immobile, who previously played for Dortmund, has 34 goals to his name after his triple score for a 5:1 (1:1) against 4th ranked Lazio Rome at Hellas Verona - as many as Robert Lewandowski contributed to the title win of FC Bayern.
The record in Italy goes to the current Juve professional Gonzalo Higuaín.
The Argentinian player scored 36 goas for SSC Neapel in the 2015/2016 season.
The “Old Lady” of Italian football is waiting till August for their next chance at a title.
Juventus is in the round of 16 of the Champions League and needs to set off a 0:1 first-leg defeat against Olympique Lyonnais on the 7th of August in order to reach the finals tournament in Lissabon.
Real Madrid or Manchester City would then be waiting as an opponent in the next KO round.
Baden-Württemberg: More than 250 illegal car races reported
Stuttgart - Despite impending punishment and court decisions drivers still join numerous illegal races on the roads of Baden-Württemberg. In the past year and the first four month of this year the police in the Southwest has already registered more then 250 illegal car races.
There are no comparative numbers for the previous years but the speeders create increasingly work for the juridical authorities. 155 investigative proceedings due to illegal races were performed at public prosecutors between Konstanz and Mannheim in the year 2018, a year later there were already 252 and in the current year until the beginning of June already 151.
The races were hardly performed as organized events, as it was concluded from a reply of the interior ministry to an inquiry of the Landtag-SPD.
In most cases the drivers would compete with one another spontaneously or they had tried to flee from the police - that is also reported as illegal race.
The cars were driven predominantly by German men in the age between 18 and 60 years old.
113 fines - 15 times imprisonment
Only in comparably a few cases the speeders are caught and then fined accordingly. According to the interior ministry altogether 113 fines and 15 imprisonments were imposed since 2018.
However, there are no real indications that the number of illegal car races does in fact increase.
It is rather a act that other drivers react more sensitive to these races than previously due to some tragic accidents and trials in the past years, and they report them more frequently, said a spokesperson of the ministry.
The speeders love to race especially on the Autobahn 8. Time and again drivers slow down the traffic there to make room and use the free road for a race.
Past August a dozen drivers were caught near Kirchheim unter Teck, three months prior to that even 18 drivers were caught on the A 8 close to Merklingen.
The A 81 is the most favorable “race track”.
The police registers even more races on the A 81 than on any other federal autobahn.
With an imposed speed limit it is attempted to slow down the speeders on the especially frequented section between Engen and Geisingen.
The mostly expensive and tuned-up sports and luxury cars frequently sponsor Swiss license plates because the drivers evade to Germany due to the high penalties for driving too fast and for car races in the neighboring country.
For the SPD speed limits must not be restricted to only a few sections of the roads. “A general speed limit of 130 km/h would do away with this problem on the autobahns”, says Martin Rivoir, the traffic expert of the SPD Landtag fraction.
“The psychological barrier for speeders was significantly higher when one could travel - still legally - here and there at 200 km/h and more”.
Rivoir does not think too much of enlightenment of image campaigns. “Whoever violates all rules in such a way and who risks not only his or her own life but also the life of other road users, he or she can hardly be reached with rationality”.
ADAC demands more drastic police measures
For the ADAC is this, however, not enough: “We assume that speeders are not deterred by speed limits”, says Holger Bach, manager of the department Traffic and Environment at the ADAC Württemberg.
He demands additional and also stricter controlling of the respective road sections.
Quite often the high-speed showdowns end in hurt and serious consequences: Since January 2019 until April 2020 three people died state-wide in races, two of them who were non-participants at a nightly crash in the Stuttgart inner city and one in Gerlingen.
Two young men were said to have had a car race in November.
One of the vehicles strayed from the road, crashed into a garden wall and remained lying on its side, the 18 year old passenger died.
21 other people were injured at races in the past two years.
However, tougher penalties are not necessary according to the secretary of the interior, Thomas Strobl. “We don’t see a legislative need for action to sanction illegal car races even harder”, a paper of the interior ministry states.

Nürnberg: Police intervene in an unauthorized tuning meetup with 700 vehicles and about 1,100 people.
Hundreds of cars and over 1,000 people showed up to a tuning meetup Saturday night in the parking lot of a furniture store.
The police have announced their intention to more strictly regulate such events.
A large tuning meetup took place in a city south of Nürnberg this Saturday evening (25 July, 2020).
Many hundreds of vehicles took part.
According to Mittelfranken Police, an increase presence of vehicles in the area of a large parking lot near a street in Ingolstadt was determined at 22:30h by Nürnberg Police.
That is why the police then carried out multiple vehicle inspections there.
The police have only recently announced their intention to take stronger action against so-called “car posers”.
Illegal tuning meetup in Nürnberg: Only a small portion were from the ‘scene’
Authorities counted a max. of 700 vehicles and about 1100 people, according to police.
Only a small portion of those present were part of the “car poser” or the tuning scene.
Apparently, the larger part of the pertinent scene complied with police appeals.
Judging from the vehicles and persons who were found there, the overwhelming majority were simply curious spectators.
In addition, the overwhelming majority of those present were complying with the relevant infection protection measures, especially by maintaining minimum distance and wearing a face mask.
The control measures that took place there were finished around 1:00h.
In total, the police found 10 vehicles who had the type of structural changes, which would invalidate their operating license.
Four of these vehicles needed to be seized.
No car races
There were no illegal car races.
“The Mittelfranken Police Headquarters will keep the incident in mind, thus leading to further, stronger enforcement measures, even in connection with spectators,” they said.
The News5 agency spoke with Jürgen Schrödinger from the contracting towing company: “They all have beautiful rims, which we are not allowed to scratch,” Schrödinger said.
Special bands were used.
The company needed to pay even closer attention not to cause damage, because the cars themselves are wider.
“Young people should get their cars back unharmed in the end.”
Numbers from the employment agency: 900 cases of suspected abuse of short-term work
Berlin - The Federal Employment Agency (BA) is pursuing about 900 suspected cases of abuse of short-term work.
“Given the 888,000 companies who reported short-term work, that is an extremely small amount,” management board member for operations Daniel Terzenbach told the “Frankfurter Allgemeinen Zeitung”.
When many companies suddenly applied for short-term work at the beginning of the corona crises, the BA needed to react quickly.
Normally the review process lasts up to three week.
“We didn’t have that kind of time available to us in this critical phase.
That is why we will look even more closely at the final accounts.
There will certainly still be more to come.
We are not naive about that and we have endurance”.
The evidence of abuse often came from affected employees and unions.
The BA’s analytics software was then used to detect the patterns of abuse.
The BA is preparing for a likely wave of insolvencies in Autumn, according to Terzenbach.
“Will there be significantly more insolvencies then last year?
The estimates are diverging from one another, but we are arming ourselves for a worst-case scenario and are already training our employees in the employment agency to process applications for insolvency money”.
The numbers are still inconspicuous, said Terzenbach.
World heritage in Potsdam: Party in Neuen Garten dissolved
Potsdam - On Friday night about 40 young people attended a party in the Neuen Garten.
The assembly was dissolved at 20:48 in the evening by the precinct drivers of the foundation Prussian Palaces and Gardens (SPSG), informed the foundation at a PNN information request.
The youths subsequently left the park.
On Saturday evening some young people played Rugby in the Neuen Garten.
The meadow was cleared by the precinct drivers, said SPSG spokesperson Frank Kallensee on Sunday.
Illegal parties happen again and again in the parks.
In the foundation’s parks there are repeated gatherings where the distance and hygiene rules according the Covid-19 directive are not being observed.
At the end of June there was a gathering of about 300 people in the park Babelsberg, a week later about 150 persons had a party in the Neuen Garten.

About 5000 people attended an illegal techno-party in the night before Sunday in the Hasenheide in the district New Cologne.
The gathering was dissolved by the police.

Authorities have reacted to a corona outbreak in the beloved St. Wolfgang tourist destination in Upper Austria.
The number of confirmed cases has risen to 48 according to the regional authorities in Linz.
More then 100 results were still pending in the evening.
Furthermore, many of the infected are young interns in the tourism industry and at least one tourist also tested positive.
Locals, guests and tourism workers are asked to remain in their dwellings Saturday evening.
Curfew was set at 23h.
Bookings “have been cancelled here and there” the head of the Wolfgangsee tourism association Hans Wieser said to the dpa.
Individual guests have also left early.
St. Wolfgang is the most important tourist destination in Upper Austria with more than 400,000 overnight stays last year.
In a normal season, just about a third of the guests are German.
The first infections were made public on Friday.
The head of district authorities, Alois Lanz, defended the behavior of the interns on Saturday, who have vacationed in multiple locals and could have been infected there.
“We all liked to do that in our youth,” he said to the Ö1 radio broadcaster.
In any case, two bars were closed on Friday to prevent further infections.
The tourism association started an informational campaign to increase awareness among younger employees about the dangers of Covid-19.
Hundreds of employees, tourists and locals have been tested since Saturday.
All guests who were in St. Wolfgang since the 15th of July have been contacted.
The breakout brought to mind the ski resort and party local Ishgl in Tirol, which was a center for the spread of Corona in all of Europe during the initial phases.
More then 1,500 people in total are currently infected with the virus in Austria.
Concentrated points of infection are Vienna and Upper Austria.
Premier League: Man United and Chelsea qualified for the champions league
London (dpa) - The English soccer record champion Manchester United returns to the champions league after one year of absence.
The Red Devils secured the third place ranking on the last game day of the premier league through a 2:0 (0:0) victory over the direct competitor Leicester City.
The Foxes must now be content with the European league because they got also passed by the FC Chelsea which qualified also for the king’s class with a fourth place ranking.
Aston Villa could celebrate in the fight against the relegation.
Manchester United took the lead through a penalty kick by Bruno Fernandes (71st minute).
After a red card against Leicester City in extra time Jesse Lingard scored for the final score(90 + 8).
Parallel to it won Chelsea, in the champions league round 16 opponent of the FC Bayern, thanks to Mason Mount (45 + 1) and Oliver Giroud (45 + 4) with 2:0 (2:0) against the Wolverhampton Wanderers.
“That means a lot to me”, said coach Frank Lampard who finds himself also in the final of the FA Cup against Arsenal in his first season as Chelsea coach.
From the Chelsea victory over Wolverhampton benefitted the Tottenham Hotspurs which passed the Wolves with a meager 1:1 (1:0) at Crystal Palace and which starts in the Europe League with a sixth place ranking.
Aston Villa won the long-distance duel against the FC Watford and the AGC Bournemouth but had to fear for its stay in the class for a long time at West Ham United.
The late lead by Jack Grealish (84th) was equalized promptly by Jarmolenko (85th).
However, the 1:1 (0:0) was enough because Watford lost with 2:3 (1:3) at Arsenal.
The club which fired three coaches during the season descends to a lower class after five premier league years.
Exactly like Bournemouth that could save itself even with a 3:1 (2:1) at the FC Everton.
At the end one point was missing.
The FC Liverpool which had secured the English championship already since the end of June also achieved a club record with a 3:1 (1:1) victory at Newcastle United.
99 points are the highest score that the Reds ever achieved in a soccer season.
Coach Jürgen Klopp with his team only narrowly missed the points record in English soccer.
The record is held by Manchester City with 100 points in the season 2017/18.
After the Newcastle lead in the first minute Virgil van Dijk (38th), Divock Origi (59th) and Sadio Mané (89th) turned the match in favor of Liverpool.
“For this great club it was an extraordinary season”, said scorer van Dijk after the game, “that should motivate us to defend the title.
It will be difficult”.
The premier league bosses could also be content at the end.
Soccer schedules and operations in England were interrupted from March 13 to June 17 due to the Corona virus crisis.
In the meantime one discussed even a premature cancellation or a holding of the remaining games on neutral grounds.
Finally, the season could however be completed without special occurrences - but like in Germany without spectators in the stadiums.
Arrests and violence at demonstrations against Netanjahu.
The protests in Israel against head of government Netanjahu become more frequent.
Violent confrontations occurred last night.
The Israeli police acted forcibly against participants of a demonstration against the right-conservative head of government Benjamin Netanjahu during the night before Sunday.
Twelve people had been arrested due to participation in unrest, informed police spokesperson Micky Rosenfeld.
Among others the police used water guns to dissolve the rally.
According to media reports altogether around 6000 people had come together near Netanjahu’s official residence on Saturday evening.
They protested against unemployment, corruption and Netanjahu’s handling of the Corona crisis.
The protesters beat drums, used trumpets and demanded Netanjahu’s resignation.
As the news site “ynet” reported participants of a counter demonstration which supported Netanjahu were also arrested.
In many other locations in Israel people demonstrated, among others, in front of the private villa of the head of government in the coastal town Caesarea and in a park in Tel Aviv.
According to police a man was arrested near Tel Aviv since he is suspected to have sprayed pepper spray from a moving car on demonstrators at the roadside.
Another man was arrested in the south of the country after a knife attack on a demonstrator.
The demonstrator was slightly hurt in the neck area.
Previously there were several demonstrations against Netanjahu in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv.
The rallies accompany the corruption trial against the head of government.
Finally, Netanjahu was also criticized for his handling of the Corona crisis.
He is accused, among others, for hasty easing of lockdowns and an insufficient preparation of a second Corona wave.
The Corona crisis has significantly hurt the country’s economy.
Lately, the unemployment rate was at 20 percent.
The number of new infections with the Corona virus in Israel increased most recently to always new record figures.
Accident in Ahlen (NRW ) - A van runs into a car - nine are injured - Ruhr Valley - bild.de
Ahlen - A traffic accident lead to nine lightly wounded people on Saturday afternoon on the B58 in Ahlen.
A driver was traveling with her two children (3,5) in the direction of Beckum.
Police: “Apparently she suddenly braked because she wanted to turn.”
A driver of a Mercedes van, who was driving behind her, seems to have noticed too late.
He crashed into the back of the car.
Following the accident, three passengers in the car and six passengers in the van were lightly injured.
Multiple rescue vehicles brought them to a nearby hospital.
North Korea isolated a border town after Corona suspected case.
Up to now North Korea saw “brilliant success” in its own measures defending against the Corona virus.
Now the country reports for the first time about a suspected case.
Because of a first official Corona suspected case in the country North Korea cordoned off an entire major city fearing a catastrophe.
Despite strict epidemiological defensive measures in the past six months “the evil virus could have been brought in into the country”, reported the state media.
The state of emergency was declared for the region around the border town Kaesong.
The Communist leadership raised the highest alert level.
If the suspected case is confirmed it would be the first official case of infection with Sars-CoV-2 in the sealed off country.
Up to now and according to its own indication North Korea had not registered a single infection and described its defensive measures a “splendid success”.
This information was doubted overseas.
According to reports the symptoms were detected in a ‘runaway’ who had crossed the military demarcation line between South and North Korea on July 19.
The person had defected to South Korea three years ago and had now returned across the borders.
So far there was no confirmation from South Korea about the border crossing within the four kilometer wide and largely still mined military buffer zone.
However, according to reports by the national news agency Yonhap South Korea’s military admitted the possibility of an illegal border crossing to North Korea were rather high.
Some people would be investigated in that regard.
According to own reports North Korea summoned an emergency meeting of the politburo of the Labor Party chaired by ruler Kim Jong Un.
The “perilous situation in Kaesong could trigger a deadly and destructive catastrophe”.
It is further reported that Kim had ordered already on Friday - as preventive measure - “to block Kaesong completely and isolate every district and the entire region from others”.
The respective person as well as all other people in Kaesong who were in contact this person had been quarantined.
The party’s military committee should thus investigate the ‘runaway case’ as well as the behavior of the responsible military unit and, if need be, apply severe punishment.
About 300000 people live in Kaesong according to estimates.
Tensions before the council meeting: City-East and noise protection are still up for debate before the long summer break.
“Beside environmental concerns the members of the board must vote - among others - on the development plan for the major project Inner City Development-East”, it states rather casually in the midsection of the city’s press release referring to the next local council meeting on Tuesday, July 28, at 16:30 in the large hall of the Congress Center in Pforzheim.
Especially the appreciation of the Eastern part of the city will be controversy discussed till the end.
The majority for that is tight, most recently even dismissive in the various committees depending on the members present.
An appeal from the economy (construction, real estate, trade and IT) to not let the project fail now after almost ten years of preparation, a project that came straight from the citizens and that was developed by administration and local council; this appeal was criticized by project opponent Reinhard Klein as “extra-parliamentary opposition”, “clueless”, “speculation”, slander” and “conscious false statements”.
“They all think they know better”, so Klein who is a member of the local council for one year as the lone representative of the Citizen’s List Pforzheim.
In fact, he would be in this position after he had read the contracts: “I know what I am talking about”.
The withdrawal would be cheaper for the city, the Technical City Hall could be renovated for 8.5 million Euro contrary to statements from the city administration, namely after grants, which are real in my view.
The city would develop in totally different ways, different from what they forecast in city hall and from what is said by economics.
The city must grow through its own strength and not through investors. That would be his plan B. One day after Klein the FDP/FW/UB/LED fraction, which also dismisses the project, presented an alternative concept.
It stipulates essentially also the renovation of the Technical City Hall, the keeping open of the Schlossberg, the leasing of the Ex-Thales for administrative areas and a small-scale redesign of the inner city ideally with local public sponsors.
Environmental concerns play a central role.
Beside that environmental concerns will in particular play a central role.
Therefore, the local council will, among others, vote on a noise protection action plan.
This plan contains diverse measures to protect the population of Pforzheim from health related noise pollution caused by road traffic - some of the measures are speed reductions.
In a press release the local automobile club Germany welcomed the introduction to a speed limit of 30 km/h. The politicians responsible in the city are not free of blame that it had to come to that because they neglected the public bus service with reduced cycle times and because they showed little interest in building up bicycle lanes - all that lead to a massive increase of the car traffic and thus contributed to the increased noise, stated the VCD.
The local council will also vote on the city’s participation in the energy and climate protection agency Pforzheim/Entkreis.
Also on the agenda is the accession to the environment protection pact of the State Baden-Württemberg, the new adjustment of parental contributions to the city’s children day care centers and the application for entry in the Federal smart-city-support program.
Citizens are welcome but must comply with Corona protection measures.
Tim Zimmermann starts into the season with a great delay
Tim Zimmermann starts in his premier season in the ADAC GT Masters on July 31 with a delay of almost half a year.
Before the league of super sports cars can start regular operations the first test drives were scheduled.
For Zimmermann it was first of all about getting to know his Lamborghini Huracan GT3 much closer.
The Corona crisis prevented for a long time that Tim Zimmermann could tackle his first official test drive in his new Lamborghini Huracan from Grasser Racing.
This was possible now under special hygiene conditions.
The 23 year old from Langenargen spun his first rounds at the Lausitzring and could get a feel for his premiere in the GT3 car.
“There are indeed a few things that differ from the Porsche of the previous season”, says Zimmermann.
“With the ABS one must for example take curves quite differently.
But I had really great fun with it”.
Zimmermann had also fun with Steijn Schothorst with whom he will share his orange sports car in the GT Masters.
The man from the Netherlands is quite experienced in the GT sport despite his young age of 25 years and he could help his new teammate with many things.
“I am not at all a beginner in motor sports but each new series brings along new challenges”, says Zimmermann.
“Steijn and I understand one another splendidly and at the Lausitzring we enormously progresses from season to season”.
Exactly there - at the Lausitzring - the GT Masters will also complete its first race.
From July 31 on the 33 super sports cars will race through the Lausitz.
Zimmerman who is one of the 15 series newcomers does, however, know the race track.
Last time in 2015 he was guest in the motodrom.
“It worked very fast and I had little problems adjusting to the track”, says Zimmermann who starts for the Friedrichshafen race collective Graf Zeppelin.
“The Lausitzring has many fast passages that you must meet perfectly in order to be fast”.
How really fast Zimmermann will be that remains to be seen in two weeks.
“All teams play poker a bit when testing”, he says.
“In conclusion we are very satisfied and we are looking forward to the first weekend at the Lausitzring”.
The race in Brandenburg will be the start of a very busy schedule.
Until the beginning of November seven races are planned.
Current status is that no spectators will be allowed - but there will be a prominent guest.
Mid August at the Nürburgring ex-Formula-1-pilot Niko Hülkenberg will also grab a GT steering wheel.
British secretary of traffic caught off guard by quarantine decision
The decision of the British government to quarantine Spain vacationers after their return for two weeks had caught the country’s secretary of traffic off guard, according to press reports.
According to that, Grant Shapps is currently on vacation of all things in Spain while his colleagues at home decided the measure on Saturday.
Because of the re-increasing numbers of Corona infections the cabinet in London removed Spain from the list of those countries from where an entry was possible without quarantine restrictions.
The new ruling is valid from today, Sunday, and thus Shapps has to be also quarantined after his return.
The Austrian government decided also on quarantine measures for returnees.
But their ruling applies to those who are only just on the effective day on vacation, only from Saturday August 1 on, and it was not introduced over night.
By the way, up to now Spain is considered in Austria as one of the “secure countries” for which no quarantine is necessary in Austria.
“Numerous secretaries probably knew in advance that there is a possibility that a quarantine is issued for Spain vacationers”, commented the Labor representative Diane Abbot.
“However, nobody took the trouble to inform Grant Shapps about it”.
Just one month after the end of the Corona state of emergency in Spain and the expiration of the strict curfew the infection numbers in the country are increasing again.
Virologists make the nightlife responsible for the anew spreading.
Spain is one of Britain’s most favorable country.
Currently, the British government discourages from unnecessary travels to the Spanish mainland, except for the Canary and Balearic Islands which are especially favored by British vacationers.
So far 272.000 infections with the new Corona virus and more than 28000 deaths have been reported in Spain.

According to reports from the Johns-Hopkins-University, so far 5000 people have died in Texas alone due to the Corona epidemic.
Abbott told the people who had to leave their homes to be careful.

US President Trump wrote on Twitter that his government observed the storms very closely and would be in contact with the respective federal states.
Four goals were annulled: Video assistant “punishes” Sassuolo
Sassuolo’s Filip Djuricic was even denied two goals.

FC Bayern Munich: Pavard injured
Munich (dpa) - The start in the hot preparation phase for the Champions League began for double winner FC Bayern with a setback.
Hansi Flick, “somewhat well” recovered after a short vacation and a few days of training must - after the first team training - already think about how he can restructure his successful defense after the injury of world champion Benjamin Pavard.
The Frenchman, who featured the third most minutes of use behind captain Manuel Neuer and midfielder Joshua Kimmich, suffered a ligament injury on the left tarsal and will possibly miss decisive duels in the king’s class.
The right-back aborted a practice game in the Munich foul weather and left the field on a golf cart.
For how long the unlimited regular player must pause in the fight about titles remains open.
His use in the second round return match against the FC Chelsea on August 8 is hardly possible, the 24 year old player may hope for his use in the final tournament in Lisbon beginning on August 12.
However, the Bayern let this misfortune from the practice field on Sunday stop them.
Flick named the three attributes in his personal triple formula that he expects from his stars on the way to the Portuguese capital.
Quality, intensity and concentration his hungry for victory title collectors ought to display ideally in the subsequent 28 days until the final game of the king’s class on August 23.
“We have simply brilliantly mastered the obligatory tasks with championship and cup final.
Now it is time to still achieve the very special”, said Flick.
However, before the Munich team can focus on the final tournament, and prior to that a training camp on the Algarve, the round of sixteen obligation against the FC Chelsea is lined up.
After the 3:0 victory in the first leg game before the Corona break the London club should not become another Bayern nightmare again such as in the lost “Final at home” in 2012.
“First, we have to go through the door.
We want to win, create good conditions and fuel our confidence with a good game”, demanded Flick.
A test for fine-tuning is lined up against Olympique Marseille on Friday.
Flick had sworn his stars with a long speech to an unique August after the team had a 13 day vacation after winning the double.
He greeted 31 players at the Säbener Straße, among them the new players around special purchase Leroy Sané who met all new colleagues on the field for the first time after his transfer from Manchester City.
“Leroy, like all the other new ones, has fir in very well”, reported Flick.
But instead to talk about the new season when Sané & co. are not only participants in diverse practice units Flick prefers to talk about the current title project of the German serial champion.
After day of individual and small group practices one trains now as a team for the game against Chelsea which is in game rhythm contrary to the Flick ensemble.
After that the FC Bayern may face a quarterfinal against the FC Barcelona and Lionel Messi, in the semi-final Real Madrid, Manchester City or Juventus Turin are possible opponents.
A way to the final in Lisbon “is not that easy”, emphasized the head coach who can rely on the practice services of his new assistant Miroslav Klose, starting on Tuesday.
The world champion record scorer Klose and Flick know about some common tournament preparation where the 0-to-100 percent atonement is so decisive.
Working with his current team would be a “pleasure”, praised Flick.
“Focusing on winning” is an impressive characteristic of his team.
At the tournament with teams of nine it really got down to business on Sunday.
All top performers were present even the transfer-willing Thiago and full-back David Alaba whose remaining in the team is uncertain beyond the king’s class season.
The Formula 1 needs a special rule to elect its world champion.
Since the races cannot be driven on the requested number of continents the FIA must improvise when awarding the world championship title.
All America races had been cancelled.
The race schedule becomes more concrete.
The race schedule of the current Formula 1 season becomes clearer.
During the week three more race tracks have been added to the so far ten confirmed Grand Prix races.
In October one tends to also drive at the Nürburgring in Germany and in the Portuguese Portimao.
On November first Lewis Hamilton and Co. will fight for world championship points at the Italian traditional racetrack in Imola.
With that the race schedule for 2020 comprises 13 races according to the current information.
“We are happy that we further progress very much when finishing our plans for the season 2020”, said Formula 1 boss Chase Carey.
In this extraordinary season altogether 15 to 18 races were to be completed in the premium class of motor sport.
The Formula 1 wants to finish its season in Asia.
The finalized race schedule should be fixated and published in the coming weeks.
According to media reports, races could happen in Vietnam and Malaysia by the end of November even before the officially planned races in Bahrein and Abu Dhabi.
The regulations demand races on three continents.

Even when, as currently planned, races will be happening on only two continents there will be a world champion.
With the help of a special rule the FIA wants to award the title calling on “extraordinary circumstances” due to the Corona virus epidemic.
The traditional season start in Australia in March had been cancelled on short notice due to the impending Corona crisis.
A return to this continent still in this year is out of question.
Furthermore, the Formula 1 will not be guest in Marica in this year.
Cancellation finds criticism in Brazil.
The races in Canada, the USA, Mexico, and Brazil are cancelled due to the tightened Corona situation.
“We are happy to be with you again in the upcoming season”, explained Carey.
The cancellation of the America races was especially criticized in Brazil. “The cancellation did not come as a surprise for us but we cannot accept the reasons for it”, opined Tamas Rohonyi, promoter of the grand prix in Sao Paulo.
The infection numbers in the Sao Paulo region would be significant lower than in other regions of Brazil.
The concern of some teams not wanting to drive in Brazil would not justify a cancellation.
One would be prepared for the requested security measures.
Greta Thunberg: Evil eye against Donald Trump went around the world.
Greta Thunberg talked about her encounter with the US President Donald Trump.
Greta Thunberg was a guest via video in the well-known late-night show with Stephen Colbert and in her interview she shared what she was thinking when she encountered Donald Trump.
Climate activist Greta Thunberg was a guest via video connection in a popular US late-night show.
Among others, she recalled her fight against the mightiest of the world.
The teenager also talked about her famous “evil eye” when she encountered Donald Trump.
New York City - In the past two years the climate activist Greta Thunberg drew attention with her tireless commitment for the “Fridays For Future” movement.
Now she talked with a well-known late-night show about her plans for the future as well as her encounter with the then US President Donald Trump at the UN summit in the past year.
Late-night moderator Stephen Colbert welcomed the 17 year old Thunberg in his program on Tuesday and had a lengthy interview with the Swede.
In the interview she not only talked about her fight against climate changes but also her conflict with the powerful ones of the world.
“There are things that surprised me”, she said.
“How far people will go to distract from the climate crisis”, that had her baffled.
“Everything from organized hate campaigns up to threats only because a group of children turn to protests”, she said she experienced.
Head of states and leading politicians that make fun of them in social media or even try to silence them she finds “funny” since their reactions show her “that they have no other answer to it”.
Especially interesting it became at the end of the interview when Greta Thunberg was asked about a famous scene in which she had given Donald Trump the “evil eye”.
At the UN summit 2019 in New York for which the activist had sailed across the Atlantic Ocean her expressive glance was caught by the cameras and was viewed by innumerable people in the Internet since then.
A GIF, an animated picture originated from the short clip that finally became one of the most frequently used images for Trump opponents.
However, what had the 17 year old thought about the US President at that moment?
To the relatively open question by Stephen Colbert she answered short and dry: “To be honest I think that needs no further explanation”.
It seems, the experienced satirist Stephen Colbert didn’t expect this quick-witted answer and he disappeared for a moment out of sight, laughing.
With her “How dare you” speech about the principles of climate protection she will be remembered by many at the climate conference.
Ex-Dortmunder Immobile with three-pack for Lazio Rome
Ciro Immobile is in the running for Europe’s Golden Shoe now in the same position as Bavaria’s Robert Lewandowski.

The former BVB professional contributed three goals during the 5:1 (1:1) victory over Lazio Rome in Hellas Verona, two of which were penalty kicks in the extra time of both halves.
In so doing, the 30 year-old from the 4th ranked team now has 34 season goals in the bank two games before the end of the season - that’s just as many as Robert Lewandowski from FC Bayern Munich had in the last Bundesliga season.
Cristiano Ronaldo in Italy is following behind with 30 goals so far, the Portuguese superstar still meet with the leader on the evening at Sampdoria Genua.
Fleetwood Mac co-founder Peter Green has died
His life was a roller coaster ride: Following a lighting-fast assent with Fleetwood Mac, he went into a steep fall and then came slowly back up again.
Now the blues rock guitarist Peter Green has died at the age of 73.
Great guitarist, drug addict, cult member: The co-founder of Fleetwood Mac, Peter Green, is dead.
He died peacefully in his sleep at the age of 73, family members reported on Saturday in an official statement, a further statement was announced for the upcoming days.
Top musicians such as Peter Frampton consider Green to be one of the best blues and rock guitarists.
In an emotional reaction, Mick Fleetwood spoke of a “monumental loss“ for all previous and current members of the band Fleetwood Mac.
The drummer Fleetwood and the guitarist Green founded the now legendary band in London in 1967, his dreamy instrumental hit “Albatross” remains unforgettable up into the current day.
The life of the musician (“The End Of The Game”, “In The Skies”) was like a roller coaster ride.
Green experienced a lighting-fast rise as part of Fleetwood Mac, however, the band celebrated their greatest successes without him.
Among other factors, there were fights because Green wanted to donate the profits of the group to good causes.
He started to appear in wide robes and with a giant crucifix.
Mental-health issues also seemed to have played a role.
Green left in 1970 just three years after founding the band.
A social descent followed.
The blues rock guitarist suffered from drug abuse and schizophrenia, as biographers report.
Green was treated in the psychiatric ward for a long time.
The musician disappeared from the scene for a large part of the 1970s.
He supposedly lived on the street for a time, worked as a cemetery gardener and spent sometime in an Israeli kibbutz.
Green was born in 1946 as the son of a Jewish working-class family in the London borough of Bethnal.
In his younger years he was already excited about US blues musicians like B.B. King and Muddy Waters.
He learned his first guitar chords at eleven.
At 15 the teenager started to play professional guitar and got the chance five years later to stand on stage as the lead guitarist for the instrumental group Peter B’s Looners.
A little later he was working as the stand-in for his idol Eric Clapton with the Bluesbreakers.
In the middle of the Blues Boom, Green founded Fleetwood Mac in the summer of 1967 together with his Bluesbreakers colleagues Mick Fleetwood and John McVie.
“Albatross”, a song composed by Green, ensured the group their first No.1 hit in the winter of 1968/1969 and catapulted them to the top of the British music scene.
The quick accent showed its dark side quickly: Green did not deal with the media circus well and his experiments with the drug LSD got progressively more extreme.
He commented later in an interview about his life between music and addiction: “The worst that happened to me in life was the drugs, the best was to land the no.1 hit”.
At the end of the decade, Green managed a surprising, respectable achievement in 1979 with an album inspired by religious themes.
Fleetwood Mac in the meantime floated on a wave of success in a new formation without him.
The 1977 album “Rumours“ sold more than 40 million copies worldwide.
In spite of small solo successes, Green never managed a great comeback, until he started anew in 1996 with a group of musician friends.
The British “Daily Telegraph” spoke at the time from a rockstar come back from the grave.
Green released a few albums with the Peter Green Splinter Group before the band broke up in 2004.
He was already a blues legend for music experts during his lifetime, and an influential guitarist of past decades with his gentle sounds.
