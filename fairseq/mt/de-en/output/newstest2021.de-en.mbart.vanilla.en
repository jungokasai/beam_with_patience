Biker reacts lightning fast and prevents worse
On Friday evening, a traffic accident occurred on the country road between Machtolsheim and Merklingen, in which a motorcyclist was only slightly injured thanks to his quick reaction.
Motorist overlooks biker
A 44-year-old driver wanted to turn left onto Landesstraße 1230 towards Machtolsheim with her VW coming from Merklingen at around 9.30 p.m.
She overlooked the 24-year-old motorcyclist coming from Nellingen.
In the event of a collision, hand and foot brake levers fly away
The biker tried to avoid the car, but still hit it at the rear of the vehicle.
The hand and foot brake levers on the Suzuki were removed and the driver was no longer able to brake.
Mindful, he steered his motorcycle into the green strips next to the road and let it roll out without falling.
Biker suffers leg injury
Due to the collision with the car, the biker nevertheless suffered an injury to the Beim and had to be treated in a clinic.
Mamming: Corona mass infection: 174 harvester infected
After a corona mass infection on a large vegetable farm in Mamming, Lower Bavaria, nearly 500 people are under quarantine and are no longer allowed to leave the farm.
A security service monitors the ban.
A total of 174 harvest helpers were tested positive for the Corona pathogen Sars-CoV-2 during the series test, as the Landratsamt Dingolfing-Landau reported on Saturday evening.
"Unfortunately, in order to avoid further spread, we must take this step to protect the population," stated Werner Bumeder (CSU).
Previously, seven employees had been infected in the plant - this was the reason for the series test.
The farm is a large vegetable garden that grows strawberries, cucumbers, cabbage and red beet - but the cucumbers are only for jars.
Mamming is a rural municipality with 3300 inhabitants not far from Dingolfing with its large BMW factory.
Bumeder appealed to the citizens to remain calm: "According to our information, this is a closed circle of people".
On the farm, infected workers were separated from uninfected employees, and the site is now surrounded by a barrier fence.
Greens and SPD gave the state government co-responsibility.
The two opposition parties accused Prime Minister Markus Söder (CSU) and his cabinet of neglecting to control the accommodation of seasonal workers.
"This can take a bitter revenge if such local infections occur and regional lockdowns have to be ordered," said Jürgen Mistol, the parliamentary managing director of the Greens.
The SPD sees this quite similarly: "After the Corona outbreak in the Wiesenhof slaughterhouse in mid-May, we already demanded a special control programme for farms with harvest workers," said environmental expert Florian von Brunn.
"From our point of view, it is particularly the hygiene conditions at the workplace and living conditions that need to be strictly controlled.
Obviously this has not happened."
The outbreak had come "with announcement".
Aidenbachstraße Underground Station: Dangerous quarrel: 19-year-old falls into the rail bed after Schubser
During a fight between two youth groups at the Aidenbachstraße underground station, a 19-year-old fell down by a pusher and slipped into the trackbed.
Obersendling - On Friday there was a dispute between two youth groups at the subway station Aidenbachstraße at 16:15.
A passer-by alerted the police, who approached with several stripes.
According to the first investigation, a Munich man (17) pushed a 19-year-old to the ground.
The young man slipped over the edge of the platform and fell into the track bed.
Persons from the 17-year-old's group helped him climb out of the track.
There was no danger from an incoming train.
According to the police, there were subsequent clashes between the two people.
The 17-year-old initially fled the scene, but his identities could be determined afterwards.
Accompanied by his father, he went to the police inspection 29.
The 17-year-old is being investigated for assault.
Report: Seehofer pushes for longer data retention
Data retention is currently suspended.
According to a media report, however, Federal Minister of the Interior Horst Seehofer is calling for an extension of the storage period.
He wants to strengthen the fight against child abuse.
According to a media report, Federal Minister of the Interior Horst Seehofer (CSU) is calling for an extended data retention period - half a year instead of the planned ten weeks.
As the "Bild am Sonntag" reports, Seehofer Justice Minister Christine Lambrecht (SPD) asked in a letter for a swift amendment of the law.
Seehofer therefore wants to strengthen the measures against child abuse.
He believes it makes sense to "make urgently needed adjustments to the law already now," the newspaper quotes from the letter.
Data storage is currently suspended.
A decision of the European Court of Justice is expected.
Seehofer, however, wants the changes to be made beforehand so that they can be applied immediately after a possible positive verdict, the report continues.
A spokesman for the Ministry of Justice told the newspaper that it would only be useful to examine whether there was a need for legal changes once the courts had ruled.
In the fight against child abuse and child pornography, Seehofer, together with the interior ministers of the countries, had already spoken out in June in favour of data retention.
NBA: Strip club announcer for Clippers star Lou Williams
Excitement in the NBA!
Lou Williams (33), basketball professional of the Los Angeles Clippers, is said to have left the tournament quarter in Disney World in Orlando/Florida with permission for a funeral.
According to U.S. media reports, however, he still visited the strip club "Magic City" in Atlanta in the evening.
Williams, who is said to have admitted the visit according to ESPN, is back in Isloation, being tested daily on Covid-19.
His reason for visiting: Chicken Wings.
In February last year, "Sweet Lou", as he is called in the NBA, already expressed his love for precisely these wings.
The American wrote: "Magic City and Blue Flame (another strip club in Atlanta, by the way) have the best wings in town."
NBA insider Shams Charania announced on Twitter on Sunday that the NBA Williams has ordered a ten-day quarantine.
The Clippers star missed the first two official games after the test phase.
In Disney World, the NBA wants to end the Corona season.
Currently, the top 22 teams are preparing for the season finale, which starts on Friday night.
Söder expresses his opinion on the corona location after mass infection
Munich - Health Minister Melanie Huml (CSU) has already announced on Sunday a Testoffensive for large farms.
The press conference will be shown live on our homepage.
The case in Mamming in the district of Dingolfing-Landau has alarmed authorities and politicians.
Almost 500 harvesters from several countries are currently working on the large vegetable farm, and over a third have become infected with the Corona pathogen.
The farm is now under quarantine and is fenced off with a fence.
No one is allowed to leave the premises, food is delivered.
The authorities are now offering Corona tests free of charge to the more than 3300 residents of the municipality.
Since the harvesters had little contact with the local population, the Landratsamt assumes that the infections did not spread beyond the farm.
"Bits of Conscience": Confession of the alleged arsonist of Nantes
"My client has shown cooperation," lawyer Quentin Chabert told the newspaper.
The defender added, "He regrets the deeds very much, the confession was a liberation for him."
His mandate was " plagued by pangs of conscience and greatly affected by the extent of the destruction".
In the event of a conviction, according to the prosecutor's office, the man faces ten years in prison and a fine of 150,000 euros.
The Gothic St. Peter and Paul Cathedral in Nantes was badly damaged by a fire on the night of Saturday last week.
The fire broke out in three far-off places in the church.
Laboratory tests confirmed the suspicion of arson.
The suspect, now in custody, had already been arrested a few hours after the fire.
He was released a day later.
The man works as a volunteer for the diocese of Nantes and was responsible for closing the cathedral on the eve of the fire.
Since there was no sign of a violent invasion of the church, he quickly came into the spotlight of the investigators.
Discuss the abolition of the 50+1 rule
Former DFB President Reinhard Grindel has recommended thinking about abolishing the 50+1 rule.
"German football should at least discuss, lay down conditions and clear rules for investors before the EU Commission creates complete facts," said Grindel of Bild am Sonntag.
He emphasized: "The 50+1 rules do not work anyway for the clubs that can become the most dangerous for Bayern and Dortmund: see Leipzig or Leverkusen.
In this respect, the debate cannot be avoided as to whether it is not advisable to facilitate the involvement of investors in associations that want to break into this phalanx."
However, he has doubts whether there is a willingness in the German Football League to allow majority ownership, which is prohibited in the Bundesliga by the 50+1 rule.
"It remains a legal risk to pull investment fences around the business location Bundesliga in a European internal market," Grindel said.
The former DFB-Chef sees the danger that "attempts to ensure a more competitive balance in the Bundesliga will ultimately only weaken the competitiveness of our top clubs at European level, but will not lead to more tension in the championship".
Even an equal distribution of TV funds will not have a decisive effect.
"FC Bayern makes a turnover of 750 million euros, Borussia Dortmund of 500 million and RB Leipzig of 300 million.
The differences are thus already immense among the first three clubs alone.
The other 15 clubs have an average budget of 130 million," said the 58-year-old.
Looking back on the past, Grindel feels betrayed.
"Unfortunately, there have been people who have noticed this mistake and spied on the press instead of talking to me about it," Grindel said about the adoption of an expensive watch that led to his resignation in April 2019.
"This has already occupied me very much from a human point of view."
He received a gift worth around 11,000 euros from a Ukrainian official.
"I committed a compliance violation and it was right to draw the consequences," Grindel said.
"I handled the ominous watch gift completely transparently and without suspicion.
Many in the DFB knew about it."
He has never "made a secret of the gift," the 58-year-old assured.
"This may be called naïve, but in any case this form of transparency was the complete opposite of corruption."
"Black Lives Matter": Injured and one dead
Protests against police violence in the United States have picked up again due to Donald Trump’s deployment of federal police officers in several cities.
On Saturday, clashes broke out between demonstrators and police in various cities.
Three people were injured in Louisville and 16 people were arrested in Seattle.
In Austin, one person was killed by gunshots while a demonstration was crossing a crossroads.
Previously, clashes had occurred again in Portland during protests against racism and police violence.
The security forces, including federal police officers, used tear gas on the night of Saturday and forcibly dispersed demonstrators.
Hundreds of demonstrators, some armed, marched through Louisville, Kentucky on Saturday, demanding that those responsible for the death of Breonna Taylor be held accountable.
The 26-year-old student was shot dead in March during a drug raid at her home in Louisville.
The target of the raid was someone else who did not live there at all, and no drugs were found either.
On Saturday, three people were injured when a member of a group calling itself an armed alliance of black Americans fired a shot.
According to NBC, they were taken to the hospital.
None of them were in danger of life.
The police set up barricades because counter-demonstrators of a white militia had also formed.
In the end, the two groups did not meet.
In Austin, Texas, a person was shot and died in the course of a "Black Lives Matter" demonstration.
According to the police, one suspect was arrested.
She has not yet given any details of the circumstances.
Mayor Steve Adler told The New York Times that he, like many in the city, was "comfortable and dismayed" by what had happened.
Demonstrators also clashed with police in the American metropolis of Seattle on Saturday.
They set fire to a construction vehicle in front of a juvenile prison, and the police used grenades and pepper spray.
According to the Seattle Times, 16 people were arrested for resisting the police or for bodily harm.
A courthouse was set on fire in Oakland, California.
A small group of demonstrators broke windows, fireworks, and blinded police officers with lasers, Oakland Police reported late Saturday night (local time).
The fire was quickly extinguished.
In Aurora, a suburb of Denver, Colorado, a car drove past a crowd demonstrating on a highway.
According to police, one of the demonstrators fired a gun and at least one person was injured and taken to hospital.
In addition, windows were smashed in a courthouse and a fire was set, the police said.
Investigations were initiated.
Rakoczy in Bad Kissingen: Historical costumes defy Corona
Although the big sauce was missing in the spa town, visitors and performers enjoyed the Rakoczy flair of the alternative program.
It was unusual for visitors, performers and organizers: the Rakoczy weekend without the Rakoczy festival.
But: Even if the big party mile in the city center was missing, the crowds and program highlights like Saale burns, Rakoczy Ball or Festzug, yet many came at their expense with the Corona-compliant alternative program.
"I think we have succeeded in spreading Rakoczy flair," says curator Sylvie Thormann.
The guests would have accepted it well.
In principle, one returns to the beginnings of the Rakoczy festival, when only the historical ones were in the focus of the festival.
Pleasant atmosphere
Vesna Konhäuser and her husband have been attending the Rakoczy Festival in Bad Kissingen for more than 25 years.
So also this time in the Corona year.
The couple have made themselves comfortable at Luitpold Casino, watching the historians stroll around and listening to live Cuban music at the casino restaurant.
"I find it quite pleasant, too," says Konhäuser.
She misses the crowds that otherwise do not belong to Rakoczy.
However, it lacks the usual program highlights, especially Saale burning on Friday evening as well as the historic procession and the closing fireworks on Sunday evening.
"That's a pity.
The weather would have been great this year," she says.
Rakoczy equestrian tournament to be held again
For the actors of the historical spa guests, the alternative program meant partly more work.
For example, Christina Gold, who participates in the festivities in a normal year and can be seen there on the coach of the Kurgartencafé.
This year she was walking in costume in the city on Saturdays and Sundays.
"That's more strenuous, otherwise we'll have it easier," she says.
The riding club had less to do, even if individual riders were out and about in the park.
"We very much hope that the equestrian squadron will be able to take place again next year," says chairwoman Ulrike Waldhofen.
She announced that after a break of several years, a Rakoczy equestrian tournament would be held again in 2021.
28 Corona matches for Spanish Second Division side Fuenlabrada
The Spanish football second division club CF Fuenlabrada is sliding deeper and deeper into the crisis due to a corona outbreak.
Since the newcomer flew from the vicinity of Madrid despite the first Corona goals on 20 July to a game in the city of A Coruña, a low blow follows the next.
By Sunday, 28 players or team members had been positively tested, and one was hospitalized, according to the club.
Fuenlabrada from the city of the same name southwest of Madrid still had the chance to reach the playoffs.
Now it is even threatened with relegation to the B-group of the Second League.
The match against Deportivo La Coruña last Monday was cancelled at the last moment, the public prosecutor's office is investigating a possible offence against public health, the supreme sports authority CSD is considering the forced dismissal of the club.
The players and other team members sit in a hotel in quarantine.
"Until the sixth day of quarantine, they did not receive a fresh towel or gel," the sports newspaper "AS" wrote.
The photos show players hanging underwear and club clothes in their rooms in the hotel for drying after they apparently had to wash them themselves.
Furthermore, the bed linen had not been changed for five days.
Another problem is food.
Neither is it good nor sufficient, wrote "AS".
The club management, on the other hand, said they were satisfied with the hotel.
The accusation of deliberately endangering public health was rejected by the club's lawyer, Javier Tebas Llanas.
The son of the president of the Spanish Primera Division, Javier Tebas, stressed that the Corona rules established by the Football Association had not been violated, as reported by the news agency Europa Press and the sports newspaper "Marca".
Prior to the departure, there had been four infected persons up to 19 July, but all had been isolated and had not travelled with them.
Just before the flight to A Coruña on Monday, all players and team members had been re-tested.
When the team was already in A Coruña, the Corona test was positive for "five or six" other team members.
The game was cancelled 60 minutes before the kickoff, said Tebas Llanas.
Police have to catch torn horses at steam chase
Two animals were on the road.
The police led her back to her owner.
On Sunday morning, shortly before 6 a.m., a road user informed two free-running horses on the feeder between the junction Donnersdorf/Steinsfeld and the motorway junction Theres.
When the officers arrived, the horses were already between the feeder and the village of Dampfach.
Shortly before Dampfach, the officials were able to win the trust of the horses, who were each allowed to put on a rope carried in a striped wagon.
Cycling pro Tony Martin: career continuation imaginable
Time travel specialist Tony Martin is thinking about a continuation of his career.
Frankfurt/Main - Seven-time time trial world champion Tony Martin can well imagine continuing his cycling career.
"I am currently working with the team to determine the framework conditions, how and in what form it could continue," the 35-year-old told the "Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung".
Martin is currently employed by the Dutch team Jumbo-Visma and had considered ending his career after this year before the Corona break.
Negotiations with his team are also about the number of race days, he said.
Or other problems that would plague him as a father, Martin said.
Earlier he had stood up after a fall, and the first thought had been: "Quickly back on the bike.
Today, as the father of a little daughter, I think: What if?"
The cyclist admitted that there are aspects with which he finds it increasingly difficult.
"But it was good for me to remember from the Corona time what I do in cycling and how much fun it is for me."
The time trial specialist returns to competition at the Tour de l'Ain (5 to 9 August).
Bavaria: At least four dead on Bavaria’s streets over the weekend
The beautiful weather attracts bikers to the streets in many places.
For at least three people, the motorcycle tour ends deadly.
Also an 18 year old pedestrian dies.
Schönthal - Several people, mostly young people, died in accidents on Bavaria's streets on the weekend.
An 18-year-old motorcyclist was hit by a car on the reverse lane near Schönthal (Cham district) on Saturday.
At first, it was unclear why the car was on the opposite lane.
In Upper Bavaria, a 22-year-old collided with a horse-drawn carriage on Saturday.
According to the police, he was going downhill at Beilngries.
In a left turn he collided with the carriage.
His injuries were so severe that he died at the scene of the accident.
Of the twelve occupants of the carriage, one man was seriously injured and one man was slightly injured, according to the police.
An 18-year-old man died in another fatal accident in Bad Kötzting, Upper Palatinate.
He had laid down on a street on Sunday night and was overtaken by a 42-year-old driver.
According to the police, the 18-year-old wanted to sleep.
The driver could no longer brake in time.
At Schönberg (County of Freyung-Grafenau) on Saturday a 57-year-old biker collided frontally with a car in a right turn despite full braking.
He died at the scene of the accident.
The 57-year-old driver suffered a shock, the other three people in the car remained unharmed.
The safety of motorcyclists was discussed on Saturday by Bavaria's Transport Minister Kerstin Schreyer (CSU).
In a letter to the organizer of the biker protests against driving bans announced for August, Gabor Kovacs, the minister referred to extensive investments such as underride protection on ladders and the relaxation of dangerous curves.
"In recent years, we have achieved a great deal for the safety of motorcyclists," the letter said.
"The number of motorized two-wheelers killed decreased by around 28 percent compared to 2011."
Kovac tests with Monaco against Frankfurt
Frankfurt/Main (dpa) - Football manager Niko Kovac will soon be reunited with Eintracht Frankfurt with his new club AS Monaco.
The eight-time French champion will make a guest appearance at the Hessen, the former Club des Croats, on 1 August (18.00 a.m.).
For the Bundesliga team, it is the first and only hardship test before the return match in the Europa League against FC Basel (6 August).
Due to the coronavirus pandemic, the match is played without spectators.
"We are particularly looking forward to this game.
It's always nice to come to Frankfurt and meet friends," Kovac explained.
Sportingly, this is an interesting test, said the 48-year-old.
Prior to his move to Bayern Munich, Kovac had coached Hesse from 2016 to 2018 and led them to the DFB-Pokal.
"A top-class opponent like Monaco is a good test for us in the game against Basel.
Like all Frankfurters, I look forward to seeing Niko Kovac again," said Eintracht coach Adi Hütter.
The 50-year-old Austrian had succeeded the Croat in the coalition.
In March, the Frankfurter had lost the eighth-final match against Basel in their own stadium with 0:3.
Nearly 50 new infections: district Hof just past the lockdown
In the district of Hof, the number of known new coronary infections on the weekend increased further: from 39 on Friday and 43 on Saturday (one person recovered and no longer falls into this statistic) to 47 on Sunday.
In addition, there is a case in the town of Hof.
The Hof area is thus approaching the critical threshold of 50 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants in one week.
700 deaths due to monsoon rains in Southeast Asia
The severe floods in South-East Asia have affected more than 9 million people, mainly in Bangladesh, India and Nepal.
A total of 700 people were killed due to heavy monsoon rains.
In Bangladesh, the Red Crescent tries to reach the isolated people in boats.
Entire villages are under water.
The farmers have lost their crops.
Panzernashörner in National Park die by landslide
In Kaziranga National Park, several of the 120 Panzernas horns died from landslides.
They are protected and considered endangered.
This year, the floods are particularly severe, which scientists attribute to climate change.
Bangladesh is one of the countries most affected by global warming, according to the United Nations.
New apartments are empty
In the town of Cox's Bazar in southern Bangladesh, the state has built homes for 650 people displaced by the floods.
So far, only a few have moved in.
It is difficult to bring people to Cox's Bazar.
The enthusiasm is also maintained in Grenezn.
If you used to have a house, even if it was small and looked like a hut, you often don't want to spend your life in a big block of flats.
Many homes are empty, but the government wants them to be occupied soon by those who have lost their homes to the floods.

Argentina rejects counteroffer from creditors
The new requirements could not be met, the Ministry of Economy in Buenos Aires reported on Saturday.
"This would not only be irresponsible, it would also be unjust," a statement said.
"While 50 percent of children in Argentina live in poverty, we cannot increase the short-term profits of our creditors."
The debts of the second largest economy in South America are no longer sustainable under current conditions.
That is why Argentina is asking its private creditors to waive some of their claims of around 66 billion US dollars (about 59 billion euros).
If no agreement is reached, the country is once again threatened with bankruptcy.
It would be the ninth default in Argentine history.
Most recently, lenders had demanded higher interest rates on government bonds and changes to some contract clauses.
The Argentine government, however, is sticking to its last offer and is not prepared to make any further concessions.
Argentina is in a severe financial and economic crisis.
The inflation rate was last more than 50 percent.
For the current year, experts expect the economic strength to decline by around ten percent.
At the end of May, Argentina had defaulted on $503 million in interest payments, resulting in a limited default.
Professionally arrived - privately not yet
"It's going super well" - this is the conclusion Dr. Stefanie Kramer draws after her first days at the Notary Office in Eggenfelden.
In the end, everything went very quickly: In mid-May, Dr. Stefanie Kramer learned that she will succeed Lutz Feller at the Eggenfelden office.
Already six weeks later, at the beginning of July, the doctoral lawyer started work, the normal day-to-day business is already running at full speed.
"However, I still have to arrive privately," she explains in conversation with the Rottaler Anzeiger and laughs.
Of course, the short lead time was not enough to completely relocate the centre of business from Regensburg to Eggenfelden, reports Dingolfingerin.
Currently, she and her husband, who works in Regensburg as a judge at the regional court, are looking for a suitable apartment or house in the city.
At least her husband could still apply for parental leave at short notice in order to be able to take care of the two daughters (31⁄2 and 11⁄2 years old).
In order not to have to commute from Regensburg every day, she also has an overnight stay with her parents in Dingolfing, the 39-year-old explains.
Growing up in the neighbouring district, the town of Eggenfelden has, of course, been a familiar sight to her for a long time.
During visits on the spot with her family in the past months, she then remarked: "Eggenfelden is a really nice little town".
She was all the more pleased that she had competed in the selection process for the vacancy.
Her homeland of Lower Bavaria also plays a central role in Dr. Stefanie Kramer's professional career: After studying law in Passau, she completed her internship and the 2nd state examination in Regensburg.
After several stations as a notary, among others in Rehau and Hof in Oberfranken, Babenhausen in the Lower Allgäu and Regensburg - during this time she also "alongside" trained the doctorate in labour law - she entered her first position as a notary in Rotthalmünster in the district of Passau in 2012.
In 2016, she went on parental leave, which was eventually followed by the move to Regensburg.
Since then, she has served on various boards of directors.
When the job in Eggenfelden was advertised due to Lutz Feller's imminent retirement, she saw the right time for the full professional re-entry, explains the 39-year-old.
The team of her predecessor, who will in future take over the holiday representation in the notary's office, has completely taken over Dr. Stefanie Kramer - and immediately has a praise for the team of the law firm ready: "It's going super well!"
The fact that she can rely on established procedures here makes it easier for her to take care of the upcoming relocation of her private place of residence.
In terms of kindergarten and nativity scenes, she has already made contact with a local institution.
And everything works out as desired, she hopes to be able to pursue her hobby here soon - and to get to know the most beautiful jogging trails of the Rottal.
BVB plans to start the league with a maximum of 15,000 spectators
Dortmund The largest German football stadium in Dortmund will not even be filled to 20 percent at the start of the season in the event of a fan return.
"Due to the distance regulation, which must be complied with, we plan to have between 12,000 and 15,000 spectators according to the current situation," Carsten Cramer, managing director of Borussia Dortmund, told the "Tagesspiegel".
Normally, the arena in the district city holds slightly more than 81,000 spectators during Bundesliga matches.
In the ghost games caused by the Corona pandemic last season, BVB lost around four million euros per game.
Cramer, who is responsible for marketing, digitisation and internationalisation at the BVB, hopes that, in addition to the normal spectator seats, some of the approximately 4,000 seats in the hospitality area can be opened again: "It is of course a blow to the accounts if these revenues completely collapse."
In view of the continuing Corona crisis, all are currently "well advised to take a stable side-length first".
"If many companies are not doing well and 6.8 million people in Germany alone are in short-term employment, then the need for entertainment is limited," Cramer explained.
The Dortmund marketing chief praised the BVB professionals for their waiver, which is intended to help overcome the crisis: "Of course, the players know that their waiver has a different effect than if we put 100 people working in merchandising on short-term work."
Tiny miracles: Early start into life with a few hundred grams
Hardly heavier than a packet of butter, just three tablespoons of blood in his entire body: that was Gabriel when he was born - he weighed exactly 273 grams.
The boy is one of about 400 premature babies that are cared for annually at the Graz Children's Hospital.
A quarter of them weigh less than 1,500 grams, a few - like Gabriel and his brothers Raphael and Michael - are extreme lightweights with less than one kilogram of birth weight.
They are so small and born so early that neither lungs, intestines, nor muscles are fully developed.
Their skin is sometimes so delicate that they could injure the electrodes of an ECG.
And they are so tiny that they sometimes wear doll's clothing and specially made mini-pins for them.
But not so small that they would not be with voice - "and how", smiles Berndt Urlesberger.
"Even if, of course, they don't scream quite as loudly as big babies."
When the whiteboard becomes the stage
Despite Corona Theater in the classroom: The 9th grade of the Sankt-Jakobus-Gymnasium in Abtsgmünd experienced the whiteboard as a stage just before the start of the holidays.
Actress Julia Sylvester from the Theater der Stadt Aalen presented the production "Das Heimatkleid" to the pupils - via video.
Afterwards, the students were able to chat via Skype with the actress and director Winfried Tobias about the play and the performance.
The idea for the performance format was born out of the current Corona situation.
Teacher Teresa Nar was delighted with the enrichment of the lessons.
Although all participants agreed in the end that the direct encounter in the theatre and stage space would offer additional attractions, one sees the potential for contact in the schools in the theatre.
"If we improve the technical framework further, this could be an interesting addition to the operation of the game," said director Winfried Tobias.
First round draw: TSV 1860 would face Eintracht Frankfurt in the DFB-Pokal
Should TSV 1860 qualify for the DFB-Pokal, the Lions will face Eintracht Frankfurt in the first round.
This resulted in the draw on Sunday.
Munich - Sixty possible opponents in the first round of the DFB-Pokal have been determined.
The Lions would meet Eintracht Frankfurt in a successful qualification.
This resulted in the draw on Sunday evening in the ARD Sports Show.
Because of the corona pandemic, the field of participants is not yet complete, placeholders were used in the draw.
Due to the voluntary surrender of semi-final opponents FC Memmingen, TSV 1860 is already in the final of the Bavarian Toto Cup (September 4 or 5).
There the Lions meet either the Würzburg Kickers or Viktoria Aschaffenburg.
If Würzburg were to reach the final, Sixty would already be qualified for the first round of the DFB-Pokal.
Otherwise, the Giesinger would have to prevail in the final against regional league Aschaffenburg.
The first round of the DFB-Pokal will be played between 11 and 14 September, one week before the start of the Third League.
"The Wind Blows": Film legend Olivia de Havilland is dead
The film legend and Oscar winner Olivia de Havilland is dead.
She died of natural causes on Sunday in Paris at the age of 104, her spokeswoman for the German Press Agency confirmed.
De Havilland was known for her role as Melanie Hamilton in the South American epic "Vom Winde verweht" (1939).
Born to British parents in Tokyo, Olivia de Havilland moved to California as a young child.
The Austrian theatre artist Max Reinhardt discovered the 19-year-old in the role of Hermia in Shakespeare's "Summer Night's Dream".
Warner Brothers signed her to a seven-year contract and produced her alongside Eroll Flynn.
She made eight films with the Heartbreaker.
In 1946 she won her first Oscar in the leading role of "To Each His Own".
The film was released in Germany under the title "Mutterherz".
Three years later she won the award for Best Actress in William Wyler's "The Heiress".
She also received much recognition as a neurotic eccentric in "Der dunkle Spiegel" and "Die Schlangengrube".
Daphne du Maurier suggested her in 1952 for the leading role in the film adaptation of her novel "Meine Cousine Rachel".
The play became a worldwide success.
With her longtime friend Bette Davis she played in "Wiegenlied für eine Leiche".
He married writer Marcus Goodrich (1946–1953) and had a son, Benjamin Goodrich.
In Paris, de Havilland married the journalist Pierre Paul Galante and had a daughter Gisèle with him.
This marriage also broke down.
Rumours of an affair with former British Prime Minister Edward Heath were never confirmed.
"Road to Timmendorf": Beach volleyball: Thole/Wickler miss finals at Comeback
The World Cup runners-up Julius Thole and Clemens Wickler missed the final at the beach volleyball tournament "Road to Timmendorf".
At the meeting of the top teams in Düsseldorf they lost in the semi-finals to their national team colleagues Nils Ehlers and Lars Flüggen with 1:2 (17:21, 21:17, 19:21).
The last time Thole/Wickler played was at the World Tour Final in Rome last September.
In the final on the Rhine, their opponents Ehlers/Flüggen defeated the surprise team Lukas Pfretschner and his interim partner Steven van de Velde 0:2 (17:21, 17:21).
In addition to the show tournament, three starting places for the German Championships were played in Timmendorfer Strand at the beginning of September: Tickets were secured by Armin Dollinger/Simon Kulzer, Manuel Harms/Richard Peemüller and Simon Pfretschner/Milan Sievers.
Kalbitz ejection from AfD confirmed - FDP speaks of "Feigenblatt"
The exclusion of Andreas Kalbitz from the AfD is, in the view of the FDP, only a "face sheet" and does not change the character of the party.
"The AfD is the parliamentary arm of the extreme right in Germany.
Andreas Kalbitz is only part of the top of the iceberg of radicals in the AfD," said FDP Interior Minister Benjamin Strasser to the Berlin-based news agency dpa.
The Federal Arbitration Court of the AfD had confirmed the exclusion of Kalbitz on Saturday in Stuttgart after several hours of negotiations, which the Federal Board had decided by a majority in May.
Kalbitz is the chairman of the AfD Group in the Brandenburg state parliament.
"If the AfD really was about consistently removing right-wing extremists from their party, functionaries like Björn Höcke and his supporters would have long been excluded," Strasser said.
"However, there is no political will for this in the AfD, because right-wing extremism is now part of the party."
CSU General Secretary Markus Blume expressed a similar view: "The fact that Andreas Kalbitz is now excluded says nothing and does not change anything," he told "Welt am Sonntag".
"It speaks volumes about how many frenetic supporters a right-wing extremist still has in the middle of the AfD."
Blume expects the AfD to fall below five percent in future elections.
"The days of the AfD in the parliaments are numbered".
Kalbitz was one of the spokesmen for the now officially dissolved "wing" around the Thuringian AfD country and faction chairman Björn Höcke; the constitutional protection classifies the coronation as a "guaranteed right-wing extremist aspiration".
In May, the AfD leadership expelled Kalbitz from the party.
As a reason, he stated that Kalbitz had not indicated a previous membership in the now banned far-right "Homeland-Faithful German Youth" (HDJ) and among the Republicans when he joined the party.
Kalbitz denies membership in the HDJ.
Sebastian Walter, chairman of the left-wing parliamentary group in Brandenburg, also stressed that the Federal Arbitration Court's decision did not change the character of the AfD: "The wolf only ate chalk.
The AfD remains a far-right party, with or without Kalbitz."
With this decision, neither the Federal Party nor the right wing will be weakened.
"The maneuver of the mutineers is transparent.
One wants to avoid further observation by the constitutional protection and tries to get through under the radar," said Walter.
"The AfD will not let go of the spirits it called.
A dismissal does not change anything," commented the Brandenburg SPD Secretary-General Erik Stohn on the decision in the Kalbitz case.
"Here, the AfD-Landesverband and the faction remained to this day their rightful leader."
The legal dispute over Kalbitz's membership in the AfD will continue.
He announced on Saturday that he would now take civil action against the Federal Arbitration Court's decision.
North Sea wind farms deliver a good 21 percent more electricity
The wind power plants on the German North Sea supplied 11.51 terawatt hours of electricity to the grid in the first six months of the year.
This is a good 21 percent more than in the same period of the previous year, said the network operator Tennet in Bayreuth.
Tennet is responsible for the transmission of the North Sea electricity to the mainland and the transmission through the German electricity grid.
The wind turbines on the Baltic Sea, which are not part of Tennet's grid area, have supplied a further 2.22 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity.
Overall, wind power from the North and Baltic Sea thus comes to 13.73 TWh, compared to a good 11.64 TWh in the first half of 2019.
The wind harvest at sea thus accounts for almost 19 percent of the total wind power in Germany; this is about four percentage points more than a year ago.
New wind farms ensure higher generation capacities
In addition to the wind conditions, the increased contribution of offshore wind energy results from higher generation capacities, because new wind farms have been connected to the grid in the past twelve months.
If the 1270 wind farms in the North Sea were all running at full power at the same time, they could generate 6.7 gigawatts of electricity.
The transmission capacity is sufficient; according to Tennet, it is 7.1 gigawatts.
By 2030, it is expected to rise to 17 gigawatts in the German North Sea.
"In Germany and the Netherlands, we will invest 20 billion euros in the expansion of offshore grid connections by then," said Tennet Managing Director Tim Meyerjürgens.
In reality, even at sea, wind farms cannot use up their capacity, reaching around 40 percent.
The record day so far this year is 2 January, when the North Sea wind farms generated more than six gigawatts of electricity.
On average, the North Sea wind turbines produce about 2.5 to 3.0 gigawatts of electricity, which corresponds to three to four nuclear power plants.
This could provide electricity to almost seven million households.
Art "Skirmish" - an exhibition of the Leipzig artist Christian Bold in the gallery of the Gmünder Kunstverein.
This was almost a small celebration of the 130th anniversary.
Birthday of the Gmünder Kunstverein: The opening of the exhibition "Skirmish" with works by the Leipzig artist Christian Bold broke the usual framework after the Corona break.
Much more art lovers than usual followed the dialogue between the artist and the chairman of the art association, Professor Dr. Klaus Ripper.
The musical equivalent was provided by the band "Defenders of the Universe" on the southern Kornhausplatz.
North of the gallery the association "Sandtogether" was involved.
Freital: Windbergfest cancelled due to Corona
The Windbergfest does not take place this year.
The city of Freital has cancelled the three-day festival planned for September.
In other years, more than 30,000 people had attended this city festival.
"We really did not take this decision lightly and - aware of how difficult it is economically for the parties involved - hoped until the last minute," said Mayor Uwe Rumberg (non-partisan).
"But ultimately, we are responsible for the health of many thousands of people here as organisers."
If tens of thousands of people had poured into the festival grounds and tents, minimum distances, hygiene regulations and contact tracing in accordance with the current Corona Protection Regulation could not have been complied with.
Or the restrictions would have been so strong that there would not have been much left of a folk festival.
Furthermore, the organisational and monitoring effort would increase disproportionately by many times.
Rumberg looked forward to the next year.
Then the city of Freital will celebrate its 100th anniversary with the Winterbergfest from 7 to 9 May 2021 and the Day of Saxony from 10 to 12 September 2021.
Dressage Olympic champion Werth in gliding not to beat
Achleiten - The six-time Olympic champion Isabell Werth was the outstanding rider at the dressage tournament in Achleiten, Austria.
The 51-year-old from Rheinberg came to four victories in four starts at the weekend.
After winning a Grand Prix with Weihegold and Quantaz at the start, she was also unable to beat on Sunday in the Grand Prix Special and in the freestyle.
On the 15-year-old mare Weihegold Werth on Sunday in the special clearly prevailed against the Austrian Victoria Max-Theurer on Abegglen.
Also in the freestyle, the German was clearly ahead of her 34-year-old pupil Victoria Max-Theurer on Quantaz on Saturday.
Werth's winning horse Quantaz belongs to Max-Theurer.
The most successful dressage rider in the world is to establish the ten-year-old stallion in the Grand Prix.
For Quantaz it was the first freestyle ever.
Already at the first tournament in Achleiten three weeks ago Werth had won all four important tests.
The last of the three international tournaments is scheduled for 14-16 August.
More air traffic controllers in Worms in the future
Worms University of Applied Sciences goes further in the air: "DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung" donates a professorship for "Air Traffic Management".
A corresponding contract between the university and DFS has now been signed in Worms.
The contract was initially signed for three years and will start in 2021.
With the professorship, it is possible to start studying not only in the summer semester, but also in the winter semester.
This will enable twice as many students to be trained as before.
At the same time, the capacities at both the university and the DFS Air Traffic Control Academy will be used equally.
The DFS will advise the university on the establishment and appointment of the professorship.
Represented at the University of Applied Sciences since 2019
Since the summer semester 2019, the first students in their training as air traffic controllers at Worms University of Applied Sciences are in the Air Traffic Management programme.
Nine students have already started this year.
So far, the experiences of the DFS have been very positive, and the achievements of the students are outstanding.
The combination of studies and pilot training contributes significantly to further increasing the attractiveness of the pilot profession.
"In these times, the promotion is not easy for us economically.
However, we are confident that air traffic will recover and grow again in the long term.
In order to continue fulfilling our legal mandate in the future, we need highly qualified personnel," said Professor Klaus-Dieter Scheurle, Chairman and CEO of DFS, when signing the contract.
"For DFS, the foundation professorship is a future-proof investment that will provide air traffic controllers with a broad, multidisciplinary knowledge base in the long term.
We are therefore continuing the good cooperation with the university and at the same time underpinning our attractiveness as an employer."
Professor Dr. Jens Hermsdorf, President of Worms University of Applied Sciences, also underlines this: "The endowed professorship forms an important bridge between science and business.
With her, we would like to build on the already existing cooperation with DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung as a practical partner for the dual bachelor's degree programme Air Traffic Management."
The trust of German Air Traffic Control is both a motivation and an obligation for Worms University of Applied Sciences to further develop its teaching and research competence in the future fields of air transport.
With the first endowed professorship for a dual degree programme, the university will be able to set very special highlights and innovative priorities for its students when deployed for the air traffic controllers of tomorrow.
Dr. Denis Alt, State Secretary at the Ministry of Science, Further Education and Culture, emphasises: "With its focus on air transport, Worms University of Applied Sciences has a unique position in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Today's signing of the cooperation agreement strengthens the university's profile."
Rescue helicopter lands on the A 45
On Saturday afternoon, the A 45 motorway towards Aschaffenburg was closed for about 30 minutes because the rescue helicopter was in use after a traffic accident.
A 76-year-old driver drove a Ford straight in the curve at 12:40 in the Alzenau-Mitte exit and landed on the ladder.
The crash caused the front airbags to detonate, and the driver suffered minor facial injuries and had to be taken to a hospital for treatment.
The injuries of the 72-year-old passenger were attended to by an emergency doctor and the patient was subsequently flown to a hospital by rescue helicopter.
At present, however, the police assume that there is no risk to life.
The damaged vehicle, which caused damage of about 2000 euros, had to be towed away.
Heil wants to examine other industries after meat industry
The Corona crisis brought to light the situation in parts of the meat industry.
Legislative amendments are imminent.
But are they right - and will it stay that way?
Federal Labour Minister Hubertus Heil (SPD) wants to review other sectors according to the now planned strict regulations against malpractices in the meat industry.
"We will look at industry by industry and then take appropriate measures for the respective industry if necessary," Heil told the German Press Agency in Berlin.
Germany's employers are already warning against restricting work contracts in general.
Following the massive corona outbreak at the meat giant Tönnies in North Rhine-Westphalia, the Federal Cabinet wants to pass a law of salvation this Wednesday.
Large slaughterhouses should no longer be allowed to employ third-party personnel for slaughter, cutting and meat processing.
To this end, the use of contract and temporary workers is to be prohibited there.
Employer President Ingo Kramer told the dpa: "Finger away from a general restriction of work contracts and transfer of workers if you do not want to completely strangle the economy".
For example, factory contracts are the essential basis for the creation of value for the customer in large areas of the crafts, construction and plant engineering industries.
"Individual failures cannot destroy such an important instrument."
Heil assured: "My aim is not to ban works contracts everywhere in the German economy."
Work contracts are meaningful.
"When an industrial company hires a craftsman to install a safety system, it's a normal contract."
The German meat industry considers a ban on work contracts and temporary work in its sector alone to be unconstitutional.
It is not possible to explain why, in future, different labour law should apply to the portioning and packaging of cheese than to sausage, according to an opinion on the bill, as the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" (Saturday) reports.
In the event of a ban, the consumer price would rise by 10 to 20 percent per kilo and product.
According to the results of an examination by the North Rhine-Westphalia Employment Protection Administration, many Eastern European employees from work contract companies worked partly 16 hours a day in the industry.
Often they did not have a break.
Salary was retained for protective equipment or rent.
It was also noted that the situation with the accommodation of employees was often miserable.
Heil said that a relatively strict law had already entered into force for the meat industry in 2017.
However, these were bypassed by "tricky constructions".
"Now it is essential to clean up."
The politician announced: "In the Occupational Health and Safety Act, which we want to adopt in the cabinet at the end of July, there are also measures that do not only concern the meat industry - for example, higher inspection rates for occupational health and safety or clear criteria for communal accommodation".
The draft presented by the dpa includes amendments to the Law on the Protection of Employees' Rights in the Meat Industry and the Labour Protection Act.
Brandenburg's Consumer Protection Minister Ursula Nonnemacher (Greens) believes that more intensive controls are necessary.
"I would like us to be able to carry out even more controls in many supervisory areas: food controls, animal welfare, everything possible, including animal transport, for example," Nonnemacher said on Sunday in the RBB programme "Brandenburg aktuell".
But more controls would also require more human resources.
Three dead in crash of ultralight aircraft in Germany
According to the police, three people died in the crash of an ultralight aircraft on a multi-family house in Wesel in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia.
A child was slightly injured.
Two other people were injured in the accident and were rescued, said a spokesman for the Wesel district headquarters.
A parachute was found at the scene of the accident, according to the police.
The "Rheinische Post" reported, citing eyewitnesses, that before the crash the aircraft collided with a hot air balloon.
The house is a single-family or two-family house.
Further details were not known at first.
Removal of Frankfurt Opera Square proceeded peacefully
A week after the riots in Frankfurt, the evacuation of the Opernplatz took place peacefully on Sunday night.
Lastly, a few dozen people remained in the square, but left before the curfew at 1 a.m.
The police had been deployed with numerous officers since the early evening, and there was a larger police presence throughout the city.
For the first time this weekend, from midnight onwards, there was a ban on visiting the Opera Square, which had been the scene of riots a week ago.
Police officers were attacked with bottles from the crowd of people celebrating.
At least five police officers were injured and several police vehicles were damaged.
The night to Saturday had also remained quiet.
Car collides: Young woman seriously injured in an accident on Bundesstraße 83 near Hofgeismar
A 21-year-old suffered serious injuries in an accident between Schöneberg and Hümme on Sunday at around 1.25 p.m.
She was taken to the Kassel Clinic.
With thermal imaging cameras, the fire brigade searched for possible passengers.
According to the police, the woman was driving on Bundesstraße 83 towards her home town of Hümme when her car broke off the road for an unexplained reason and crashed several times.
To save the victims, the fire department had to cut off the roof of the car.
Since it was unclear whether anyone else was in the vehicle, the adjacent corn field was searched from the ladder with a thermal imaging camera.
Also the drone squadron from Warburg, which also works with thermal imaging cameras, had been ordered for the search.
However, the forces did not find anyone among the tall corn plants.
The seriously injured were taken by ambulance to the Kassel hospital for further treatment.
Almost 50 firefighters from the Hofgeismar, Hümme and Schöneberg fire departments were on site.
The road was closed for two hours due to the accident.
Juventus Turin Champions in Italy
Turin - After a redeeming goal by Cristiano Ronaldo, record champion Juventus Turin has secured the Italian championship for the ninth time in a row.
The team around the five-time world footballer made the 36th Scudetto in the history of the club with a 2-0 (1:0) on Sunday evening in the home game against Sampdoria Genoa perfect.
Ronaldo scored 1–0 before halftime.
With 83 points, Turin, which started without the last long-injured ex-national player Sami Khedira, is no longer out of first place two games before the end of the season in Serie A.
The second place Inter Milan is seven points behind.
Juventus were harmless in the first half despite the optical superiority, then Ronaldo scored after a free kick with the last action.
The 35-year-old took advantage of an encore by Miralem Pjanic from the penalty area with a flat shot (45.+7).
Against the now more offensive guests Ronaldo was also involved in 2:0, after his shot Federico Bernardeschi (67.) dust off.
Thus the gloomless but decisive success was assured.
The penalty thrown at Latte in the 89th minute should only have really annoyed Ronaldo himself with regard to the goal scorer rating.
"It's difficult to stay mentally and physically at the ball for 90 minutes.
The games are strange and the momentum is changing very slightly," said coach Maurizio Sarri after the 1:2 win over Udinese Calcio on Thursday.
Above all, the mental exhaustion of his players is great, said the Juve coach.
Because of the defeat, the Turks had not yet been able to make the championship perfect.
In the end, Juve's reassuring lead at the top of the table was mainly due to the weakness of the competitors.
After all, in the eleven games before the game on Sunday, the Sarri team had only managed five victories.
Whether Ronaldo will also become a goalkeeper king is questionable.
Because while the Portuguese superstar has scored 31 goals so far, the former Dortmunder Ciro Immobile has already 34 goals on his account after his three-pack at 5:1 (1:1) of the fourth-placed Lazio Rome at Hellas Verona - as many as Robert Lewandowski contributed to the title win of FC Bayern.
The record in Italy is held by the current Juve-Profi Gonzalo Higuaín.
He scored 36 goals for SSC Naples in the 2015–16 season.
In August, the "Old Lady" of Italian football is waiting for the next chance to win the title.
Juventus are in the Champions League quarter-finals, but will have to face Olympique Lyon 0–1 on 7 August in order to reach the finals in Lisbon.
In the next knockout round, Real Madrid or Manchester City would wait as opponents.
Baden-Württemberg: Over 250 illegal car races recorded
Stuttgart - Despite all the threatened penalties and court rulings, drivers continue to give gas in countless illegal races on the Baden-Württemberg roads: In the past year and the first four months of this year, the police in the southwest have already registered more than 250 illegal car races.
There are no comparable figures for the years before, but the racers are increasingly making the judicial authorities work: In the prosecutors' offices between Konstanz and Mannheim a total of 155 investigations were conducted in 2018 for illegal races, a year later there were already 252 and in the current year up to the beginning of June already 151.
The races were less about organized events, according to the reply of the Ministry of the Interior to a request from the Landtag SPD.
In most cases, the drivers spontaneously competed against each other or fled from the police - also this is indicated as an illegal race.
The drivers were mostly German men between the ages of 18 and 60.
113 fines - 15 times imprisonment
Only in comparatively few cases are the rasers caught and also asked to pay: According to the Ministry of the Interior, a total of 113 fines have been imposed and 15 prison sentences pronounced since 2018.
However, there is no evidence that the number of illegal car races is actually increasing.
On the contrary, other drivers reacted more sensitively than before because of the numerous tragic accidents and trials in recent years and showed more often, said a ministry spokesman.
Especially popular in Rasern is the highway 8. Again and again, drivers stop the traffic there in order to make room and use the free space for a race.
Last August, a dozen drivers were caught near Kirchheim unter Teck, three months earlier there were even 18 drivers on the A8 near Merklingen.
A81 is the most popular "race track"
On the A81, the police register even more races than on any other federal motorway.
A speed limit is used to try to slow down the lawnmower on the particularly affected section between narrows and grooves.
The mostly high-priced and mottled sports and luxury cars often have Swiss license plates, because the drivers avoid the lawn to Germany because of the high penalties for driving too fast and car racing in the neighbouring country.
For the SPD, the speed limit must not be reduced to a few stretches: "With a general speed limit of 130 kilometres per hour, we would get rid of this problem on motorways," says Martin Rivoir, the transport expert for the SPD parliamentary group.
"The threshold for Raser would be significantly higher if you weren't allowed to be on the road here and there legally with 200 kilometres per hour and more."
Rivoir thinks less of education or image campaigns: "Anyone who ignores all the rules in this way and puts not only his own life but also the lives of other road users at risk is hardly attainable with reason."
ADAC calls for stronger police crackdown
However, this is not enough for the ADAC: "We assume that racers will not be deterred by the speed limits," says Holger Bach, Head of Transport and Environment at the ADAC Württemberg.
It calls for additional and even tougher controls on the affected routes.
Not infrequently, the high-speed endurance race becomes more painful and serious: since January 2019 and until April 2020, three people have died in the races nationwide, two of them injured in a night crash in Stuttgart's city centre and one in Gerlingen.
There, two young men are said to have raced a car in November.
One of the vehicles came off the road, crashed against a garden wall and lay on the side, the 18-year-old passenger died.
Twenty-one other people were injured in the races of the past two years.
In the opinion of Interior Minister Thomas Strobl, however, stricter penalties are not necessary: "No legislative action is needed to impose stricter penalties on illegal motor racing," reads the paper by the Interior Ministry.
Blue light of July 23: Thirsty burglar steals drinks from snack bar
Rohrdorf: A man broke into a snack bar in Rohrdorf (Calw district) on Thursday and stole drinks and cash.
A witness heard noises in the valley road at around 3.40 a.m. and ran towards the snack bar.
There he noticed a man using the fridge with drinks and leaving the snack afterwards through a previously opened entrance door.
The perpetrator fled towards the meadows behind the snack bar.
According to police, the burglar also used a cash register and stole cash in the low three-digit range.
The suspect is described as follows: He is about 1.75 to 1.80 meters tall and of strong stature.
In fact, he wore a black hooded sweater, black trousers and light shoes.
Further witness statements are received by the police.
Ackermann sprints to victory on final stage at Sibiu Tour
Cycling pro Pascal Ackermann has won his second day on the final stage of the 10th Sibiu Tour.
The 26-year-old Palatinate rider from Team Bora-hansgrohe won the mass sprint on the 109 kilometre long section with start and finish in Hermannstadt after winning one stage on Saturday.
It was the season's third and fourth victories for Ackermann.
In the overall ranking, his Austrian teammate Gregor Mühlberger prevailed.
The 26-year-old had confidently decided on mountain time trials in the morning and thus took the top spot in the classification.
Only 104 riders had entered the final stage in the evening.
No less than 18 starters had fallen victim to the time limit in mountain time trials.
"I'm really happy to start the new season with a victory," Ackermann said after his success on Saturday.
"The sprint was really hectic," said the 26-year-old.
300 meters before the finish, he simply put on his sprint, "and it also worked perfectly".
According to the rules of the UCI, all participants and their companions were subjected to a corona test six days before the start of the race.
During the entire tour, drivers and supervisors were separated from the organizing team and the media in isolated hygiene booths.
Spectators at the start and finish were not allowed.
Headquarters gave instructions for lay persons to be resuscitated
Düsseldorf - Tragic accident on Sunday afternoon in Düsseldorf-Garath.
In a multi-family house, a child (4) suddenly lay lifeless in the water while bathing.
According to the fire department, the emergency call arrived just before 1:00 p.m.
"A control station dispatcher immediately gave instructions for the layman's resuscitation," a firefighter spokesman told BILD.
The incoming rescue workers took over the recovery measures shortly afterwards.
The life-threatening child was transported to the university hospital under resuscitation.
Why it crashed is unclear.
The police routinely investigated the accident.
The fire department spokesperson: "We assume that there was a tragic accident in the apartment."
Nuremberg: Unauthorised tuning meeting - Police intervene, 700 vehicles and around 1100 people
Hundreds of cars and, at times, more than 1,000 people took part in a "tuning meeting" on Saturday night in the parking lot of a furniture store.
The police implemented their announcement to tighten control over such events.
A large tuning meeting took place on Saturday evening (July 25, 2020) in Nuremberg's Südstadt.
Several hundred vehicles were involved.
According to the police of Mittelfranken, around 10.30 p.m., the Nuremberg traffic police detected an increased number of vehicles in the area of a large parking lot on Ingolstädter Straße.
As a result, the police carried out a large number of vehicle checks there.
Only recently, the police had announced that they wanted to step up their action against so-called autoposers.
Illegal tuning meeting in Nuremberg: Only a small part of the "scene"
The officials counted at the top a good 700 vehicles and about 1100 people, the police estimates.
However, only a small part of those present can be attributed to the "autoposer" and tuning scene.
Apparently, most of the scene was in response to the police's appeal.
On the basis of the vehicles and persons on site, it can be assumed that these were mainly show-goers.
In addition, the majority of those present complied with the applicable infection protection regulations, in particular the adherence to the minimum distance and the wearing of a mouth-to-nose protection.
The on-site inspections were completed at around 1:00 a.m.
In total, the officials found 10 vehicles with such structural changes that the operating permit had expired.
Four of these vehicles had to be secured.
No Car Racing
There were no illegal car races.
"The Police Presidium Mittelfranken will continue to keep an eye on what is happening and will continue to carry out enhanced control measures, also in connection with the rise of show-loving people," it said.
News5 spoke with Jürgen Schrödinger of the towing company involved: "They all have beautiful rims, which we must not scratch," said Schrödinger.
For this purpose, special tapes would be used.
Also because the cars are wider, the company must be careful not to damage them.
"The young people should get their cars back safely after all."
Employment agency figures: 900 suspected cases of short-time work abuse
Berlin - According to its own statement, the Federal Employment Agency (BA) is investigating around 900 suspected cases of abuse of short-term workers' money.
"This is extremely little for more than 880,000 companies that have reported short-time work," Daniel Terzenbach, the managing director responsible for the operational business, told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung.
When, at the beginning of the Corona crisis, a large number of companies suddenly applied for short-term work, BA had to react quickly.
Usually the examination lasts up to three weeks.
"We didn't have that much time at our disposal in this hot phase.
That is why we will look more closely at the final accounts.
There will certainly be more to come.
We are not naive and have a long breath".
Indications of abuse often come from the employees or unions concerned.
In addition, use the BA analysis software to detect abuse patterns.
According to Terzenbach, the BA is preparing for a possible bankruptcy wave in the autumn.
"Will there be significantly more insolvencies than in the previous year?
Estimates vary, but we are preparing for the event and are already training our employees in the employment agencies to process applications for insolvency funds."
The figures are still inconspicuous, Terzenbach said.
World Heritage in Potsdam: Party in the New Garden dissolved
Potsdam - On Friday evening about 40 young people celebrated a party in the New Garden.
The assembly had been dissolved at 8.48 p.m. by the district drivers of the Prussian Palaces and Gardens Foundation (SPSG), the foundation informed on PNN request.
The teenagers then left the park.
On Saturday evening, some young people would have played rugby in the New Garden.
The meadow had been cleared by area drivers, SPSG spokesman Frank Kallensee said on Sunday.
Again and again there are illegal celebrations in the parks
In the parks of the Foundation, there are repeatedly accumulations in which the spacing and hygiene rules of the Covid-19 Congestion Regulation are not observed.
At the end of June there was a celebration with about 300 people in the Park Babelsberg, a week later about 150 people celebrated in the New Garden.
Even without the Corona Regulation, the parks are closed at nightfall.
Camping on the meadows is forbidden according to park regulations, there are only a few exceptions.
The foundation has been complaining for a long time that visitors are leaving more and more rubbish behind and destroying protected biotopes.
Meanwhile, illegal park parties in Berlin have reached a different dimension.
In the Hasenheide in the district of Neukölln, 5,000 people celebrated an illegal techno party on the night of Sunday.
The event was cancelled by the police.
Austria: Mass tests after Corona eruption in tourist resort
With hundreds of tests, authorities have responded to a corona outbreak in the popular Upper Austrian tourist resort of St. Wolfgang.
The number of confirmed cases rose to 48, according to the state authorities in Linz.
More than 100 results were still outstanding in the evening.
According to this, many of the infected are young interns in tourism companies, but at least one holiday guest was positively tested.
Residents, guests and tourists were asked to stay in their accommodations on Saturday evening.
The closing time was set at 11 p.m.
"There are cancellations and cancellations" of bookings, said the head of the Tourism Association Wolfgangsee, Hans Wieser, the dpa.
There were also some guests who left early.
St. Wolfgang is the most important tourist resort in Upper Austria, with more than 400,000 overnight stays last year.
In a normal season, about one third of the guests are German.
On Friday, the first infections had become public.
The head of the district authority, Alois Lanz, defended on Saturday the behavior of the trainees, who had celebrated in several restaurants and could have been infected there.
"We all liked to do that in our youth," he told the Ö1 radio station.
However, two bars were closed on Friday to prevent further infections.
The Tourist Board launched an information campaign to raise awareness among young employees of the dangers of Covid-19.
From Saturday, hundreds of employees, holidaymakers and locals were tested.
In addition, all guests who were in St. Wolfgang from 15 July were contacted.
The outbreak evokes memories of the Austrian ski and party resort of Ischgl in Tyrol, which was a centre of corona spread throughout Europe in the early phase of the pandemic.
In total, more than 1500 people are currently infected with the virus in Austria.
The focus of new infections is on Vienna and Upper Austria.
Premier League: Man United and Chelsea qualify for Champions League
London (dpa) - The English football record champion Manchester United returns to the Champions League after a year absence.
The Red Devils finished third in the Premier League with a 2–0 (0–0) victory over Leicester City.
The Foxes now have to settle for the Europa League, because Chelsea were still passing by and qualified for the league in fourth place.
In the fight against the descent, Aston Villa was allowed to cheer.
Manchester United took the lead with a penalty from Bruno Fernandes in the 71st minute.
After a red card for Leicester City in the postseason, Jesse Lingard (90.+8) scored in the final.
Chelsea, in the Champions League quarter-finals opponents of FC Bayern, won thanks to Mason Mount (45.+1) and Olivier Giroud (45.+4) in parallel with 2:0 (2:0) against Wolverhampton Wanderers.
"It means a lot to me," said coach Frank Lampard, who also faced Arsenal in the FA Cup final in his first season as Chelsea coach.
Tottenham Hotspur also benefited from Chelsea's victory over Wolverhampton, as they beat the Wolves 1–0 at Crystal Palace and finished sixth in the Europa League.
Aston Villa faced Watford and AFC Bournemouth in a long-distance duel, but West Ham United struggled to retain a place in the league.
The late lead of Jack Grealish (84th) was immediately replaced by Andrej Jarmolenko (85th).
The 1–1 (0–0) was enough, however, because Watford lost 2–3 (1–3) to Arsenal.
The club, which had three coaches in the season, dropped out after five seasons in the first division.
Like Bournemouth, who could not save themselves by a 3-1 (2:1) at Everton.
In the end, one point was missing.
Liverpool, who have been the English champions since the end of June, secured a club record with a 3-1 (1:1) victory at Newcastle United.
99 points is the highest score the Reds have ever scored in a football season.
Coach Jürgen Klopp and his team barely missed the points record in English football.
Manchester City holds the record with 100 points in the 2017/18 season.
Following Newcastle's first-minute lead, Virgil van Dijk (38th), Divock Origi (59th) and Sadio Mané (89th) made Liverpool's debut on Sunday.
"It was an extraordinary season for this wonderful club," said goalkeeper van Dijk after the game, "which should encourage us to defend the title.
It's going to be hard."
The Premier League bosses should also be satisfied in the end.
Due to the coronavirus crisis, football operations in England were suspended from 13 March to 17 June.
In the meantime, it was even discussed whether to cancel the remaining games prematurely or to hold them on neutral ground.
In the end, however, the season could be played without any special events - but as in Germany without spectators in the stadiums.
Arrests and violence during demonstrations against Netanyahu
The protests in Israel against Prime Minister Netanyahu are getting stronger and stronger.
Violent clashes broke out during the night.
The Israeli police violently assaulted participants in a demonstration in Jerusalem on Sunday night against right-wing conservative Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
Twelve people were arrested for participating in the riots, police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said.
Among other things, the police used water cannons to disperse the rally.
A total of 6,000 people gathered near Netanyahu's office on Saturday evening, according to media reports.
They protested against unemployment, corruption and Netanyahu's handling of the Corona crisis.
The protesters beat drums, blew horns, and called on Netanyahu to resign.
Participants of a counter-demonstration supporting Netanyahu were also arrested, the news site "ynet" reported.
People also demonstrated in many other places in Israel, including in front of the head of government's private villa in the coastal city of Caesarea and in a park in Tel Aviv.
A man was reportedly arrested near Tel Aviv on suspicion of spraying pepper spray from a moving car on demonstrators on the side of the road.
Another man was arrested after a knife attack on a demonstrator in the south of the country.
The demonstrator was slightly injured in the neck.
In Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, there have recently been several demonstrations against Netanyahu.
The demonstrations accompany the corruption process against the head of government.
Recently, Netanyahu has also been criticized for his handling of the Corona crisis.
Among other things, he is told about premature easing and a lack of preparation for a second corona wave.
The Corona crisis has severely damaged the country's economy.
The unemployment rate recently stood at more than 20 percent.
The number of new infections with coronavirus in Israel has recently risen to new record levels.
Accident at Ahlen (NRW) - Transporter crashes on car - nine injured - Ruhr area - Bild.de
Ahlen - A collision on Saturday afternoon on the B58 near Ahlen left nine people slightly injured.
A female driver was on her way to Beckum with her two children (3, 5).
The police: "Probably she had stopped suddenly because she wanted to turn."
The driver of a Mercedes van driving behind her must have seen this too late.
He crashed into the back of the car.
In the accident, three people in the car and six in the van were slightly injured.
Several ambulances took her to a nearby hospital.
North Korea closes border city after Corona suspicion
North Korea has so far seen a "glowing success" in its own measures to fight the coronavirus.
The country is now reporting a suspected case for the first time.
Because of a first official Corona suspicion in the country, North Korea has completely sealed off a major city for fear of a catastrophe.
Despite the most stringent epidemiological measures in the past six months, "the evil virus could have been introduced into the country," state media reported.
A state of emergency was declared for the region around the border town of Kaesong.
The Communist leadership raised the highest alarm.
If confirmed, it would be the first official case of Sars-CoV-2 infection in the isolated country.
According to North Korea, it had not yet registered a single infection and described its defence measures as a "glowing success".
The information was questioned abroad.
Symptoms of the disease were reported to have been observed in an "outlaw" who illegally crossed the military demarcation line between South and North Korea on 19 July.
The person left for South Korea three years ago and has now returned across the border.
There was initially no confirmation from South Korea of the border crossing within the four kilometers wide and largely still mined military buffer zone.
South Korea's military, however, admitted to the possibility of an illegal border crossing to North Korea as high according to reports of the national news agency Yonhap.
There have been investigations into a number of individuals.
North Korea reportedly called an emergency meeting of the Labour Party's political bureau chaired by Kim Jong Un on Saturday over the suspicion.
The "dangerous situation in Kaesong could trigger a deadly and destructive catastrophe."
Kim had already ordered on Friday, as a preventive measure, "to completely blockade Kaesong and isolate each district and region from others," it said.
The person concerned, as well as all people in Kaesong who had had contact with her, had been placed under quarantine.
The party's central military commission should investigate the "fallout" as well as the conduct of the responsible military unit and, if necessary, impose severe punishment.
Kaesong is home to an estimated 300,000 people.
Tension ahead of the Council meeting: City-East and noise protection still to be discussed before the summer break
"In addition to environmental issues, the committee members will also vote on the development plan for the large-scale urban development project East," reads the middle part of the city's press release on the next meeting of the municipal council on Tuesday, July 28, at 4.30 p.m. in the large hall of the CongressCentrum Pforzheim.
In particular, the upgrading of the eastern city is controversially discussed until the end.
The majorities for it are scarce, most recently in individual committees even negative, depending on the attendance.
An appeal from the economy (construction, real estate, trade and IT), the project developed out of the citizenship and then by the administration and municipal council not to let now fail after almost ten years of preparation, criticized project opponents Reinhard Klein as "extra-parliamentary opposition", "unsuspecting", "speculation", " vilification" and "conscious falsehoods".
"Everyone thinks they know better," says Klein, who has been a member of the municipal council for a year as the only representative of the Pforzheim citizens' list.
In fact, after reading the Treaties, he is in this position: "I know what I'm talking about".
The exit is cheaper for the city, the Technical Town Hall is to be renovated for 8.5 million euros, contrary to statements by the city administration after subsidies, of whose existence Klein is convinced.
The city will develop quite differently than predicted in the town hall and by the supporters from the economy.
Shaping the city by one's own strength and not an investor: that was his plan B. One day after Klein, the FDP/FW/UB/LED Group, which also rejects the project, presented an alternative concept.
It also essentially provides for the renovation of the Technical Town Hall, the disclosure of the Schlossberg, the leasing of the ex-Thales for administrative space and a smaller-scale downtown redevelopment, ideally with local sponsors.
Environmental issues play a central role
In addition, environmental issues will play a central role.
Among other things, the municipal council will vote on the noise action plan.
This includes various measures to protect the population of Pforzheim from health-related noise pollution caused by road traffic, often including speed reductions.
In a press release, the local Verkehrsclub Deutschland welcomes the widespread introduction of speed 30. However, the political leaders in the city are not innocent of the fact that this has to happen, because they have only contributed to the massive increase in car traffic and thus noise by neglecting scheduled buses with thin cycle times and by little commitment to cycling, according to the VCD.
The municipal council also votes on the participation of the city of the energy and climate protection agency Pforzheim/Enzkreis.
In addition, the agenda includes the accession to the climate protection pact of the state of Baden-Württemberg, the redefinition of parental contributions in urban children's daycare facilities and the application for admission to the federal smart city funding.
Citizens are welcome, but must take Corona protection measures into account.
Tim Zimmermann starts the new season with a lot of delay
Tim Zimmermann will start his first season at the ADAC GT Masters on 31 July, almost half a year late.
Before the league of super sports cars can take up regular operation, the first test drives were now on.
For Zimmermann, it was all about getting to know his Lamborghini Huracan GT3 better.
For a long time, the Corona crisis has prevented Tim Zimmermann from starting his first professional race in Grasser Racing’s new Lamborghini Huracan.
Under special hygienic conditions this was now possible.
The 23-year-old Langenargener made his first laps at the Lausitzring and was able to get used to his premiere in a GT3 car.
"There are already a few things that are different from the pre-season Porsche," says Zimmermann.
"With the ABS, for example, you have to go into the curves differently.
But it was really a lot of fun."
Zimmermann also had fun with Steijn Schothorst, with whom he will share his orange sports car in the GT Masters.
The Dutchman is already experienced in GT sport despite his only 25 years and was able to help his new teammate in many things.
"I'm not a beginner in motorsport, but every new series brings with it new challenges," Zimmermann says.
"Steijn and I understand each other brilliantly and we have also made enormous progress from session to session at the Lausitzring."
Exactly there - at the Lausitzring - the GT Masters will also hold its first race.
From 31 July, the 33 super sports cars will race through Lausitz.
But Zimmermann, who is one of 15 newcomers to the series, knows the route.
In 2015 he was the last guest at the Motodrom.
"It worked quickly and I had to get used to the track a little," says Zimmermann, who starts for the Friedrichshafen racing community Graf Zeppelin.
"The Lausitzring has a lot of fast passages that you have to hit optimally to be fast."
How fast the carpenter is then really, that turns out in two weeks.
"The teams play a little poker during the tests, of course," he says.
"In the end, however, we are very satisfied and look forward to the first weekend at the Lausitzring."
The race in Brandenburg will be the start of a busy calendar.
There will be seven races until the beginning of November.
Current state is that no spectators will be allowed - but there is a prominent guest.
In mid-August at the Nürburgring, former Formula One driver Niko Hülkenberg will take over the GT steering wheel.
British Transport Minister caught cold by quarantine decision
The British government's decision to quarantine Spanish holidaymakers for two weeks after their return has caught the country's Transport Minister cold, according to press reports.
According to this, Grant Shapps is currently on holiday in Spain, of all places, while his colleagues decided on the measure at home on Saturday.
Due to rising Corona figures in Spain, the Cabinet in London removed the country from the list of countries from which entry is possible without quarantine requirements.
The new rule applies from today, Sunday, so Shapps will also have to quarantine after his return.
In Austria, the government has also imposed quarantine measures on returnees.
But the regulation applies to those who are on holiday just before the deadline, only from Saturday, 1 August, and was not introduced overnight.
By the way, Spain is still regarded in Austria as one of the "safe countries" for which no quarantine is required in Austria.
"Many ministers may have known in advance that there is a possibility of quarantine being imposed on holidaymakers in Spain," commented Labour MEP Diane Abbot.
"But apparently no one has bothered to tell Grant Shapp's story."
Nearly a month after the end of the Corona emergency in Spain and the expiry of the strict curfew, the number of infections in the country is rising again.
Virologists blame the nightlife in particular for the re-emergence of the virus.
Spain is one of the favourite holiday destinations of the British.
The British Government is currently discouraging unnecessary travel to the Spanish mainland, with the exception of the Canary Islands and Balearic Islands, which are particularly popular with British holidaymakers.
To date, more than 272,000 infections with the novel coronavirus have been recorded in Spain and more than 28,000 deaths.
Russia: Navy Day: Putin announces hypersonic weapons for warships
On Navy Day, Russian President Vladimir Putin has announced that his country will equip warships with state-of-the-art hypersonic weapons.
These weapons, unique in the world, would expand the combat capabilities of the Russian navy, Putin said at the central naval parade in St. Petersburg on Sunday.
According to Interfax, the Ministry of Defence also reported on successful tests of the Zirkon hypersonic rocket, which was built for the Navy.
The hypersonic weapons have a multiple of the speed of sound of about 343 meters per second.
They are regarded as weapons of the future.
Underwater tropedeo continues to be built
It was also built on the nuclear-powered submarine Poseidon.
The planned naval drone is designed to destroy coastal targets.
The president, who himself also sailed a military boat, said that this year alone 40 new ships would be put into service with the individual fleet associations of the largest country in the world.
Russia has such a large coastal area as no other country in the world.
For 300 years, the navy has been reliably protecting Russia, Putin said at the day celebrated by sailors across the country.
The Navy also held parades on many other Russian coastal locations.
In Syria, where Russia is fighting alongside ruler Bashar al-Assad, the military demonstrated its strength at an arms show in the Mediterranean port of Tartu.
Ammunition was also fired.
A video released by the Ministry of Defence showed not only warships, including a submarine, but also combat helicopters and jets.
Hurricane "Hanna" reaches Texas: Corona complicates relief efforts
Washington - The first hurricane of this year's season across the Atlantic landed in Texas.
Life-threatening flooding, strong winds and heavy rainfall now threatened parts of the U.S. state, the National Hurricane Center of the U.S. Climate Agency NOAA reported during the night on Sunday (local time).
Governor Greg Abbott declared a state of emergency for many counties.
The Corona pandemic in Texas complicates the work of the aid workers, Abbott said according to US media.
Evacuees urged to exercise caution
"Each hurricane is an enormous challenge," Abbott said in the Houston Chronicle.
With regard to the Texas cyclone, he added: "This challenge is complicated and is exacerbated by the fact that it sweeps through an area that is the most heavily affected by Covid-19 in the state."
According to the Johns Hopkins University, about 5,000 people have died in Texas alone as a result of the corona pandemic.
Abbott warned people who had to leave their homes to be careful.
They should not disregard practices "to which we have become accustomed", such as wearing masks, the governor said according to CBS.
It is important that everyone keeps a distance.
Therefore, hotel rooms were also provided in some places.
In addition, Corona should be tested in emergency shelters.
Damage was initially reported only from the coastal town of Port Mansfield.
Storm warning withdrawn again
At wind speeds of up to 150 kilometres per hour, "Hanna" was reportedly hit on land on Padre Island just off the Texas coast.
The storm was previously classified as a Category 1 hurricane.
A storm surge warning was initially issued for the coastal section from Port Mansfield to Sargent and was later withdrawn.
Authorities expected a weakening as "Hanna" continued to move inland and headed for northeastern Mexico.
"Douglas" moves to Hawaii
In the Pacific Ocean, Hurricane "Douglas" was heading towards Hawaii at wind speeds of around 150 kilometers per hour overnight.
However, the hurricane center expected it to weaken further.
It is forecast to be near the largest islands of Hawaii on Sunday (local time) - then as a storm just below the hurricane threshold.
Across the Atlantic, NOAA predicted an above-average active hurricane season this year, based on a May forecast.
From June to the end of November, up to ten hurricanes could be expected, of which up to six could be very strong cyclones, the authority had explained.
On average, there are six hurricanes per year across the Atlantic, three of which develop into major storms.
Given the available climate data and the higher water temperatures in the Atlantic and the Caribbean, the probability of a normal season was only 30 percent, and that of a sub-average even only 10 percent, it was said at the time.
U.S. President Donald Trump wrote on Twitter that his administration was closely monitoring the storms and was in contact with the affected states.
Four goals conceded: Video assistant "punished" Sassuolo
Sassuolo's Filip Djuricic were denied two goals
Naples - Four goals scored, four goals conceded: Sassuolo Calcio experienced a raven-black evening at 0:2 (0:1) at SSC Naples in the Italian Football League Serie A - and was really mad at the video assistants of the referee.
"A festival of unfinished business for Sassuolo.
Never before has the VAR acted so hard against a team", commented the "Corriere dello Sport".
Hosts Naples were led by a goal from outsider Elseid Hisaj in the 8th minute, in the 32nd minute Filip Djuricic initially applauded the compensation.
The video assistant referee (VAR) withdrew the shot due to an offside position.
Five minutes later Djuricic shot the ball into the net again - again the VAR attacked.
The goals of attackers Francesco Caputo (50th) and Domenico Berardi (61st) were also taken back by the referee's team after the VAR notice.
In the post-match period Allan made the 2–0 final score for Naples and the bitter evening for Sassuolo perfect.
"The VAR is worse for Sassuolo than a radar trap on the road and punishes Sassuolo like no team before.
The new technology sets records," writes the Gazzetta dello Sport.
FC Bayern Munich: Pavard injured
Munich (dpa) - The start into the hot preparation phase for the Champions League began for double winner FC Bayern with a setback.
Hansi Flick, who recovered "somewhat well" after a short holiday and a few days of training, has to think about how he can rebuild his successful defense after the injury of world champion Benjamin Pavard after the first team training.
The Frenchman, who has the third-most minutes behind captain Manuel Neuer and midfielder Joshua Kimmich, suffered a ligament injury to the left foot root and is threatened to be missing in decisive royal-class duels.
In Munich's muddy weather, the right-handed defender broke off a training game and was driven off the course with a golf card.
How long the unrestricted regular player has to pause in the fight for the title is open.
A place in the eighth-final replay against Chelsea on 8 August is likely to be difficult, and the 24-year-old can hope for the final tournament starting on 12 August in Lisbon.
The Bavarians do not want to be stopped by the misfortune from the training on Sunday.
In his personal triple formula, Flick named the three attributes he wants to see from his stars on their way to Portugal's capital.
Quality, intensity and concentration should show his winning title collectors in the ideally following 28 days until the final game of the King's Class on 23 August.
"We have simply mastered the obligatory tasks with championship and cup excellently.
Now it's time to create something special," said Flick.
Until the Munich players can deal with the final tournament and a training camp in the Algarve in concrete terms, however, the eighth-final obligation against Chelsea is at hand.
After the 3–0 win in the opening game before the Corona break, the Londoners should not become Bayern's dream again in the home arena, as they did in the lost "Finale dahoam" in 2012.
"We have to go through the door first.
We want to win, create good conditions and build confidence with a good game," Flick demanded.
A match-fixing test is scheduled for Friday against Olympique Marseille.
With a long speech, Flick had sworn in his stars, who had 13 days off after the double, for a unique August.
He welcomed 31 players to Säbener Straße, including the new players around Edel-Einkauf Leroy Sané, who for the first time after his move from Manchester City met all his new colleagues on the pitch.
"Leroy has fitted in as well as all the new ones," Flick reported.
But instead of talking about the new season, when Sané & Co. are no longer allowed to just mediate, Flick preferred to talk about the current title project of the German series champion.
After days of individual and small group training, team strength is now being trained for the Londoners, who, unlike the Flick-Ensemble, are in the game rhythm.
After that, Munich could face FC Barcelona and Lionel Messi in the quarter-finals, while Real Madrid, Manchester City or Juventus Turin could face them in the semi-finals.
A way to the final in Lisbon "is not quite so easy", stressed the head coach, who from Tuesday on can rely on the services of his new assistant Miroslav Klose in training.
The World Cup-record goalkeeper Klose and Flick know of so many common tournament preparations, what matters especially in the 0-to-100 match.
With his current team, working is "a pleasure", Flick praised.
The "focus on winning" is an impressive trait of his team.
The tournament with nine teams was also ambitious on Sunday.
All of the champions were present, including Thiago and defender David Alaba, who is uncertain of his whereabouts beyond the King's Class season.
Formula 1 needs a special rule to honor its world champion
Since it is not possible to drive on the required number of continents, the FIA has to improvise in order to award the World Championship titles.
All American races were cancelled.
Racing calendar is becoming more and more concrete
The racing calendar of the current Formula 1 season continues to take shape.
To the ten confirmed Grand Prix so far, three more race tracks were added during the week.
In October, the race will be held at the Nürburgring in Germany and in Portimão, Portugal.
On the first of November, Lewis Hamilton and Co. will compete for World Championship points at the Italian traditional circuit in Imola.
As of today, the race calendar for 2020 comprises 13 races.
"We are pleased that we are continuing to make great progress in completing our plans for the 2020 season," said Formula One boss Chase Carey.
A total of 15 to 18 races will be held in this exceptional season in the premier class of motorsport.
Formula One wants to conclude its season in Asia.
The final race calendar is to be fixed and published in the coming weeks.
Prior to the already officially scheduled races in Bahrain and Abu Dhabi in December, media reports indicate that there could be further appearances in Vietnam and Malaysia at the end of November.
Regulations require races on three continents
However, the Formula One regulations require at least three continental races for the World Championship to be awarded.
Even if, as currently planned, only two continents will be driven, there is to be a world champion.
With the help of a special rule, the FIA wants to award the titles on the basis of "exceptional circumstances" due to the coronavirus pandemic.
The traditional start of the season in Australia in March had to be cancelled at short notice due to the Corona crisis.
A return to the continent this year is not an issue.
Furthermore, Formula 1 will not be a guest in America this year.
Cancellation meets with criticism in Brazil
Due to the tense Corona situation, the races will not take place in Canada, the USA, Mexico and Brazil.
"We look forward to being with them again next season," said Carey.
The cancellation of the Americas races was particularly criticized in Brazil: "The cancellation was not surprising for us, but the reasons for it we can not accept", said Tamas Rohonyi, promoter of the Grand Prix in São Paulo.
For example, the number of infections in the São Paulo area is significantly lower than in other regions of Brazil.
The concerns of some teams not wanting to ride in Brazil would also not justify a cancellation.
We are prepared for the required security measures.
Greta Thunberg: A bad look at Donald Trump went around the world
Greta Thunberg talked about her meeting with US President Donald Trump.
Greta Thunberg was a guest on Stephen Colbert's Latenight Show and revealed in an interview what she had in mind when she met Donald Trump.
Climate scientist Greta Thunberg was a guest on a popular US late night show via video tap.
Among other things, she talked about her fight against the powerful of the world.
The teenager also talked about her famous "bad look" when she met Donald Trump.
New York City - In the past two years, climate activist Greta Thunberg has drawn attention to herself with her tireless commitment to the "Fridays For Future" movement.
Now she talked in a well-known late-night show about her plans for the future as well as her meeting with US President Donald Trump at the UN climate summit last year.
Latenight host Stephen Colbert welcomed the 17-year-old Thunberg on Tuesday in your show and conducted a longer interview with the Swedish.
She spoke not only about her fight against climate change, but also about her conflict with the world's powerful.
"There are some things that surprised me," she said.
"How far people are going to steer the focus away from the climate crisis," she said.
"Everything from organized hate campaigns to threats just because a group of children goes on the streets," she said.
Heads of state and leaders who mock her on social media or even try to silence her find her "funny" because they show her the reactions "because they have no other answer to it".
It became particularly interesting at the end of the interview, when Greta Thunberg was addressed to a well-known scene in which she threw US President Trump a bitterly evil look behind her.
At the 2019 UN Climate Summit in New York, for which the activist sailed across the Atlantic, her expressive gaze was captured by the cameras and has since been seen by countless people on the Internet.
The short clip produced a GIF, an animated image, which ultimately became one of the most commonly used images for Trump opponents.
But what did the 17-year-old think about the US President at that moment?
To Stephen Colbert's relatively open-ended question, she answered only briefly and dryly: "To be honest, I don't think there's any need for further explanation."
The experienced satirist Colbert probably did not expect the decisive answer and disappeared from the picture with a short laugh.
With her "How dare you?" speech about the principles of climate protection, she was remembered by many at the climate conference.
Ex-Dortmunder Immobile with three-pack for Lazio Rome
Ciro Immobile is now on top of Bayern's Robert Lewandowski in the race for Europe's Golden Shoe.
The former Dortmunder Ciro Immobile continues to have the best chances of becoming goalkeeper champion in the Italian football championship.
The former BVB-Profi contributed three goals in the 5:1 (1:1) victory of Lazio Rome at Hellas Verona, including two converted penalty kicks in the postseason of both halves.
The 30-year-old now has 34 goals on his plate from the fourth-place finish two seasons ago - just as many as Robert Lewandowski of FC Bayern Munich scored in the past Bundesliga season.
In Italy Cristiano Ronaldo follows with 30 goals so far, the Portuguese superstar met with the leader in the evening still on Sampdoria Genoa.
Fleetwood Mac co-founder Peter Green died
His life was like a rollercoaster ride: after a rapid ascent with Fleetwood Mac it went steeply downhill and then slowly up again.
Now blues rock guitarist Peter Green has died at the age of 73.
Genius guitarist, drug junkie, cult follower: The co-founder of the band Fleetwood Mac, Peter Green, is dead.
He died peacefully in his sleep at the age of 73, family members said in an official statement on Saturday, another statement would be announced for the next few days.
Top musicians such as Peter Frampton praised Green as one of the best blues and rock guitarists.
Mick Fleetwood spoke in an emotional reaction of a "monumental loss" for all former and current members of the band Fleetwood Mac.
Drummer Fleetwood and guitarist Green had founded the now long-legendary band in London in 1967, and his dreamy instrumental hit "Albatross" is still unforgettable today.
The musician's life ("The End Of The Game", "In The Skies") was like a roller coaster ride.
With Fleetwood Mac Green experienced a rapid rise - the band celebrated its greatest successes but then without him.
Among other things, it is said that there was a dispute because Green wanted to donate all of the group's profits to charity.
He began to appear in wide robes and with a large crucifix.
Psychological problems also played a role.
Three years after the band's founding, Green left the band in 1970.
This was followed by a social decline.
The blues rock guitarist suffered from drug abuse and schizophrenia, as biographers reported.
Green was treated in psychiatry for a long time.
During most of the 1970s, the musician disappeared from the scene.
He is said to have lived temporarily on the streets, worked as a cemetery gardener, and spent time in an Israeli kibbutz.
Green was born in 1946 to a Jewish working-class family in Bethnal Green, London.
At a young age, he became interested in American blues musicians such as B.B. King and Muddy Waters.
At the age of eleven, he learned his first guitar.
At the age of 15, the teenager began to play professional guitar and five years later got the chance to be on stage as lead guitarist for the instrumental band Peter B's Looners.
Shortly thereafter, he was hired by the Bluesbreakers as a replacement for his idol Eric Clapton.
In the midst of the blues boom, Green founded Fleetwood Mac in the summer of 1967, along with fellow Bluesbreakers Mick Fleetwood and John McVie.
The song "Albatross", composed by Green, gave the group their first number one hit in the winter of 1968/69 and catapulted them to the top of the British music scene.
But the rapid rise soon showed its downsides: Green could not cope with the media hype, his experiments with the drug LSD became more and more extreme.
He later commented on the life between music and addiction in an interview: "The worst thing that's happened to me in my life is drugs - the best thing was to land a number one hit".
Towards the end of the decade, Green surprisingly achieved a cult success with an album inspired by religious themes in 1979.
Meanwhile Fleetwood Mac floated without him in a new formation on a wave of success.
Their 1977 album "Rumours" sold more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Despite several minor solo successes, Green did not make a major comeback until 1996, when he rejoined a group of fellow musicians.
The British "Daily Telegraph" then spoke of a rock star who had returned to Earth.
Green released several albums with the Peter Green Splinter Group until the band broke up in 2004.
For music experts he was already a blues legend during his lifetime - and with his gentle sound one of the most influential guitarists of the past decades.
