Biker reacts in a flash and prevents worse
On Friday evening, a traffic accident occurred on the country road between Machtolsheim and Merklingen, in which a motorcyclist was only slightly injured thanks to his quick reaction.
Motorist overlooks biker
A 44-year-old driver wanted to turn left onto Landesstraße 1230 towards Machtolsheim with her VW coming from Merklingen at around 9.30 p.m.
He was a 24-year-old motorcyclist who was driving in the direction of Nellingen.
Hand and foot brake levers fly away in the collision
The biker tried to avoid the car, but still hit it at the rear of the vehicle.
The brake levers were removed from the Suzuki and the driver was unable to brake.
Mindful, he steered his motorcycle into the green strips next to the road and let it roll out without falling.
Biker suffers leg injury
However, the biker suffered an injury to his leg and had to be treated in a hospital.
Mamming: Corona mass infection: 174 harvester infected
After a corona mass infection on a large vegetable farm in Mamming, Lower Bavaria, nearly 500 people are under quarantine and are no longer allowed to leave the farm.
A security service monitors the ban.
A total of 174 harvester assistants were tested positive for the Corona pathogen Sars-CoV-2 during the series test, as the Landratsamt Dingolfing-Landau reported on Saturday evening.
"Unfortunately, in order to avoid further spread, we must take this step to protect the population," stated Werner Bumeder (CSU), the county councillor.
Seven employees had already been infected in the plant - this was the reason for the series test.
The farm is a large vegetable garden growing strawberries, cucumbers, cabbage and red beetroot - but the cucumbers are only for jars.
Mamming is a rural community with a population of 3300, not far from Dingolfing with its large BMW factory.
Bumeder appealed to the citizens to remain calm: "According to our information, this is a closed circle of people".
Infected workers were separated from uninfected workers in the yard, and the site is now surrounded by a barrier fence.
The Greens and SPD gave the state government a share of the responsibility.
The two opposition parties accused Prime Minister Markus Söder (CSU) and his cabinet of neglecting to control the accommodation of seasonal workers.
"This can take a bitter revenge if such local infections occur and regional lockdowns have to be ordered," said Jürgen Mistol, the parliamentary managing director of the Greens.
The SPD sees this very similarly: "After the Corona outbreak in the Wiesenhof slaughterhouse in mid-May, we already demanded a special control programme for farms with harvest workers," said environmental expert Florian von Brunn.
"In our view, it is particularly the hygiene conditions at the workplace and housing conditions that need to be strictly controlled.
Obviously, that has not happened."
The outbreak had come "with announcement".
Aidenbachstraße U-Bahn station: Dangerous dispute: 19-year-old falls into the rail bed after Schubser
During a fight between two youth groups at the Aidenbachstraße underground station, a 19-year-old fell down by a pusher and slipped into the trackbed.
Obersendling - On Friday, at about 4.15 pm, there was a dispute between two youth groups at the Aidenbachstraße underground station.
A passerby alerted the police, who approached with several stripes.
According to the first investigation, a Munich man (17) pushed a 19-year-old to the ground.
The young man slipped over the edge of the platform and fell into the track bed.
Persons from the group of the 17-year-old helped the battered man to climb out of the track.
There was no danger from a railway.
The police reported that there were subsequent clashes between the two men.
The 17-year-old fled the scene, but his personalities could be traced afterwards.
He was accompanied by his father to the police station on 29 April.
The 17-year-old is being investigated for assault.
Report: Seehofer urges longer data storage
Data storage is currently suspended.
According to a media report, however, Federal Minister of the Interior Horst Seehofer is calling for an extension of the storage period.
He wants to strengthen the fight against child abuse.
Federal Minister of the Interior Horst Seehofer (CSU) demands an extended data retention period - instead of the planned ten weeks, half a year.
As reported by the "Bild am Sonntag", Seehofer Justice Minister Christine Lambrecht (SPD) asked for a quick change in the law in a letter.
Seehofer therefore wants to strengthen the measures against child abuse.
He believes it makes sense to "make urgently needed changes to the law now", the newspaper quotes from the letter.
Currently, the data storage is suspended.
A decision of the ECJ is expected.
Seehofer, however, wants the changes to be made beforehand so that they can be applied immediately after a possible positive verdict, the report continues.
A spokesman for the Ministry of Justice told the newspaper that it would only be useful to examine whether legal changes were needed once the courts had ruled.
In the fight against child abuse and child pornography, Seehofer had already spoken out in June in favour of data retention together with the interior ministers of the countries.
NBA: Strip club announcer for Clippers star Lou Williams
Excitement in the NBA!
Lou Williams (33), basketball professional of the Los Angeles Clippers, is said to have left the tournament quarter in Disney World in Orlando/Florida with permission for a funeral.
According to US media reports, he visited the Stripclub "Magic City" in Atlanta in the evening.
Williams, who according to ESPN admitted the visit, is back in Isloation, is tested daily on Covid-19.
His reason for visiting: Chicken Wings.
In February last year, "Sweet Lou", as he is called in the NBA, already expressed his love for precisely these wings.
The American wrote: "Magic City and Blue Flame (another strip club in Atlanta, NJ) have the best wings in town."
NBA insider Shams Charania announced on Twitter on Sunday that the NBA Williams has ordered a ten-day quarantine.
The Clippers star missed the first two official games after the test game phase.
The NBA is currently playing the Corona season in Disney World.
The top 22 teams are currently preparing for the season finale, which starts on Friday night.
Söder expresses himself after mass infection to the corona-position
Munich - Health Minister Melanie Huml (CSU) has already announced a tecnological campaign for large farms on Sunday.
The press conference will be shown live on our homepage.
The Mamming case in Dingolfing-Landau has alarmed authorities and politicians.
Almost 500 harvesters from several countries are currently working on the large vegetable farm, over a third of them have been infected with the Corona pathogen.
The farm is now under quarantine and is fenced off with a fence.
No one is allowed to leave the premises, food is delivered.
The authorities are now offering Corona tests free of charge to the community's 3300 residents.
Since the harvesters had little contact with the local population, the Landratsamt assumes that the infections did not spread beyond the farm.
"Bits of Conscience": Confession of the alleged arsonist of Nantes
"My client has shown cooperation," lawyer Quentin Chabert told the newspaper.
The defender added, "He regrets the deeds very much, the confession was a liberation for him."
His mandate was " plagued by pangs of conscience and very much affected by the extent of the destruction".
If convicted, the man faces a ten-year prison sentence and a fine of €150,000, according to the prosecutor's office.
The Gothic St. Peter and Paul Cathedral in Nantes was badly damaged by a fire on Saturday night last week.
The fire broke out in three far-off places in the church.
Laboratory investigations confirmed the suspicion of arson.
The suspect was arrested a few hours after the fire.
He was released a day later.
The man works as a volunteer for the diocese of Nantes and was responsible for closing the cathedral on the eve of the fire.
Since there was no evidence of a violent invasion of the church, he quickly came into the spotlight of the investigators.
Discuss the abolition of the 50+1 rule
Former DFB President Reinhard Grindel has recommended that we think about abolishing the 50+1 rule.
"German football should at least discuss, set conditions and clear rules for investors before the EU Commission creates complete facts," Grindel told Bild am Sonntag.
He stressed: "For the clubs that can most likely become dangerous Bayern and Dortmund, the 50+1 rules do not work anyway: see Leipzig or Leverkusen.
In this respect, one cannot avoid the debate as to whether it is not advisable to facilitate the involvement of investors in associations that want to break into this phalanx."
He has doubts, however, whether there is a willingness in the German Football League to allow majority ownership, which is prohibited in the Bundesliga by the 50+1 rule.
"It remains a legal risk to pull investment fences around the business location Bundesliga in a European internal market," Grindel said.
The former DFB-Chef sees the danger that "attempts to ensure a more competitive balance in the Bundesliga will only weaken the competitiveness of our top clubs at European level in the end, but will not lead to more tension in the championship".
Even a uniform distribution of TV money will not have a decisive effect.
"FC Bayern has a turnover of 750 million euros, Borussia Dortmund 500 million and RB Leipzig 300 million.
The differences are therefore already immense among the first three clubs alone.
The other 15 clubs have an average budget of 130 million," the 58-year-old explained.
Looking back on the past, Grindel feels betrayed.
"Unfortunately, there have been people who have noticed this mistake and have been running through the press instead of talking to me about it," Grindel said of the adoption of an expensive watch that led to his resignation in April 2019.
"That has already occupied me very much in human terms."
The gift, worth around 11,000 euros, had been received from a Ukrainian official.
"I committed a compliance violation and it was right to draw the consequences," Grindel said.
"I handled the ominous watch gift completely transparently and without suspicion.
Many in the DFB knew about it."
He never "made a secret of the gift," the 58-year-old assured.
"That may be called naive, but at least this form of transparency was the complete opposite of corruption."
"Black Lives Matter": Injured and one dead
Protests against police violence in the United States have intensified again with the deployment of federal police officers in several cities.
On Saturday, clashes broke out between demonstrators and police in various cities.
In Louisville, three people were injured, and 16 people were arrested in Seattle.
In Austin, one person was killed by gunshots while a demonstration was crossing a crossing.
Previously, Portland had seen another clash during protests against racism and police violence.
The security forces, including federal police officers, used tear gas on Saturday night and forcibly dismantled demonstrators.
Hundreds of demonstrators marched through Louisville, Kentucky on Saturday, demanding that those responsible for the death of Breonna Taylor be held accountable.
The 26-year-old student was shot dead in March during a drug raid at her home in Louisville.
The target of the raid was someone else who did not live there at all, and no drugs were found either.
On Saturday, three people were injured when a member of a group calling itself an armed alliance of black Americans fired a shot.
According to NBC, they were taken to hospital.
None of them were in danger of life.
The police set up barricades because there were also protesters from a white militia.
There was no meeting between the two groups.
In Austin, Texas, a person was shot and died during a Black Lives Matter demonstration.
The police said they had arrested a suspect.
She has not yet given any details of the circumstances.
Mayor Steve Adler told the New York Times that he, like many in the city, was "comfortable and dismayed" by what had happened.
In the American metropolis of Seattle, demonstrators also clashed with police on Saturday.
They set fire to a construction vehicle outside a youth prison, and the police used grenades and pepper spray.
According to the Seattle Times, 16 people were arrested for resisting police or for bodily harm.
A courthouse in Oakland, California, was set on fire.
A small group of demonstrators broke windows, fireworks, and blinded police officers with lasers, Oakland Police reported late Saturday night (local time).
The fire was quickly extinguished.
In Aurora, a suburb of Denver, Colorado, a car drove past a crowd demonstrating on a highway.
According to police, one of the demonstrators fired a gun and at least one person was injured and taken to hospital.
In addition, windows were broken in a courthouse and a fire was set, as the police reported.
Investigations were initiated.
Rakoczy in Bad Kissingen: Historical costumes defy Corona
Although the spa town lacked the great sourness, visitors and performers enjoyed the Rakoczy flair of the alternative program.
It was unusual for visitors, performers and organizers: the Rakoczy weekend without the Rakoczy festival.
But: Even if the big party mile in the city center was missing, the crowds and program highlights like Saale burns, Rakoczy Ball or Festzug, many came at their expense with the Corona-compliant alternative program.
"I think we have succeeded in spreading Rakoczy's flair," says curator Sylvie Thormann.
The guests would have welcomed it well.
In principle, one can go back to the beginnings of Rakoczy festival, when only the historical ones were in the focus of the festival.
Pleasant atmosphere
Vesna Konhäuser and her husband have been visiting Bad Kissingen for more than 25 years to attend the Rakoczy Festival.
This is also the case this time in the Corona year.
The couple made it comfortable at Luitpold Casino, watching the historical ones strolling and listening to the Cuban live music at the casino restaurant.
"I find it quite pleasant, too," says Konhäuser.
She misses the crowds that otherwise do not belong to Rakoczy.
But it lacks the usual program highlights, especially Saale burns on Friday evening as well as the historic procession and the closing fireworks on Sunday evening.
"That's a pity.
The weather would have been great this year," she says.
Rakoczy equestrian tournament to be held again
For the actors of the historical spa guests, the alternative program meant partly more work.
For example, Christina Gold, who participates in the festivities in a normal year and can be seen on the coach of the Kurgartencafé.
This year she was walking in costume in the city on Saturdays and Sundays.
"That's more strenuous, otherwise we'll have it easier," she says.
The riding club had less to do, even if individual riders were on the road in the park.
"We very much hope that the riders' squadron will be able to take place again next year," says chairwoman Ulrike Waldhofen.
She announced that after several years of break in 2021, a Rakoczy equestrian tournament will also take place.
28 Corona matches at Spanish Second Division Fuenlabrada
The Spanish football second division club CF Fuenlabrada is sliding deeper and deeper into crisis due to a corona outbreak.
Since the newcomer flew from the vicinity of Madrid to A Coruña on 20 July for a game despite the first Corona goals, a low hit follows the next.
By Sunday, 28 players or team members had been positively tested, one of whom was hospitalized, the club said.
Fuenlabrada, from the city of the same name southwest of Madrid, had until now still the chance to reach the playoffs.
Now even the downgrade to the B-group of the Second League is threatening.
The match against Deportivo La Coruña last Monday was cancelled at the last moment, the public prosecutor's office is investigating a possible offence against public health, the supreme sports authority CSD is considering the forced dismissal of the club.
The players and other team members are in quarantine in a hotel.
"Until the sixth day of quarantine, they have not received a fresh towel or gel," the sports newspaper "AS" wrote.
The photos show players hanging underwear and club clothes in their rooms in the hotel for drying after they apparently had to wash them themselves.
The bed linen was not changed for five days.
Another problem is food.
Neither is it good nor sufficient, wrote "AS".
The club management, however, said they were satisfied with the hotel.
The accusation of deliberately endangering public health was rejected by the club's lawyer, Javier Tebas Llanas.
The son of the president of the Spanish Primera Division, Javier Tebas, stressed that the Corona rules established by the football association had not been violated, as reported by the news agency Europa Press and the sports newspaper "Marca".
Before the flight, there were four infected people until 19 July, but all of them were isolated and did not travel with them.
All players and team members were tested again just before the flight to A Coruña on Monday.
When the team was already in A Coruña, the Corona test was positive for "five or six" other team members.
The game was cancelled 60 minutes before the kickoff, said Tebas Llanas.
Police must catch torn horses at steam chase
Two animals were on the road.
The police led her back to her owner.
On Sunday morning, shortly before 6 a.m., a traffic person informed two free-running horses on the feeder between the junction Donnersdorf/Steinsfeld and the motorway junction Theres.
When the officers arrived, the horses were already between the feeder and the village of Dampfach.
After the horses were able to gain the trust of the officials shortly before Dampfach, they were each allowed to put on a rope carried in a striped wagon.
Cycling pro Tony Martin: career continuation imaginable
Time travel specialist Tony Martin is thinking about a continuation of his career.
Frankfurt/Main - Seven-time World Time Trial Champion Tony Martin can imagine continuing his cycling career.
"I am currently working with the team to determine the framework conditions, how and in what form it could continue," the 35-year-old told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung.
Martin is currently employed by the Dutch team Jumbo-Visma and had considered ending his career after this year before the Corona break.
Negotiations with his team also concern the number of race days, he said.
Or other problems that would plague him as a family father, Martin said.
He had stood up after a fall and the first thought was: "Quickly back on the bike.
Today, as the father of a little daughter, I think: What if?
The cyclist admitted that there are aspects with which he is increasingly struggling.
"But it was good to remember what I do in cycling and how much fun it is for me, based on the Corona time."
The time trial specialist will be back in the race at the Tour de l'Ain (5 to 9 August).
Bavaria: At least four dead on Bavaria’s streets on weekend
The beautiful weather attracts bikers to the streets in many places.
For at least three people, the tour ends deadly with the motorcycle.
An 18-year-old pedestrian also dies.
Schönthal - In the weekend, several people, mostly young people, died in accidents on Bavaria's streets.
An 18-year-old motorcyclist was hit by a car on the reverse lane near Schönthal (Cham district) on Saturday.
The reason why the car was on the opposite track was initially unclear.
In Upper Bavaria, a 22-year-old man collided with a horse-drawn carriage on his carriage on Saturday.
He was downhill at Beilngries, according to the police.
In a left turn he collided with the carriage.
His injuries were so severe that he died at the scene of the accident.
Of the twelve occupants of the carriage, one man was seriously injured and one man slightly injured, police said.
In another fatal accident, an 18-year-old man died in Bad Kötzting, Upper Palatinate.
He had been lying on a street on Sunday night and was overtaken by a 42-year-old driver.
The police suspected that the 18-year-old wanted to sleep.
The driver could not brake in time.
At Schönberg (County of Freyung-Grafenau) a 57-year-old biker collided frontally with a car in a right turn despite a full brake on Saturday.
He died at the scene of the accident.
The 57-year-old driver was shocked, the other three people in the car remained unharmed.
The safety of motorcyclists was the subject of a debate on Saturday by Bavaria's Transport Minister Kerstin Schreyer (CSU).
In a letter to the organiser of the biker protests against driving bans announced for August, Gabor Kovacs, the minister referred to extensive investments such as under-running protection on ladders and the de-escalation of dangerous curves.
"We have achieved a lot in the past years for the safety of motorcyclists," the letter said.
"The number of motorized two-wheelers killed decreased by around 28 percent compared to 2011."
Kovac tests with Monaco against Frankfurt
Frankfurt/Main (dpa) - Football coach Niko Kovac will soon be reunited with Eintracht Frankfurt with his new club AS Monaco.
The eight-time French champion will be playing at the Hessen, the former Club des Croats, on 1 August (18.00 a.m.).
It is the first and only hardship test for the Bundesliga team before the Europa League return match against FC Basel on 6 August.
Due to the coronavirus pandemic, the match is played without spectators.
"We are particularly looking forward to this game.
It's always nice to come to Frankfurt and meet friends," Kovac explained.
Sportingly, this is an interesting test, said the 48-year-old.
Before joining Bayern Munich, Kovac coached the Hesse from 2016 to 2018 and led them to the DFB-Pokal.
"A top-class opponent like Monaco is a good test for us in the game against Basel.
Like all Frankfurters, I look forward to seeing Niko Kovac again," said Eintracht coach Adi Hütter.
The 50-year-old Austrian had succeeded the Croatian at the time of the agreement.
In March, the Frankfurters lost the final against Basel in their own stadium, 3–0.
Nearly 50 new infections: district Hof just past the lockdown
In the district of Hof, the number of known coronary reinfections on the weekends has increased further: from 39 on Friday and 43 on Saturday (one person has recovered and no longer falls into this statistic) to 47 on Sunday.
There is also a case in the town of Hof.
This approaches the critical threshold of 50 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants in a week.
700 deaths due to monsoon rains in Southeast Asia
The severe floods in South-East Asia have affected more than 9 million people, mainly in Bangladesh, India and Nepal.
A total of 700 people were killed due to heavy monsoon rain.
In Bangladesh, the Red Crescent tries to reach the isolated people in boats.
Entire villages are under water.
The farmers have lost their crops.
Panzernashörner in National Park die by landslide
In Kaziranga National Park, several of the 120 Panzernas horns died in an earthquake.
They are protected and considered endangered.
This year, the floods are particularly severe, which scientists attribute to climate change.
Bangladesh is one of the countries most affected by global warming, according to the United Nations.
New apartments are empty
In Cox's Bazar in southern Bangladesh, the state has built housing for 650 people displaced by the floods.
So far, only a few have moved in.
It is difficult to get people to Cox's Bazar.
The enthusiasm is also maintained in Grenezn.
Those who used to have a house, even though it was small and looked like a hut, often do not want to spend their lives in a large block of flats.
Many homes are empty, but the government wants to move in soon from those who have lost their homes to the floods.
60 new corona infections in just one day in Vienna

Argentina rejects counteroffer from creditors
The new requirements could not be met, the Ministry of Economy in Buenos Aires reported on Saturday.
"This would not only be irresponsible, but also unjust," a statement said.
"While 50 percent of children in Argentina live in poverty, we cannot increase the short-term profits of our creditors."
The debt of the second largest economy in South America is no longer sustainable under current conditions.
Argentina is therefore asking its private creditors to forego some of its claims of around 66 billion US dollars (about 59 billion euros).
If no agreement is reached, the country is once again threatened with bankruptcy.
It would be the ninth default in Argentine history.
Most recently, lenders had demanded higher interest rates on government bonds and changes to some contract clauses.
The Argentine government, however, is sticking to its last offer and is not prepared to make any further concessions.
Argentina is in a severe financial and economic crisis.
The inflation rate was more than 50 percent last time.
Experts expect the economic strength to decline by around ten percent this year.
At the end of May, Argentina had defaulted on interest payments of US$503 million, resulting in a limited default.
Professionally arrived - privately not yet
"It's going super well" - this is the conclusion Dr. Stefanie Kramer draws after her first days at the Notary Office in Eggenfelden.
In the end, everything went very quickly: In mid-May, Dr. Stefanie Kramer learned that she will succeed Lutz Feller at the Eggenfelden office.
Six weeks later, in early July, the doctoral lawyer started work, and the normal day-to-day business has long since been running at full speed.
"I have to arrive privately, however," she explains in conversation with the Rottal Anzeiger and laughs.
The short lead time was of course not enough to completely relocate the food hub from Regensburg to Eggenfelden, reports the Dingolfingerin native.
She is currently with her husband, who works as a judge at the regional court in Regensburg, looking for a suitable apartment or house in the city.
At least her husband could still apply for parental leave at short notice in order to be able to provide care for the two daughters (31⁄2 and 11⁄2 years old).
In order not to have to commute from Regensburg every day, she also has an overnight stay with her parents in Dingolfing, the 39-year-old explains.
Growing up in the neighbouring district, she has of course long known the town of Eggenfelden.
During visits to the area with her family in the past months, she has again found out: "Eggenfelden is a really nice little town".
She was all the more pleased that she had competed in the selection process for the vacancy.
Her homeland of Lower Bavaria also plays a central role in Dr. Stefanie Kramer's professional career: After studying law in Passau, she completed her doctoral studies and the 2nd state examination in Regensburg.
After several assignments as a notary, among others in Rehau and Hof in Oberfranken, Babenhausen in the Lower Allgäu and Regensburg - during this time she also "alongside" trained for her doctorate in labour law - she took her first position as a notary in Rotthalmünster in the district of Passau in 2012.
In 2016, she went on parental leave, and was eventually moved to Regensburg.
Since then, she has been working in various offices.
When the job in Eggenfelden was advertised because Lutz Feller was about to retire, she saw the right time for a full professional return, the 39-year-old explains.
The team of her predecessor, who will in future take over the holiday representation in the notary's office, has completely taken over Dr. Stefanie Kramer - and has a compliment for the team of the law firm ready: "It's going super well!"
The fact that she can rely on established procedures here makes it easier for her to deal with the upcoming relocation of the private food supply.
In terms of kindergarten and nativity scenes, she has already made contact with a local institution.
And everything works out as desired, she hopes to be able to pursue her hobby here soon - and to get to know the most beautiful jogging trails of the Rottal.
BVB plans to start the league with a maximum of 15,000 spectators
Dortmund The largest German football stadium in Dortmund will not even be filled to 20 percent at the start of the season in the event of a fan return.
"Due to the distance regulation, which must be complied with, we plan to have between 12,000 and 15,000 spectators according to the current situation," Carsten Cramer, managing director of Borussia Dortmund, told the "Tagesspiegel".
The stadium is usually used for Bundesliga matches with a capacity of just over 81,000 spectators.
In the last season's ghost games caused by the Corona pandemic, BVB lost around four million euros per game.
Cramer, who is responsible for marketing, digitisation and internationalisation at BVB, hopes that, in addition to the normal spectator seats, some of the approximately 4,000 seats in the hospitality area can be opened again: "It is of course a blow to the accounts if these revenues completely collapse."
In view of the ongoing Corona crisis, all are currently "well advised to take a stable side-long first".
"If many companies are not doing well and 6.8 million people in Germany alone are in short-term employment, then the need for entertainment is limited," Cramer explained.
The Dortmund marketing chief praised the BVB professionals for their waiver, which is intended to help overcome the crisis: "Of course, the players know that their waiver has a different effect than if we put 100 people working in merchandising on short-term work."
Tiny miracles: Early start into life with a few hundred grams
Hardly heavier than a packet of butter, just three tablespoons of blood in his entire body: that was Gabriel when he was born - he weighed exactly 273 grams.
The boy is one of about 400 babies that are cared for at the Graz Children's Hospital every year.
A quarter of them weigh less than 1,500 grams, a few - like Gabriel and his brothers Raphael and Michael - are extreme lightweights with less than one kilogram of birth weight.
They are so small and so early in life that neither lungs, intestines, nor muscles are fully developed.
Your skin is sometimes so delicate that it could damage the electrodes of an ECG.
And they are so tiny that they sometimes wear doll's clothing and mini-wheels specially made for them.
But not so small that they were not at voice - "and how", smiles Berndt Urlesberger.
"Even if they don't scream quite as loudly as big babies, of course."
When the whiteboard becomes the stage
Despite Corona Theater in the classroom: The 9th grade of the Sankt-Jakobus-Gymnasium in Abtsgmünd experienced the whiteboard as a stage just before the holidays began.
Actress Julia Sylvester from the Theater der Stadt Aalen presented the production "Das Heimatkleid" to the students - and by video.
Afterwards, the students were able to exchange ideas about the play and the performance with the actress and director Winfried Tobias via Skype.
The idea for the performance format was born out of the current Corona situation.
Teacher Teresa Nar was pleased with the enrichment of the lessons.
Although all participants agreed in the end that the direct encounter in the theatre and stage space would offer additional attractions, one sees the potential for contact in schools in the theatre.
"If we improve the technical framework further, this could be an interesting addition to the game operation," director Winfried Tobias emphasized.
First round draw: TSV 1860 would face Eintracht Frankfurt in the DFB-Pokal
If TSV 1860 qualify for the DFB-Pokal, the Lions will face Eintracht Frankfurt in the first round.
This was the result of the draw on Sunday.
Munich - Sixty possible opponents in the first round of the DFB-Pokal are set.
The Lions would meet Eintracht Frankfurt in a successful qualification.
This was the result of the draw on Sunday evening in the ARD Sports Show.
Because the Corona-Pandemie is not yet complete, placeholders were used in the draw.
The TSV 1860 is already in the final of the Bavarian Toto Cup (September 4 or 5) due to the voluntary surrender of semi-final opponent FC Memmingen.
There the Lions meet either the Würzburg Kickers or Viktoria Aschaffenburg.
If the second-tier reigning Würzburg reached the final, Sixty would already be qualified for the first round of the DFB-Pokal.
Otherwise, the Giesinger would have to prevail in the final against regional league Aschaffenburg.
The first round of the DFB-Pokal will be played between 11 and 14 September, one week before the start of the Third League.
"Breaking the Wind": Film legend Olivia de Havilland is dead
Oscar-winning film legend Olivia de Havilland is dead.
She died on Sunday in Paris at the age of 104 of a natural death, confirmed her spokeswoman of the German Press Agency.
De Havilland was known for her role as Melanie Hamilton in the South American epic "Vom Winde verweht" (1939).
Born in Tokyo to British parents, Olivia de Havilland moved to California as a young child.
The Austrian theatre artist Max Reinhardt discovered the 19-year-old in the role of Hermia in Shakespeare's "Summer Night's Dream".
Warner Brothers signed her to a seven-year contract and brought her out on stage alongside Eroll Flynn.
He made eight films with the band.
In 1946, she won her first Oscar for the lead role in "To Each His Own".
The film was released in Germany under the title "Mutterherz".
Three years later, she won the award for best actress in William Wyler's "The Heiress".
She was also given much recognition as a neurotic eccentric in "The Dark Mirror" and "The Snake Pit".
Daphne du Maurier suggested her in 1952 for the leading role in the film adaptation of her novel "My cousin Rachel".
The play became a worldwide success.
With her long-time friend Bette Davis she played in "Wiegenlied für eine Leiche".
He married the writer Marcus Goodrich (1946–1953) and had a son, Benjamin Goodrich.
In Paris, de Havilland married the journalist Pierre Paul Galante and had a daughter Gisèle with him.
This marriage also broke down.
However, rumors of an affair with former British Prime Minister Edward Heath were never confirmed.
"Road to Timmendorf": Beach volleyball: Thole/Wickler miss the finals at Comeback
The second-placed players Julius Thole and Clemens Wickler missed the finals of the beach volleyball tournament "Road to Timmendorf".
At the meeting of the top teams in Düsseldorf, they lost in the semifinals to their national team colleagues Nils Ehlers and Lars Flüggen with 1:2 (17:21, 21:17, 19:21).
Last time Thole/Wickler played was in September last year at the World Tour Final in Rome.
In the final on the Rhine, their opponents Ehlers/Flüggen lost to Lukas Pfretschner and his interim partner Steven van de Velde, 2–0 (17:21, 17:21).
In addition to the show tournament, three starting places for the German Championships were played at Timmendorfer Strand in early September: Tickets were secured by Armin Dollinger/Simon Kulzer, Manuel Harms/Richard Peemüller and Simon Pfretschner/Milan Sievers.
Kalbitz ejection from AfD confirmed - FDP speaks of "Feigenblatt"
The exclusion of Andreas Kalbitz from the AfD is, in the view of the FDP, only a "face sheet" and does not change the character of the party.
"The AfD is the parliamentary arm of the far-right in Germany.
Andreas Kalbitz is only part of the top of the iceberg of radicals in the AfD," said FDP interior politician Benjamin Strasser to the Berlin-based news agency dpa.
The Federal Arbitration Court of the AfD had confirmed the exclusion of Kalbitz on Saturday in Stuttgart after several hours of negotiations, which the Federal Board had decided by a majority in May.
Kalbitz is the chairman of the AfD Group in the Brandenburg State Parliament.
"If the AfD really were to remove right-wing extremists from their party, functionaries like Björn Höcke and his supporters would have long been excluded," Strasser said.
"However, there is no political will in the AfD to do so, because right-wing extremism is now part of the party."
CSU Secretary-General Markus Blume said similarly: "The fact that Andreas Kalbitz is now excluded says nothing and does not change anything," he told the "Welt am Sonntag".
"It speaks volumes, how many frenetic supporters a right-wing extremist still has in the middle of the AfD."
Blume expects the AfD to fall below 5% in future elections.
"The days of the AfD in parliaments are numbered".
Kalbitz was one of the spokesmen for the now officially dissolved "wing" around the Thuringian AfD Landes- and faction chairman Björn Höcke; the constitutional protection classifies the coronation as "guaranteed right-wing extremist aspiration".
In May, the AfD leadership expelled Kalbitz from the party.
He stated that Kalbitz had not indicated any previous membership in the now banned far-right "Homeland-Faithful German Youth" (HDJ) or in the Republican Party when he joined the party.
"Sweetheart denies membership in the HDJ".
Sebastian Walter, chairman of the left-wing group in the Brandenburg state parliament, also stressed that the Federal Arbitration Court's decision does not change the character of the AfD: "The wolf only ate chalk.
The AfD remains a far-right party, with or without Kalbitz."
This decision does not weaken the Federal Party or the right wing.
"The maneuver of the mutiny troops is transparent.
They want to avoid further observation by the constitutional protection and try to get through under the radar," Walter said.
"The AfD will not let go of the spirits it called.
A ban does not change anything," commented the Brandenburg SPD Secretary General Erik Stohn on the decision in the Kalbitz case.
"Here the AfD-Landesverband and the faction have held to this day to be their rightful leader."
The legal dispute over Kalbitz's membership in the AfD will continue.
On Saturday, the Federal Court of Appeal announced that it would now take civil action against the decision of the Federal Court of Appeal.
North Sea wind farms deliver a good 21 percent more electricity
The wind power plants on the German North Sea have fed 11.51 terawatt hours of electricity into the grid in the first six months of the year.
This is a good 21 percent more than in the same period last year, the grid operator Tennet in Bayreuth reported.
Tennet is responsible for the transmission of the North Sea electricity to the mainland and the transmission through the German electricity grid.
The wind turbines on the Baltic Sea, which are not part of Tennet's grid area, have supplied a further 2.22 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity.
Overall, wind power from the North and Baltic Sea thus comes to 13.73 TWh, compared to a good 11.64 TWh in the first half of 2019.
The wind harvest at sea accounts for almost 19 percent of the total wind power in Germany; that is about four percentage points more than a year ago.
New wind farms provide higher generation capacities
The increased contribution of offshore wind energy is due to higher generation capacities in addition to wind conditions, as new wind farms have been connected to the grid in the past twelve months.
If the 1270 wind farms in the North Sea were all running at full power at the same time, they could generate 6.7 gigawatts of electricity.
The transmission capacity is sufficient for this purpose; according to Tennet, it is 7.1 gigawatts.
By 2030, it is expected to rise to 17 gigawatts in the German North Sea.
"In Germany and the Netherlands, we will invest 20 billion euros in the expansion of offshore network connections by then," said Tennet Managing Director Tim Meyerjürgens.
In reality, wind farms cannot even use up their capacity at sea, but can reach around 40 percent.
The record day so far this year is 2 January, when the North Sea wind farms generated more than six gigawatts of electricity.
On average, the North Sea wind turbines produce about 2.5 to 3.0 gigawatts of electricity, which corresponds to three to four nuclear power plants.
This could supply electricity to almost seven million households.
Art "Skirmish" - an exhibition of the Leipzig artist Christian Bold in the gallery of the Gmünder Kunstverein.
It was almost a small anniversary celebration for the 130th anniversary.
The Gmünder Kunstverein's birthday: The exhibition opening "Skirmish" with works by the Leipzig artist Christian Bold broke the usual framework after the Corona break.
Much more art lovers than usual followed the dialogue between the artist and the chairman of the art association, Professor Dr. Klaus Ripper.
The musical equivalent was provided by the band "Defenders of the Universe" on the southern Kornhausplatz.
North of the gallery the association "Sandtogether" was involved.
Freital: Windbergfest cancelled due to Corona
The Windbergfest will not take place this year.
The city of Freital has cancelled the three-day festival planned for September.
In other years, over 30,000 people had attended this festival.
"We really did not make this decision easy and - aware of how difficult it is for the parties involved - hoped until the last minute", said Mayor Uwe Rumberg (non-partisan).
"But ultimately, as the organisers, we are responsible for the health of many thousands of people."
If tens of thousands of people had flown to the festival grounds and tent, minimum distances, hygiene regulations and contact tracing in accordance with the current Corona Protection Regulation could not have been complied with.
Or the restrictions would have been so strong that there would not have been much left of a folk festival.
Moreover, the organisational and monitoring effort would increase disproportionately by many times.
Rumberg was reluctant to go on to the next year.
Then the city of Freital will celebrate its 100th anniversary with the Winterbergfest from 7 to 9 May 2021 and the Day of Saxony from 10 to 12 September 2021.
Dressage Olympic champion Werth in aisles not to beat
Achleiten - The six-time Olympic champion Isabell Werth was the outstanding rider in the dressage tournament in Achleiten, Austria.
The 51-year-old from Rheinberg came to four victories in four starts at the weekend.
After winning the Grand Prix with Weihegold and Quantaz, she was unable to beat in the Grand Prix Special and in the freestyle on Sunday.
On the 15-year-old mare Weihegold Werth won a clear victory against the Austrian Victoria Max-Theurer on Abegglen on Sunday in the special.
In the freestyle, the German was also ahead of her 34-year-old pupil Victoria Max-Theurer on Quantaz on Saturday.
Werth's winning horse Quantaz belongs to Max-Theurer.
The most successful dressage rider in the world is to establish the ten-year-old stallion in the Grand Prix.
For Quantaz it was the first freestyle ever.
Werth had already won all four important tests at the first tournament in Achleiten three weeks ago.
The last of the three international tournaments is scheduled for 14-16 August.
More air traffic controllers in Worms in the future
Worms University of Applied Sciences goes further in the air: DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung is establishing a professorship for Air Traffic Management.
A corresponding contract between the university and DFS has now been signed in Worms.
The contract was initially for three years and will start in 2021.
The professorship offers the possibility to start studying not only in the summer semester, but also in the winter semester.
This will enable twice as many students to be trained as before.
At the same time, the capacities at both the university and the DFS Air Traffic Control Academy are being used evenly.
The DFS will advise the university on the establishment and appointment of the professorship.
Representative at the university since 2019
Since the summer semester 2019, the first students in their training as air traffic controllers at Worms University of Applied Sciences have been in the Air Traffic Management programme.
Nine students have already started this year.
So far, the experiences of the DFS have been very positive, and the performance of the students is excellent.
The combination of study and pilot training contributes significantly to further increasing the attractiveness of the pilot profession.
"In these times, promoting the industry is not easy for us.
We are confident, however, that air traffic will recover and grow again in the long term.
In order to continue to fulfil our legal mandate in the future, we need highly qualified personnel," said Professor Klaus-Dieter Scheurle, Chairman and CEO of DFS, when signing the contract.
"For DFS, the foundation professorship is a future-proof investment that will provide air traffic controllers with a broad, multidisciplinary knowledge base in the long term.
We are therefore continuing to work well with the university and at the same time underpinning our attractiveness as an employer."
This is also underlined by Professor Dr. Jens Hermsdorf, President of Worms University of Applied Sciences: "The endowed professorship forms an important bridge between science and business.
With her, we would like to build on the already existing cooperation with DFS German Air Traffic Management as a practical partner for the dual Bachelor's degree programme Air Traffic Management."
The trust of German Air Traffic Control is both a motivation and a commitment for the University of Applied Sciences Worms to further develop its teaching and research competence in the future fields of air transport.
With the first endowed professorship for a dual degree programme, the university could set very special highlights and innovative priorities for its students in the field of the air traffic controllers of tomorrow.
Dr Denis Alt, State Secretary at the Ministry of Science, Further Education and Culture, emphasises: "With its focus on air transport, Worms University of Applied Sciences has a unique positioning in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Today's signing of the cooperation agreement strengthens the profile of the university."
Rescue helicopter lands on the A 45
On Saturday afternoon, the A 45 motorway towards Aschaffenburg was closed for about 30 minutes, as the rescue helicopter was in use after a traffic accident.
A 76-year-old driver drove a Ford straight ahead in the curve at the Alzenau-Mitte exit at around 12:40 and landed on the ladder.
The crash caused the front airbags to detonate, causing the driver to suffer minor facial injuries and to be taken to a hospital for treatment.
The injuries of the 72-year-old passenger were attended to by an emergency doctor and the patient was subsequently flown to a hospital by rescue helicopter.
At present, however, the police assume that there is no risk of death.
The damaged vehicle, which caused damage of about 2000 euros, had to be towed away.
Heil wants to examine other industries after meat industry
The Corona crisis brought to light the situation in parts of the meat industry.
Legislative amendments are imminent.
But are they right - and will it stay that way?
Federal Labour Minister Hubertus Heil (SPD) wants to review other sectors in line with the strict regulations against malpractice in the meat industry that are now planned.
"We will look at each sector and then take appropriate measures for the respective sector if necessary," Heil told the German Press Agency in Berlin.
Germany's employers are already warning against restricting work contracts in general.
Following the massive corona outbreak at the meat giant Tönnies in North Rhine-Westphalia, the Federal Cabinet wants to pass a law of salvation this Wednesday.
Large slaughterhouses should no longer be allowed to employ third-party personnel for slaughter, cutting and meat processing.
The use of contract and temporary workers is to be prohibited there.
Employer President Ingo Kramer told the dpa: "Keep away from a general restriction of contracts and transfers of workers if you do not want to completely strangle the economy".
For example, factory contracts are the basis for the creation of value for the customer in large areas of the crafts, construction industry and plant construction.
"The failures of individuals cannot destroy such an important instrument."
Heil assured: "My aim is not to ban works contracts everywhere in the German economy."
Work contracts are useful.
"When an industrial company hires a craftsman to install a safety system, it is a normal contract."
The German meat industry considers a ban on contracts and temporary work in its sector alone to be unconstitutional.
It is not possible to explain why different labour law should apply to the portioning and packaging of cheese than to sausages in the future, according to an opinion on the bill, as reported by the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" (Saturday).
A ban would increase the consumer price by 10 to 20 percent per kilo and product.
According to the results of an examination by the NRW Labour Protection Administration, many Eastern European employees from contractors worked partly 16 hours a day in the industry.
Often they had no break.
Pay was retained for protective equipment or rent.
It was also found that the situation with the accommodation of employees was often miserable.
Heil said that a relatively strict law had already come into force for the meat industry in 2017.
However, these were bypassed by "tricky constructions".
"Now it is essential to clean up."
The politician announced: "In the Occupational Safety Act, which we intend to adopt in the cabinet at the end of July, there are also measures that do not only concern the meat industry - for example, higher inspection rates for occupational safety or clear criteria for communal accommodation".
The draft submitted by the dpa includes amendments to the Law on the Protection of Employees' Rights in the Meat Industry and the Labour Protection Act.
Brandenburg's Consumer Protection Minister Ursula Nonnemacher (Greens) believes that more intensive controls are necessary.
"I would like us to be able to carry out even more controls in many areas of supervision: food controls, animal welfare, everything possible, including animal transport, for example," Nonnemacher said on Sunday in the RBB programme "Brandenburg aktuell".
But more staffing posts are also needed for more controls.
Three people killed in ultralight plane crash in Germany
According to police, three people died in the crash of an ultralight aircraft on a multi-family house in Wesel in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia.
A child was slightly injured.
Two other people were injured in the accident and were rescued, said a spokesman for the Wesel district headquarters.
A parachute was found at the scene of the accident, according to the police.
The "Rhine Post" reported, citing eyewitnesses, that the plane collided with a hot air balloon before the crash.
The house is a single or two-family house.
Further details were not known at first.
Removal of Frankfurt Opera Square proceeded peacefully
A week after the riots in Frankfurt, the evacuation of the Opera Square went peacefully on Sunday night.
At the end of the day, a few dozen people remained on the square, but left before the curfew at 1 a.m.
The police had been on duty since the early evening with numerous officers, and there was a larger police force throughout the city.
For the first time this weekend, a ban on the opera square, which had been the scene of riots a week ago, was imposed from midnight.
Policemen were attacked with bottles from the crowd of people celebrating.
At least five police officers were injured after police intervention, and several police vehicles were damaged.
The night to Saturday was also quiet.
Car collides: Young woman seriously injured in an accident on Bundesstraße 83 near Hofgeismar
A 21-year-old woman suffered serious injuries in an accident between Schöneberg and Hümme on Sunday at around 1.25 p.m.
She was taken to the Kassel Clinic.
The fire department searched for possible passengers with thermal imaging cameras.
According to police, the woman was on the road to her hometown of Hümme on Bundesstraße 83 when her car broke off the road and overshot itself several times for a reason that has not been clarified.
To save the victims, the fire department had to cut the roof of the car.
As it was unclear whether anyone else was in the vehicle, the adjacent corn field was searched by the ladder with a thermal imaging camera.
The Warburg squadron, which also works with thermal imaging cameras, had also been ordered to search for people.
The rescue workers, however, found no one among the tall corn plants.
The seriously injured were taken to the Kassel hospital for further treatment in an ambulance.
Almost 50 firefighters from the Hofgeismar, Hümme and Schöneberg fire departments were on site.
The road was closed for two hours due to the accident.
Juventus Turin Champions in Italy
Turin - After a redeeming goal by Cristiano Ronaldo, Juventus, the record champions of the Italian football league, have secured the title for the ninth time in a row.
The team around the five-time world footballer made the 36th Scudetto of the club's history with a 2-0 (1:0) on Sunday evening in the home game against Sampdoria Genoa perfect.
Ronaldo scored 1–0 before halftime.
With 83 points, Turin, which started without the last long-injured ex-national player Sami Khedira, is no longer out of first place two games before the end of the season of Serie A.
The second place Inter Milan is seven points behind.
Juventus were injured in the first half, but Ronaldo was able to score the last goal after a free kick.
The 35-year-old used a Miralem Pjanic shot from the penalty area with a flat shot (45.+7).
Ronaldo also scored 2–0 against the more offensive side, after Federico Bernardeschi (67th) had a dust.
This was a very successful but unsuccessful attempt.
The goal thrown to the bat in the 89th minute should have been a real surprise to Ronaldo himself, considering the goalkeeper rating.
"It's difficult to stay mentally and physically at the ball for 90 minutes.
The games are strange and the momentum changes very slightly," said coach Maurizio Sarri after the 1:2 win over Udinese Calcio on Thursday.
Especially the mental exhaustion of his players is great, said the Juve coach.
Due to the defeat, the team could not make the championship.
The final victory was due to the weakness of the rivals.
In the eleven games before the game on Sunday, the Sarri team had only managed five victories.
Whether Ronaldo will also become a goalkeeper king is questionable.
After his three-pack in the 5:1 (1:1) of the fourth-placed Lazio Rome against Hellas Verona, former Dortmunder Ciro Immobile has already scored 34 goals, as many as Robert Lewandowski contributed to the title win for FC Bayern.
The record in Italy is held by current Juve-Profi Gonzalo Higuaín.
In the 2015–16 season, he scored 36 goals for SSC Naples.
In August, the next chance for the title awaits the "Old Lady" of Italian football.
Juventus are in the Champions League quarter-finals, but on 7 August they face Olympique Lyon in a 0–1 draw to reach the final in Lisbon.
In the next knockout round, Real Madrid or Manchester City would be waiting as opponents.
Baden-Württemberg: Over 250 illegal car races recorded
Stuttgart - Despite all the threatened penalties and court rulings, drivers continue to give gas in countless illegal races on the Baden-Württemberg roads: In the past year and the first four months of this year, the police in the southwest have already registered more than 250 illegal car races.
There are no comparable figures for the years before, but the racers are increasingly making the judicial authorities work: In 2018, a total of 155 investigations were conducted by the prosecutors' offices between Konstanz and Mannheim on the grounds of illegal races, a year later there were already 252 and in the current year, by the beginning of June, 151.
The races were less about organized events, as the Interior Ministry's reply to a request from the SPD in the Landtag shows.
In most cases, the drivers spontaneously started against each other or they had fled from the police - this is also reported as an illegal race.
The drivers were mostly German men between the ages of 18 and 60.
113 fines - 15 times imprisonment
Only in relatively few cases are the rasers caught and also asked to pay the fine: According to the Interior Ministry, a total of 113 fines have been imposed and 15 prison sentences pronounced since 2018.
There is no evidence that the number of illegal car races is actually increasing.
Rather, other drivers reacted more sensitively than before and showed more often because of the numerous tragic accidents and trials in recent years, said a ministry spokesman.
The highway 8 is particularly popular with racers.Once again, drivers stop the traffic there to make room and use the freeway for a race.
Last August, a dozen drivers were caught near Kirchheim under Teck, three months earlier there were even 18 drivers on the A8 near Merklingen.
A81 is the most popular "race track"
The police even record more races on the A81 than on any other federal motorway.
There, a speed limit is used to try to slow down the lawnmower on the particularly affected section between narrows and gizzards.
The mostly high-priced and mottled sports and luxury cars often have Swiss license plates, because the drivers avoid the lawn to Germany because of the high penalties for driving too fast and car racing in the neighbouring country.
For the SPD, the speed limit must not be reduced to a few stretches: "With a general speed limit of 130 kilometres per hour, we would be able to overcome this problem on motorways," says Martin Rivoir, the transport expert for the SPD parliamentary group.
"The threshold for Raser would be significantly higher if you were not allowed to be legally on the road here and there with 200 kilometres per hour and more."
Rivoir thinks less of education or image campaigns: "Anyone who ignores all the rules in this way and puts not only his own life but also the lives of other road users at risk is hardly attainable with reason."
ADAC calls for stronger police intervention
The ADAC, on the other hand, is not satisfied with this: "We assume that Raser will not be deterred by the speed limits," says Holger Bach, head of the Transport and Environment department at the ADAC Württemberg.
It calls for additional and even tougher controls on the affected routes.
The high-speed power-testing often turns into a painful and serious event: since January 2019 and until April 2020, three people have died in the races nationwide, two of them in an accident in Stuttgart's city centre at night and one in Gerlingen.
There, two young men are said to have raced in November.
One of the vehicles left the road, crashed against a garden wall and lay on the side, the 18-year-old passenger died.
Twenty-one other people were injured in the races of the past two years.
However, in the opinion of Interior Minister Thomas Strobl, tougher penalties are not necessary: "Law-making action to sanction illegal motor racing harder is not seen," the paper of the Interior Ministry says.
Blue light of July 23: Thirsty burglar steals drinks from snack bar
Rohrdorf: A man broke into a snack bar in Rohrdorf (Calw district) on Thursday and stole drinks and cash.
A witness heard noises in the valley road at around 3.40 a.m. and ran towards the snack bar.
There he noticed a man using the fridge with drinks and leaving the snack afterwards through a previously opened entrance door.
The perpetrator fled towards the meadows behind the snack bar.
The burglar also used a cash register and stole cash in the low three-digit range, according to police.
The suspect is described as follows: He is about 1.75 to 1.80 meters tall and of strong stature.
In fact, he was wearing a black hooded sweater, black trousers and light shoes.
The police take further witness statements.
Ackermann sprints to victory on the final stage of Sibiu Tour
Cycling pro Pascal Ackermann has won his second day on the final stage of the 10th Sibiu Tour.
The 26-year-old Palatinate rider from Team Bora-hansgrohe won the mass sprint on the 109-kilometre section with start and finish in Hermannstadt after winning one stage on Saturday.
The season was won by Ackermann.
In the overall ranking, his Austrian teammate Gregor Mühlberger prevailed.
The 26-year-old had decided to compete in mountain time trials this morning and thus took the top spot in the class.
Only 104 riders had entered the final stage in the evening.
No less than 18 starters had fallen victim to the time limit in mountain time trials.
"I am really happy to start the season with a victory," Ackermann said after his success on Saturday.
"The sprint was really hectic," said the 26-year-old.
He simply put on his sprint 300 metres before the finish, "and it worked perfectly too".
According to the rules of the UCI, all participants and their companions were subjected to a corona test six days before the race.
During the entire tour, drivers and supervisors were separated from the organisational team and the media in isolated hygiene booths.
Spectators at the start and finish were not allowed.
Headquarters gave instructions for lay persons to be resuscitated
Düsseldorf - Tragic accident on Sunday afternoon in Düsseldorf-Garath.
In an apartment building, a child (4) was suddenly lying dead in the water while bathing.
The fire department reported that the emergency call was made just before 1:00 p.m.
"A dispatcher immediately gave instructions for the layman's resuscitation," a firefighter spokesman told BILD.
The rescue workers arrived shortly afterwards to resume the recovery efforts.
The child, who was in danger of death, was transported to the university hospital under resuscitation.
Why it crashed is unclear.
The police routinely investigated the accident.
The firefighter: "We assume a tragic accident in the apartment".
Nuremberg: Unauthorised tuning meeting - Police attack, 700 vehicles and around 1100 people
Hundreds of cars and, at times, more than 1,000 people took part in a "tuning meeting" on Saturday night in the parking lot of a furniture store.
The police continued to tighten their control over such events.
A large tuning meeting took place on Saturday evening (25 July 2020) in Nuremberg's South Town.
Several hundred vehicles were involved.
According to the police of Mittelfranken, around 10.30 pm, the Nuremberg traffic police detected an increased number of vehicles in the area of a large parking lot on Ingolstädter Straße.
The police then carried out a number of vehicle checks.
Only recently, the police announced that they would step up their action against so-called autoposers.
Illegal tuning meeting in Nuremberg: Only a small part of the "scene"
The police counted 700 vehicles and about 1100 people at the top, the police said.
However, only a small part of the attendees can be attributed to the "autoposer" and tuning scene.
Apparently, most of the scenes in question followed the police's appeal.
The vehicles and people on the spot were presumably mostly show-goers.
In addition, the majority of those present complied with the applicable infection protection regulations, in particular the observance of the minimum distance and wearing a mouth-to-mouth protection.
The on-site inspections were completed at around 1:00 a.m.
In total, the authorities found that 10 vehicles had undergone such structural changes that the operating licence had expired.
Four of these vehicles had to be secured.
No Car Race
There were no illegal car races.
"The Police Bureau Mittelfranken will continue to keep an eye on the situation and will continue to carry out enhanced control measures, including in connection with the rise of show-loving people," it said.
News5 spoke to Jürgen Schrödinger of the towing company involved: "They all have nice rims, we must not scratch them," said Schrödinger.
Special belts would be used for this.
Also because the cars are wider, the company must be careful not to cause damage.
"The young people should finally get their cars back without any damage."
Employment agency figures: 900 suspected cases of abuse in short-term work
Berlin - The Federal Employment Agency (BA) is investigating around 900 suspected cases of abuse of short-term workers' pay.
"This is extremely little for more than 880,000 companies that have reported short-time work," Daniel Terzenbach, the managing director responsible for operations, told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung.
When, at the beginning of the Corona crisis, a large number of companies suddenly applied for short-term work, BA had to react quickly.
The test usually lasts up to three weeks.
"We didn't have that much time available at this hot stage.
We will look at the final accounts all the more carefully.
There will certainly be more to come.
We are not naive and have a long breath".
The abuse was often reported by the employees or unions concerned.
In addition, use the BA analysis software to detect abuse patterns.
According to Terzenbach, the BA is preparing for a possible bankruptcy in the autumn.
"Will there be significantly more insolvencies than in the previous year?
The assessments differ, but we are preparing for the event and already training our employees in the employment agencies to process applications for insolvency funds."
The figures are still inconspicuous, Terzenbach said.
World Heritage Site in Potsdam: Party in the New Garden dissolved
Potsdam - On Friday evening, about 40 young people celebrated a party in the New Garden.
The meeting was dissolved at 8.48 p.m. by the district drivers of the Prussian Palaces and Gardens Foundation (SPSG), the foundation informed on PNN request.
The young people then left the park.
On Saturday evening, some young people would have played rugby in the New Garden.
The meadow had been cleared by area drivers, SPSG spokesman Frank Kallensee said on Sunday.
Again and again there are illegal celebrations in the parks
In the parks of the Foundation, there are repeatedly accumulations in which the distance and hygiene rules of the Covid-19 Conduct Regulation are not observed.
At the end of June, a celebration with about 300 people took place in the Babelsberg Park, and a week later, about 150 people celebrated in the Neues Garten.
Even without Corona Regulation, parks are closed at nightfall.
Camping on the meadows is prohibited by park regulations, with few exceptions.
The foundation has been complaining for a long time that visitors are leaving more and more waste and destroying protected biotopes.
Meanwhile, illegal park parties in Berlin have reached a different dimension.
In the Hasenheide in the district of Neukölln, 5,000 people celebrated an illegal techno party on the night of Sunday.
The event was cancelled by the police.
Austria: Mass tests after Corona eruption in tourist resort
With hundreds of tests, authorities have responded to a corona outbreak in the popular Upper Austrian tourist resort of St. Wolfgang.
The number of confirmed cases rose to 48, as the Linz state authorities reported.
More than 100 results were still outstanding in the evening.
According to the study, many of the infected are young interns in tourism companies, but at least one holiday guest was tested positive.
Residents, guests and tourists were asked to stay in their accommodations on Saturday evening.
The closing time was set at 11 p.m.
"There are cancellations and cancellations" of bookings, said the head of the Wolfgangsee Tourism Association, Hans Wieser, the dpa.
Guests were also invited to stay early.
St. Wolfgang is the most important tourist resort in Upper Austria, with more than 400,000 overnight stays last year.
In a normal season, about one third of the guests are German.
On Friday, the first infections had become public.
The head of the district authority, Alois Lanz, defended the behavior of the interns who had celebrated in several restaurants and could have been infected there on Saturday.
"We all liked to do that in our youth," he told the Ö1 radio station.
However, two bars were closed on Friday to prevent further infections.
The Tourism Association launched an information campaign to raise awareness among young employees of the dangers of Covid-19.
From Saturday onwards, hundreds of employees, holidaymakers and locals were tested.
In addition, all guests who were in St. Wolfgang from 15 July were contacted.
The outbreak evokes memories of the Austrian ski and party resort of Ischgl in Tyrol, which was a centre of corona spread throughout Europe in the early phase of the pandemic.
In total, more than 1500 people are currently infected with the virus in Austria.
The focus of new infections is on Vienna and Upper Austria.
Premier League: Man United and Chelsea qualify for Champions League
London (dpa) - The English football record champion Manchester United returns to the Champions League after a year absence.
The Red Devils finished third in the Premier League in the final game of the season, beating Leicester City 2–0.
The Foxes have to settle for the Europa League, because Chelsea were still passing by and qualified for the league as the fourth team.
In the fight against the descent Aston Villa were allowed to cheer.
Manchester United were led by Bruno Fernandes in the 71st minute.
After a red card for Leicester City in the post-match period, Jesse Lingard (90.+8) scored the final goal.
Chelsea, in the Champions League quarterfinals opponents of FC Bayern, won thanks to Mason Mount (45.+1) and Olivier Giroud (45.+4) in parallel with 2:0 (2:0) against Wolverhampton Wanderers.
"It means a lot to me," said coach Frank Lampard, who also faced Arsenal in the FA Cup final in his first season as Chelsea coach.
Tottenham Hotspur also benefited from Chelsea's win over Wolverhampton, which was a 1–1 draw at Crystal Palace, but the club was still ahead of the Wolves and finished sixth in the Europa League.
Aston Villa won the long-distance match against Watford and Bournemouth, but were forced to shudder to retain their title at West Ham United.
The late leader of Jack Grealish (84th) immediately outshined Andrej Jarmolenko (85th).
The 1–1 (0–0) was enough, however, because Watford lost 2–3 (1–3) to Arsenal.
The club, which had three coaches in the season, is down after five first-tier years.
He was also a substitute for Bournemouth, who lost to Everton 3–1.
In the end, one point was missing.
Liverpool, who have been the English champions since the end of June, secured a club record with a 3-1 (1:1) victory at Newcastle United.
99 points is the highest score the Reds have ever scored in a football season.
The record in English football was only slightly missed by coach Jürgen Klopp and his team.
Manchester City have a record of 100 points in the 2017/18 season.
After Newcastle's first-minute lead, Virgil van Dijk (38th), Divock Origi (59th) and Sadio Mané (89th) made Liverpool's first appearances on Sunday.
"It was an exceptional season for this wonderful club," van Dijk said after the game, "which should encourage us to defend the title.
It's getting hard."
The Premier League bosses should also be satisfied in the end.
The Coronavirus crisis interrupted football in England from 13 March to 17 June.
In the meantime, there has even been talk of early cancellation or the remaining games being played on neutral ground.
The season ended without any major incidents, though, as in Germany, with no spectators in the stadiums.
Arrests and violence during demonstrations against Netanyahu
Protests in Israel against Prime Minister Netanyahu are getting more and more violent.
During the night, violent clashes broke out.
Israeli police violently assaulted demonstrators in Jerusalem on Sunday night, killing the right-wing leader Benjamin Netanyahu.
Twelve people were arrested for participating in the riots, police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said.
The police used water cannons to disperse the demonstration.
According to media reports, around 6,000 people gathered near Netanyahu's office on Saturday evening.
They protested against unemployment, corruption and Netanyahu's handling of the Corona crisis.
The protesters beat drums, blew horns and called on Netanyahu to resign.
Participants of a counter-demonstration supporting Netanyahu were also arrested, the news site "ynet" reported.
People also demonstrated in many other places in Israel, including in front of the Prime Minister's private villa in the coastal city of Caesarea and in a park in Tel Aviv.
A man was arrested near Tel Aviv on suspicion of spraying pepper spray on demonstrators on the side of the road from a moving car, according to police.
Another man was arrested after a knife attack on a demonstrator in the south of the country.
The demonstrator was slightly injured in the neck.
In Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, there have been several demonstrations against Netanyahu recently.
The demonstrations accompany the corruption process against the head of government.
Netanyahu has also been criticized for his handling of the Corona crisis.
Among other things, he is being held up for premature easing and a lack of preparation for a second corona wave.
The Corona crisis has severely damaged the country's economy.
The unemployment rate was last more than 20 percent.
The number of new infections with coronavirus in Israel has recently risen to ever-higher record levels.
Accident at Ahlen (NRW) - Transporter crashes on car - nine injured - Ruhr area - Bild.de
Ahlen - A collision on Saturday afternoon on the B58 near Ahlen caused nine minor injuries.
A female driver was driving with her two children (3, 5) towards Beckum.
The police: "Probably she had suddenly stopped because she wanted to turn."
The driver of a Mercedes-Transporter behind her must have seen this too late.
He crashed onto the car in the back.
Three people in the car and six in the van were slightly injured.
Several ambulances took her to a nearby hospital.
North Korea closes border city after Corona suspect case
North Korea has so far seen a "glowing success" in its own measures to fight the coronavirus.
Now the country is reporting a suspected case for the first time.
Because of a first official Corona suspicion in the country, North Korea has completely sealed off a major city for fear of a catastrophe.
Despite the most stringent epidemiological measures taken in the past six months, the state media reported that "the evil virus could have been introduced into the country".
The state of emergency was imposed for the region around the border town of Kaesong.
The Communist leadership called the highest alarm.
If confirmed, this would be the first official case of Sars-CoV-2 infection in the isolated country.
North Korea has not yet registered a single infection and described its defence measures as a "glowing success".
The information was questioned abroad.
Symptoms of the disease were reportedly found in a "sniper" who illegally crossed the military demarcation line between South and North Korea on 19 July.
The person had left for South Korea three years ago and had now returned across the border.
The border crossing within the four kilometers wide and mostly still mined military buffer zone was initially not confirmed by South Korea.
South Korea's military, however, has acknowledged the possibility of illegal border crossing to North Korea as high, according to reports by the national news agency Yonhap.
There were investigations into several people.
North Korea reportedly called an emergency meeting of the Workers' Party's political bureau chaired by Kim Jong Un on Saturday over the suspected incident.
The "dangerous situation in Kaesong could trigger a deadly and destructive catastrophe."
Kim had already ordered on Friday, as a preventive measure, "to completely blockade Kaesong and isolate each district and region from others," it said.
The person concerned and all people in Kaesong who had contact with her were placed under quarantine.
The party's central military commission is to investigate the "fallout" and the conduct of the responsible military unit and, if necessary, impose a severe punishment.
It is estimated that about 300,000 people live in Kaesong.
Tension ahead of Council meeting: City East and noise protection still under discussion before the summer break
"In addition to environmental issues, the committee members will also vote on the development plan for the large-scale urban development project East", reads the middle part of the city press release on the next meeting of the municipal council on Tuesday, July 28, at 16.30 in the large hall of the CongressCentrum Pforzheim.
The upgrading of the eastern city is controversial until the end.
The majority for this is scarce, and in some committees it is even negative, depending on the attendance.
An appeal from the economy (construction, real estate, trade and IT), the project developed out of the citizenship and then by the administration and the municipal council now not to let now fail after almost ten years of preparation, criticized project opponents Reinhard Klein as "external parliamentary opposition", "unsuspecting", "speculation", " vilification" and "conscious falsehoods".
"Everyone thinks they know better," says Klein, who has been a member of the municipal council for a year as the only representative of the Pforzheim citizens' list.
In fact, after reading the treaties, he is in this position: "I know what I am talking about".
The city is cheaper to leave, the Technical Town Hall is to be renovated for 8.5 million euros, contrary to statements by the city administration after subsidies, of whose existence Klein is convinced.
The city will develop in a completely different way than predicted in the town hall and by the supporters from the economy.
To shape the city by one's own strength and not an investor: that was his plan B. One day after Klein, the FDP/FW/UB/LED Group, which also rejects the project, presented an alternative concept.
It also essentially provides for the renovation of the Technical Town Hall, the disclosure of the Schlossberg, the lease of the former Thales for administrative space and a smaller-scale downtown redevelopment, ideally with local sponsors.
Environmental issues play a central role
In addition, environmental issues will play a central role.
Among other things, the municipal council will vote on the noise action plan.
This includes various measures to protect the population of Pforzheim from health noise pollution caused by road traffic, including many speed reductions.
In a press release, the local Verkehrsclub Deutschland welcomes the widespread introduction of speed 30. However, the political leaders in the city are not innocent of the fact that this must happen, because they have only contributed to the massive increase in car traffic and thus noise by neglecting the regular bus traffic with thinned cycles and by little commitment to cycling, according to the VCD.
The municipal council also votes on the participation of the city of the energy and climate protection agency Pforzheim/Enzkreis.
The agenda also includes the accession to the Climate Protection Pact of the State of Baden-Württemberg, the redefinition of parental contributions in urban children's daycare facilities and the application for admission to the federal Smart City funding.
Citizens are welcome, but must take Corona protection measures into account.
Tim Zimmermann starts the new season with a lot of delay
Tim Zimmermann will start his premier season at the ADAC GT Masters on 31 July, almost half a year late.
Before the Supercar League could start operating on a regular basis, the first test drives were scheduled.
For Zimmermann, the main thing was to get to know his Lamborghini Huracan GT3.
The Corona crisis has long prevented Tim Zimmermann from starting his first official race in Grasser Racing’s new Lamborghini Huracan.
Under special hygienic conditions this was now possible.
The 23-year-old Langenargener made his first laps at the Lausitzring and was able to get used to his premiere in a GT3 car.
"There are a few things that are different from the Porsche from the preseason," says Zimmermann.
"With the ABS, for example, you have to go into the curves differently.
But it was really a lot of fun."
Zimmermann also had fun with Steijn Schothorst, with whom he will share his orange sports car in the GT Masters.
Despite his only 25 years of experience in GT, the Dutchman has already been able to help his new teammate in many ways.
"I'm not a beginner in motorsport, but every new series brings with it new challenges," Zimmermann says.
"Steijn and I understand each other very well and we have made enormous progress from session to session at the Lausitzring."
It is there - at the Lausitzring - that the GT Masters will also be holding its first race.
From 31 July, the 33 super sports cars will race through Lausitz.
Zimmermann, who is one of 15 newcomers to the series, knows the route.
In 2015, he was the last guest at the Motodrom.
"It worked quickly and I had to get used to the track a little," says Zimmermann, who starts for the Friedrichshafen racing community Graf Zeppelin.
"The Lausitzring has many fast passages that you have to hit optimally to be fast."
How fast the carpenter is then really, that turns out in two weeks.
"The teams are of course playing a little poker during the tests," he says.
"In the end, however, we are very satisfied and look forward to the first weekend at the Lausitzring."
The race in Brandenburg will be the start of a tight calendar.
Seven races are scheduled until the beginning of November.
Currently, no spectators will be allowed - but there is a prominent guest.
In mid-August at the Nürburgring, ex-Formel-1 driver Niko Hülkenberg will take over the GT steering wheel.
British Transport Minister caught cold by quarantine decision
The decision by the British government to quarantine Spanish holidaymakers for two weeks after their return has caught the country's Transport Minister cold, according to press reports.
According to this, Grant Shapps is currently on holiday in Spain, of all places, while his colleagues at home decided on the measure on Saturday.
Due to the rising Corona figures in Spain, the London cabinet removed the country from the list of countries from which entry without quarantine is possible.
The new rule will apply from today, Sunday, so Shapps will also have to quarantine after his return.
In Austria, the government has also imposed quarantine measures on returnees.
But the scheme applies to those who are on holiday on the day of the deadline, only from Saturday, 1 August, and was not introduced overnight.
Spain is, by the way, still regarded in Austria as one of the "safe countries" for which no quarantine is required in Austria.
"Many ministers may have known in advance that there is a possibility of quarantine being imposed on holidaymakers in Spain," commented Labour MEP Diane Abbot.
"But apparently no one bothered to tell Grant Shapp's story."
Just one month after the end of the Corona emergency in Spain and the expiry of the strict curfew, the infection rates in the country are rising again.
Virologists blame the nightlife for the new spread.
Spain is one of the favourite holiday destinations of the British.
The British Government is currently discouraging unnecessary travel to the Spanish mainland, except for the Canary Islands and Balearic Islands, which are particularly popular with British holidaymakers.
To date, more than 272,000 infections with the novel coronavirus have been registered in Spain and more than 28,000 deaths.
Russia: Navy Day: Putin announces hypersonic weapons for warships
Russian President Vladimir Putin has announced that on Navy Day in his country, warships will be equipped with the most modern hypersonic weapons.
These weapons, unique in the world, would expand the combat capabilities of the Russian navy, Putin said at the central naval parade in St. Petersburg on Sunday.
The Ministry of Defense also informed Interfax about successful tests of the Zirkon hypersonic rocket, which was built for the Navy.
The hypersonic weapons have a speed of sound many times that of about 343 meters per second.
They are considered weapons of the future.
Underwater tropedeo is being built on
It was also built on the submarine Poseidon.
The planned seaplane is designed to destroy coastal targets.
The president, who himself also sailed a military boat, said that this year alone 40 new ships would be put into service with the individual fleet associations of the largest country in the world.
Russia has a coastal area as large as no other country in the world.
For 300 years, the Navy has been reliably protecting Russia, Putin said at the day celebrated by sailors nationwide.
In many other Russian coastal areas, the navy also held parades on the day of the navy.
In Syria, where Russia is fighting alongside ruler Bashar al-Assad, the military demonstrated its strength at an arms show in the Mediterranean port of Tartu.
There was also a fire of ammunition.
In a video released by the Ministry of Defence, not only warships, including a submarine, but also helicopters and jets were on display.
Hurricane "Hanna" reaches Texas: Corona makes it harder to help
Washington - The first hurricane of this year's season across the Atlantic hit Texas on land.
Life-threatening flooding, strong winds and heavy rainfall now threatened parts of the US state, the National Hurricane Center of the US climate authority NOAA reported during the night on Sunday (local time).
Governor Greg Abbott called for a state of emergency for many counties.
The Corona pandemic in Texas is making the work of the aid workers more difficult, Abbott said according to US media.
Evacuees called to care
"Each hurricane is a huge challenge," Abbott said in the Houston Chronicle.
Looking at the Texas cyclone, he added, "This challenge is complicated and is even more acute considering that it sweeps through an area that is the most heavily affected area of the state by Covid-19."
According to the Johns Hopkins University, the Corona pandemic has killed about 5,000 people in Texas alone.
Abbott called for caution for people who had to leave their homes.
They should not disregard practices "to which we have become accustomed", such as wearing masks, the governor said according to CBS.
It is important that everyone keeps a distance.
In some places, hotel rooms were also provided.
It is also used in emergency shelters.
Damage was reported from Port Mansfield.
Storm warning withdrawn again
At wind speeds of up to 150 kilometres per hour, "Hanna" was reportedly hit on land on Padre Island just off the Texas coast.
The storm was previously classified as a Category 1 hurricane.
A storm surge warning was issued for the coastal section from Port Mansfield to Sargent and was later withdrawn.
Authorities expected a weakening as "Hanna" continued to move inland and headed for northeastern Mexico.
"Douglas" moves to Hawaii
In the Pacific, Hurricane Douglas was heading toward Hawaii at wind speeds of about 150 kilometers per hour overnight.
The hurricane center expected the storm to weaken further.
It is forecast to be near the largest islands of Hawaii on Sunday (local time) - then as a storm just below hurricane threshold.
Over the Atlantic, NOAA predicted an above-average active hurricane season this year, based on a May forecast.
From June to the end of November, up to ten hurricanes could be expected, of which up to six could be very strong cyclones, the authority had explained.
On average, there are six hurricanes per year across the Atlantic, three of which develop into major storms.
Given the available climate data and the higher water temperatures in the Atlantic and the Caribbean, the probability of a normal season was only 30 percent, and that of an under-average even only 10 percent, it was said at the time.
President Donald Trump has said that his administration is closely monitoring the storms and is in contact with the affected states.
Four goals conceded: Video assistant "punished" Sassuolo
Sassuolo's Filip Djuricic were equally two goals revoked
Naples - Four goals scored, four goals conceded: Sassuolo Calcio had a black-and-white night at SSC Naples in the Italian Serie A football league, 0:2 (0:1) - and was really mad at the video assistant of the referee.
"A festival of unfinished business for Sassuolo.
Never before has the VAR acted so hard against a team," commented the "Corriere dello Sport".
The hosts of Naples had been led by a goal from outsider Elseid Hisaj in the 8th minute, in the 32nd minute Filip Djuricic initially praised the balance.
The video assistant referee (VAR) took the shot back because of a sidelined position.
Five minutes later Djuricic again shot the ball into the net - again the VAR attacked.
The goalkeepers Francesco Caputo (50th) and Domenico Berardi (61st) were also relegated after VAR's notice.
In the post-match period Allan made the 2-0 final for Naples and the bitter evening for Sassuolo perfect.
"The VAR is worse for Sassuolo than a radar trap on the road and penalizes Sassuolo like no team before.
The new technology is setting records," writes the Gazzetta dello Sport.
FC Bayern Munich: Pavard injured
Munich (dpa) - The start of the hot preparation phase for the Champions League began for double winner FC Bayern with a setback.
Hansi Flick, who recovered "somewhat well" after a short holiday and a few days of training, has to think about how he can rebuild his successful defense after the injury of world champion Benjamin Pavard after the first team training.
The Frenchman, who has the third most minutes behind Captain Manuel Neuer and midfielder Joshua Kimmich, suffered a ligament injury to the left foot root and is threatened to miss in crucial league matches.
In Munich's muddy weather, the right-handed defender broke off a training game and was driven off the course with a golf card.
How long the unrestricted regular player has to pause in the fight for the title is open.
A place in the eighth-final draw against Chelsea on 8 August is likely to be difficult, but the 24-year-old can hope for the final tournament starting on 12 August in Lisbon.
The Bayern will not let the bad luck from the training on Sunday stop them.
Flick named in his personal triple formula the three attributes he wants to see from his stars on their way to Portugal's capital.
Quality, intensity and concentration are to show his winning title collectors in the ideally following 28 days until the final game of the Kingsclass on 23 August.
"We have simply mastered the obligatory tasks with championship and cup excellently.
Now it is up to us to create something special," said Flick.
Until the Munich players can deal with the final tournament and a training camp in the Algarve, the first goal of the eighth-final is against Chelsea.
After the 3-0 in the first leg before the Corona break, the Londoners should not become Bayern's dream again in the home arena, as they did in the lost "Finale dahoam" 2012.
"We have to go through the door first.
We want to win, create good conditions and recharge our confidence with a good game," Flick demanded.
A test of the match-up is scheduled for Friday against Olympique Marseille.
With a long speech, Flick had sworn his stars, who had 13 days off after the double, to a unique August.
He welcomed 31 players to Säbener Straße, including the new players around Edel-Einkauf Leroy Sané, who for the first time after his move from Manchester City met all new colleagues on the pitch.
"Leroy has fitted in well like all the new ones," Flick reported.
But instead of talking about the new season, when Sané & Co. can no longer just mediate, Flick preferred to talk about the current title project of the German series champion.
After days of individual and small group training, the Londoners are now being trained in team strength, which is in contrast to the Flick-Ensemble in the game rhythm.
After that, the Munich team could face FC Barcelona and Lionel Messi in the quarter-finals, while Real Madrid, Manchester City or Juventus Turin could face them in the semi-finals.
The way to the final in Lisbon "is not quite so easy", stressed the head coach, who can rely on the services of his new assistant Miroslav Klose in training from Tuesday.
The world record goalkeeper Klose and Flick know about so many common tournament preparations, what matters especially in the 0-to-100 match.
With his current team, working is "a pleasure", Flick praised.
The "focus on winning" is an impressive trait of his team.
The tournament with nine teams was also ambitious on Sunday.
All of the players were there, including Thiago and David Alaba, who was not guaranteed to stay beyond the King's Class season.
Formula 1 needs a special rule to honor its world champion
Since it is not possible to drive on the required number of continents, the FIA has to improvise in order to award the World Championship titles.
All American races were cancelled.
Race calendar is becoming more and more concrete
The racing calendar of the current Formula 1 season continues to take shape.
To the ten confirmed Grand Prix so far, three more race tracks were added during the week.
In October, the race is scheduled to take place at the Nürburgring in Germany and in Portimão, Portugal.
On the first of November Lewis Hamilton and Co. will compete for World Championship points at the Italian traditional circuit in Imola.
As of the current timetable, the 2020 race calendar comprises 13 races.
"We are pleased to continue making great progress in completing our plans for the 2020 season," said Formula One boss Chase Carey.
In total, 15 to 18 races in the motorsport's premier class are to be held in this exceptional season.
Formula One is looking to conclude its season in Asia.
The final race calendar is to be fixed and published in the coming weeks.
Prior to the already officially scheduled races in Bahrain and Abu Dhabi in December, media reports indicate that there could be further appearances in Vietnam and Malaysia at the end of November.
Regulations require races on three continents
The Formula One regulations require at least three continents to be raced in order to win the World Championship.
Although, as currently planned, only two continents are being driven, there is to be a world champion.
The FIA wants to use a special rule to award the titles on the basis of "exceptional circumstances" due to the coronavirus pandemic.
The traditional season start in Australia in March had to be cancelled due to the Corona crisis.
A return to the continent this year is not an issue.
In addition, Formula 1 will not be a guest in America this year.
Cancellation meets with criticism in Brazil
Due to the tense Corona situation, the races will not be held in Canada, the USA, Mexico and Brazil.
"We look forward to being with them again next season," Carey said.
The cancellation of the Americas races was criticized especially in Brazil: "The cancellation was not surprising for us, but the reasons for it we can not accept", said Tamas Rohonyi, promoter of the Grand Prix in São Paulo.
The number of infections in the São Paulo area is significantly lower than in other regions of Brazil.
The concerns of some teams not wanting to drive in Brazil would not justify a cancellation.
They are prepared for the required security measures.
Greta Thunberg: A bad look at Donald Trump went around the world
Greta Thunberg talked about her meeting with US President Donald Trump.
Greta Thunberg was a guest on Stephen Colbert's late-night show via video tap and revealed in an interview what she had in mind when she met Donald Trump.
Climate scientist Greta Thunberg was a guest on a popular US late night show via video tap.
She told about her struggle against the powerful of the world.
The teenager also talked about her famous "bad look" when she met Donald Trump.
New York City - In the past two years, climate activist Greta Thunberg has drawn attention to herself with her tireless commitment to the Fridays For Future movement.
Now she talked about her plans for the future and her meeting with US President Donald Trump at the UN climate summit last year in a well-known late-night show.
Latenight host Stephen Colbert welcomed the 17-year-old Thunberg on Tuesday in your show and conducted a longer interview with the Swedish.
She spoke not only about her fight against climate change, but also about her conflict with the world's powerful.
"There are some things that surprised me," she said.
"How far people are going to steer the focus away from the climate crisis," she said.
"Everything from organized hate campaigns to threats just because a group of children goes on the streets," she has experienced.
Heads of state and leaders who mock or even try to silence her on social media find her "funny" because they show her the reactions "because they have no other answer to it".
It became particularly interesting at the end of the interview when Greta Thunberg was addressed to a well-known scene in which she cast US President Trump a bitterly evil look behind her.
At the UN Climate Summit in New York in 2019, for which the activist sailed across the Atlantic, her expressive gaze was captured by the cameras and has since been seen by countless people on the Internet.
The short clip was used to create a GIF, an animated image that eventually became one of the most commonly used images for Trump opponents.
But what did the 17-year-old think about the US President at that moment?
To Stephen Colbert's relatively open question, she answered only briefly and dryly: "To be honest, I don't think there's any need for further explanation."
The experienced satirist Colbert had probably not expected the decisive answer and disappeared from the picture laughing briefly.
With her "How dare you?" speech on the principles of climate protection, she was remembered by many at the climate conference.
Ex-Dortmunder Immobile with three-pack for Lazio Rome
Ciro Immobile is now on top of Bayern's Robert Lewandowski in the race for Europe's Golden Shoe.
The former Dortmunder Ciro Immobile has the best chances to become goalkeeper-king in the Italian football championship.
The former BVB-professional contributed three goals in Lazio's 1–1 victory over Hellas Verona, including two converted penalty kicks in the post-match periods of both halves.
The 30-year-old has now 34 goals on his account from the fourth-place finish two seasons before - just as many goals as Robert Lewandowski of FC Bayern Munich scored in the past Bundesliga season.
In Italy, Cristiano Ronaldo is following with 30 goals so far, the Portuguese superstar scored with the leader in the evening on Sampdoria Genoa.
Fleetwood Mac co-founder Peter Green died
His life was like a roller coaster ride: after a rapid ascent with Fleetwood Mac, it went steeply downhill and then slowly up again.
Now blues rock guitarist Peter Green has died at the age of 73.
Genius guitarist, drug junkie, cult follower: The co-founder of Fleetwood Mac, Peter Green, is dead.
He died peacefully in his sleep at the age of 73, family members said in an official statement on Saturday, another statement would be announced for the next few days.
Top musicians such as Peter Frampton praised Green as one of the best blues and rock guitarists.
Mick Fleetwood spoke in an emotional reaction of a "monumental loss" for all former and current members of the band Fleetwood Mac.
Drummer Fleetwood and guitarist Green had formed the now long-legendary band in London in 1967, and his dreamy instrumental hit "Albatross" is still unforgettable today.
The musician's life ("The End Of The Game", "In The Skies") was like a roller coaster ride.
With Fleetwood Mac Green experienced a rapid rise - the band celebrated its greatest successes but then without him.
The group was founded in 1992, and Green was the first to donate all of the group's profits to charity.
He began to appear in wide robes and with a large crucifix.
Psychological problems also played a role.
Three years after the band's formation, Green left the band in 1970.
This was followed by a social decline.
The blues rock guitarist suffered from drug abuse and schizophrenia, as biographers reported.
Green was treated in psychiatry for a long time.
During the 1970s, the band's musicians were mostly absent from the scene.
He was a street worker, a graveyard gardener, and spent time in an Israeli kibbutz.
Green was born in 1946 to a Jewish working-class family in Bethnal Green, London.
He was a fan of blues musicians such as B.B. King and Muddy Waters.
At the age of eleven, he learned his first guitar.
At the age of 15, he began playing professional guitar and five years later he got the chance to play lead guitar for the instrumental band Peter B's Looners.
He was later signed to the Bluesbreakers as a replacement for his idol Eric Clapton.
In the midst of the blues boom, Green founded Fleetwood Mac in the summer of 1967, along with fellow Bluesbreakers Mick Fleetwood and John McVie.
The song "Albatross" composed by Green brought the group their first number one hit in the winter of 1968/69 and catapulted them to the top of the British music scene.
But the rapid rise soon showed its downsides: Green could not cope with the media hype, his experiments with the drug LSD became more and more extreme.
He later commented on the life between music and addiction in an interview: "The worst thing that happened to me in life is drugs - the best thing was to land a number one hit".
Towards the end of the decade, Green surprisingly achieved a cult success with a religiously inspired album in 1979.
Fleetwood Mac floated on a wave of success without him in a new formation.
Their 1977 album "Rumours" sold more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Despite several minor solo successes, Green did not make a major comeback until 1996, when he rejoined a group of musicians he had befriended.
The British "Daily Telegraph" spoke of a rock star who had returned to Earth.
The group released several albums with the Peter Green Splinter Group until the band split up in 2004.
For music experts, he was already a blues legend during his lifetime - and with his soft sound one of the most influential guitarists of the past decades.
