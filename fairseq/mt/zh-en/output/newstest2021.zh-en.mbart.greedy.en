Where do you find talent?
Excellent returning migrant workers are indispensable vital forces.

China's Xinhua News Agency, July 26, by wire  Subject: Putting outstanding returning migrant workers into the countryside to revitalize the vitality army
Zhang Xiong, 34, lives in Fruit Garden Village, Meishan City, Sichuan Province. In 2010, he quit his 10,000-yuan-a-month job in Beijing and went back to start a business.
After years of struggle, he now runs a family vineyard that earns more than a million dollars a year, becoming a small-profile wealthy leader and being selected to the village's "two committees" class.
In recent years, under the inspiration of a series of supportive and beneficial policies such as the country's fight against poverty and the revitalization of the countryside, more and more excellent farmer workers like Zhang Xiang have chosen to return to their hometowns to start up businesses, which has stimulated a spring flood in the countryside.
In the western part of China, Sichuan, a large province with a large population and export of labor services, has been leading the implementation of the "excellent migrant workers repatriation training project" due to the favorable economic situation.In 2019 alone, more than 8,000 village Party branch secretaries were produced from the repatriated excellent migrant workers, 61,000 village reserve forces were cultivated, and more than 20,000 Party members were developed, providing a powerful guarantee for winning the fight against poverty and implementing the strategy of rural revitalization.
Little is not little, the key is to look at the old country.
Since the reform and opening up, a large number of young and old workers in rural China have gone out to work and earned more, some of them have founded their own enterprises by struggling.
However, the objectively also led to the rural "emptying" to different degrees, especially the weakening of the rural grassroots organization, the village party branch secretary and the party members' team all showed the "one old and one young" characteristics, i.e. the ageing, low education, the village party organization leader team is not strong, the problem of the non-acceptance of the blue and yellow is prominent.
If the countryside talents and other factors are always flowing to the city, the countryside is in a state of "bloodless" and "anemia" for a long time, revival is a hollow word.
It is a policy to resolve the problem of the inadequacy of the cadres of the rural Party and the grassroots Party organizations by attracting back those farmer workers who are capable, aware and willing to serve their hometowns, guiding them back to their hometowns to start businesses and become leaders in making them rich, and by selecting the best candidates to train them into Party members and rural cadres.
Good farmers are attracted back, but they must be able to stay and do well.
In recent years, Sichuan has been working hard to establish the peasant workers' party, and on the basis of strict selection criteria, has established the system mechanisms of attracting excellent peasant workers, guaranteeing their services, training them to improve their performance, selecting them for employment, and using them for their future, so that they can really take root in the countryside and have a sense of success in entrepreneurship.
This year is the year of the recruitment of the fight to fight poverty and strengthen the government, and the link between fighting poverty and strengthening the countryside is key.
The Party committee governments at all levels should attach great importance to the outstanding returning rural migrant workers, and through comprehensive measures, make them into a workforce that can survive, fight and carry on, and a vital force, providing strong organizational guarantees and talent support for rural people to escape poverty and run for a better life and develop themselves.

Capital's Natural Ecology Continues to Be Good Attracting Wildlife to Settle in the City
Beijing's wildlife has reached more than 500 species
The Beijing Youth Daily's reporter for the City Garden Greening Bureau (CWB) was told that the species and number of wildlife have been increasing in recent years as the natural environment in the capital has continued to improve.
At present, the number of terrestrial vertebrate wildlife inhabiting Beijing has increased to more than 500 species, including nationally protected species such as brown cockroaches, black storks, and nationally protected species such as gazelle, great swan, grey crane, and duck.
Whether planted in a city forest in the Second Ring or in a small wetland embedded in buildings, it not only brings the city’s citizens nature’s wilderness, but also attracts wildlife to “settle” in the city.
In the peak of summer, it is a dynamic part of the Matsuyama National Nature Reserve in Yanqing District in the northwest Yanshan Mountains.
A fox was playing by the stream, and two badgers were fighting with each other.
As of the end of 2019, 178 species of wildlife including the gold carvings of the nationally protected animals and the second-class protected animals, including the scoop chicken and the gazelle, live in the green sea covering more than 6200 hectares, and nearly a third of the city's wildlife species can be seen here, said Hu Qiali, director of the Matsuyama National Nature Reserve Administration.
"In Matsuyama, wildlife is the real 'owner' and our staff can only be the 'guardian' at best," he said.
Mr. Hu said more than 30 professional rangers patrol the area every day, following 16 carefully designed routes, and a "roundabout" every month, covering almost the entire area for the entire day.
"The inspections not only check the biodiversity records, but also the installation of artificial bird nests, the rescue of injured wildlife, the installation of outdoor infrared cameras, and so on.
The Matsuyama National Nature Reserve has installed more than 200 infrared cameras to record the living conditions of wildlife in the forest.
As the biodiversity of the protected areas has become more and more abundant over the years, more and more wildlife has been featured in the film, and leopard cats, rhinos and badgers have become regular guests.
Zhang Zhiming, director of the Wildlife and Wetland Protection Department of the Beijing Botanical Greening Bureau, said that the number of terrestrial vertebrate wildlife in Beijing has increased from 461 species in 1994 to more than 500 species today.
The appearance of wild animals in the city is becoming more and more common, and it is closely related to the urban greening of the capital city.
In particular, the new round of million-acre forest greening construction, which began in 2018, proposes to reshape the urban ecological environment, enhance the ecological function of forest lands and green spaces, and highlight the concept of "near nature".
The park is designed to interact with the surrounding green spaces, to facilitate wildlife "visiting friends and family", and the trees planted are also the animals' favorite honey and food source plants.
"The Black Land" and "Seed" in Agricultural Modernization - Xinhua News Agency
Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, July 26, wire-mail  Subject: Black land "seed" to modernize agriculture
In the summer, two spraying agents planes passed through the 10,000-acre high-yield demonstration fields of the second operational station of the Friendship Farm's Fifth Management Area, forming two white lines.
The aircraft sprays pesticides on more than 6,000 acres of farmland a day, eight times more efficient than drones and hundreds of times more efficient than human-made ones, said Kong Lingqiang, the head of the operations station.
The farm is located in Friendship County, Heilongjiang Province, China's first food-producing province. From the past "hacking" of the cutting of rice to the present "long-long" motor sound, Chinese traditional farming and farming in this black soil zone has been transformed.
In addition to aircraft, satellites are also used in modern agricultural production on Friendship Farms.
On the one hand, they use satellite remote sensing technology to achieve accurate fertilization, reduce agricultural inputs and reduce pollution, and on the other hand, satellite navigation technology can improve the standardized operation level of farm machinery and fields, Mr.
In the rice production this year, the farm expanded its satellite-navigated, unmanned-seedling operation from 3,000 to 30,000 acres last year.
This technology makes the seedlings more evenly planted, maximizes the use of sunlight and arable land resources, and saves $16 per acre in labor costs.
Farms try to use information technology and intelligent technology in agricultural production, and form the largest agricultural machinery group in China from the ground to the sky.
According to statistics, the total number of farm machinery holdings is 49,000 units (pieces), and the combined mechanization rate of the field is 99.8%.
Agricultural machinery operations achieved 100% GPS satellite navigation, 100% precision sowing in dry fields, 100% operation of dry fields horsepower locomotives.
Green agriculture, intelligent agriculture and digital agriculture are the directions of agricultural modernization.
said Liu Hualian, the director of Friendship Farm.
The key to modernization of agriculture lies in the progress of science and technology.
In recent years, Heilongjiang Agricultural Reclamation, which is represented by farms, has played a leading role in demonstrating and guiding modern large-scale agriculture as a "carrier", and has initially established a modern agricultural industrial system that is dominated by scale-up cultivation, standardized production and industrialized operation.
In the suburbs of Friendship County, there is a 350,000-square-meter agricultural machinery exhibition park.
The exhibition centers on more than 140 agricultural machinery and equipment that Heilongjiang Agricultural Reclamation has introduced and used for many years.
These agricultural machinery and farms witnessed the development of China's agricultural modernization.

France's Notre Dame church fire: parish volunteers admit arson peace and goodwill-Chinanews.net
The church of Saint Peter and Saint Paul, a jewel of religious history in Nantes, France, was severely damaged in a fire and the organ completely destroyed, foreign media reported on July 18.
On 26 January, the local prosecutor, Nate, announced that a parish volunteer who had been responsible for guarding the cathedral had been indicted on charges of "inciting arson and destruction".
He has admitted that he set fire to the church.
The 39-year-old parish volunteer from Rwanda admitted to setting fire to three of the church's interiors at night, local prosecutor Senath said, according to reports.
The man's lawyer said the arsonists now regretted doing so.
The man had entered France several years earlier by way of refuge, and had been given shelter in the diocese where the fire had occurred and had been taken into the church.
The prosecutor said he was in talks with the police about his recent attempt to renew his visa.
The church, however, said it still did not believe that the ordinary, kind, smiling, but unspoken believer would destroy the church he loved so much.
The volunteer was questioned by police on the day of the fire, but was later released after he had been questioned by police about a misunderstanding in his account.
The picture shows the firefighters on the scene.
On the evening of 25 July, the man was again summoned to appear, as new evidence was obtained by a professional engineer at the laboratory of the Central Bureau of Police in Paris.
This time, the man admitted to arson.
If convicted of arson, the suspect could face a 10-year prison sentence and a €150,000 fine.
The fire reportedly caused severe damage to the cathedrals of St. Pierre and St. Paul, where the organ was completely destroyed and the stained glass windows behind the organ were severely damaged.
The chief architect of the French Historical Preservation Building, Jean-Pierre Brunet, estimated that the restoration of the cathedral would take at least three years.
"China's unilateralism undermines US-China relations: China's anti-Americanism".
Xinhua, July 26, 2007 (TJPN) - On the morning of July 24, the Chinese Foreign Ministry informed the U.S. Embassy in China that China has decided to revoke the permit for the establishment and operation of the U.S. Consulate General in Chengdu and made specific requests to the Consulate General to cease all operations and activities.
The international public opinion believes that the unilateralist measures adopted by the United States have caused serious trouble in the relations between China and the United States.China has responded to the unreasonable provocation by the United States and it is legitimate and necessary to take countermeasures.
'The unilateral measures of the United States have damaged the bridge of understanding between the peoples of the United States and China,' said Andrea Borges, director of the Center for China Studies at the University of Chile's Institute for International Studies.
China's notification of the closure of the US Consulate General in Chengdu is a countermeasure to unilateral US measures and is in line with diplomatic practice.
Patricio Justo, professor at the Catholic University of Argentina and director of the Center for Sino-Arab Studies, said the Chinese decision was a legitimate and necessary countermeasure to the US's previous provocation, not against ordinary Americans.
The US is trying to distract Americans by pressuring China to cover up its weakness in dealing with the new crop.
'The U.S. has taken a provocative diplomatic stance, which has caused serious trouble in the relations between the two countries, and the two countries face serious challenges,' said Banpong Suryono, president of the Asia Innovation Research Center of the Indonesian think tank.
It is a normal countermeasures to notify the United States of the closure of its Consulate General in Chengdu.It is in line with diplomatic practice, reflecting China's principled position of resolutely defending its interests and the rationality and efficiency of Chinese diplomacy.
Tanzanian news commentator Francis Semwinza said the decision was a legitimate and necessary response to the U.S. provocation.
The US should take the initiative to improve relations with China and stop interfering in China's internal affairs.
The United States should focus on how to win economically and politically with China and how to benefit both peoples and the entire international community.
Ali Yousaf, executive director of the Sudan-based Arab-China Friendship Association, said the countermeasures China was forced to take were a legitimate and necessary response to US unreasonable actions, in line with international law and the basic norms of international relations, as well as diplomatic practice.
The US had previously demanded the closure of the Chinese Consulate General in Houston, in grave violation of international law and the basic norms of international relations.
The US hopes to reverse the decision and create the necessary conditions for normal relations between the two countries.
The United Morning Post in Singapore, in an editorial, said the US's larger strategic intention was to block China and prevent its continued rise.
Faced with the increasing pressure from the United States, China, while reluctant to see the relationship deteriorate further, has to take countermeasures.

Hurricane Hanna makes landfall in the state of Med or triggers river surges and flooding - China New Net
Hurricane Hanna made landfall in Texas at 5pm local time on July 25, causing heavy rainfall, river flooding and potentially life-threatening mountain flooding.
The National Hurricane Center said Hurricane Hanna was expected to carry heavy rainfall, sweeping parts of southern and northeastern Texas, causing rainfall or torrential surges in some streams and life-threatening flash flooding.
Hurricane Hanna was reported to have been most severely affected from south of Corpus Christi to the mouth of the Grand River, and the Rio Grande Valley was likely to be affected by widespread flooding.
"Any hurricane is a huge challenge," Governor Abbott said on Sunday.
The hurricane placed 32 counties in the state under a state of emergency.
The city of Corpus Christi, with a population of over 320,000, has closed its libraries and museums and residents are on the move.
He said the hurricane could not be allowed to cause more deaths in Texas as the state was facing a new crown disease.
South Texas is expected to receive 6 to 12 inches of rainfall overnight on the 26th, with 3 to 5 inches of rainfall in northern Texas and along the Louisiana coast.
Due to global warming and other factors, Hanna formed earlier than previous Atlantic hurricane seasons.
Typically, the first Atlantic hurricane does not form until mid-August.
Poland to withdraw from Europe's treaty to prevent violence against women
The Polish Ministry of Justice said Saturday that Poland would take steps next week to withdraw from the European treaty to prevent violence against women.
The Polish right-wing government cabinet said the treaty violated the rights of parents by requiring schools to teach students about gender issues.
Polish Justice Minister Piotr Joblow told reporters that his Ministry of Justice will ask the Ministry of Labour and Family Affairs to begin withdrawing from the treaty Monday.
The treaty was also known as the Istanbul Convention.
"The treaty contains elements that we think are harmful in terms of their morphology," Joublot said.
The Polish ruling Law and Justice Party and its coalition partners are closely aligned with the Roman Catholic Church and advocate a conservative social agenda.
Polish President Aleksander Duda has made the issue of anti-gay rights one of his main themes during his successful re-election campaign this month.
On Friday, thousands of Poles, mostly women, protested in Warsaw and other cities against the withdrawal from the convention.
One of the protesters, Liam Patt, said during a protest march in Warsaw that "the purpose of withdrawing from the treaty is to legalize domestic violence".
Some protesters held banners that read, "The Law and Justice Party is the hell of women."
The leader of the Law and Justice Party has long complained about the Istanbul Convention.
The convention was ratified by Poland's previous centre-right government in 2015.
The government of the Law and Justice Party said the treaty did not respect religion and required liberal social policies to be taught in schools.
However, the party has not yet decided to withdraw from the convention.

Russian Armed Helicopter Carrier-52M
The upgraded version of the Russian armed helicopter, the Ka-52M, will be completed for the first time in December and will be factory-installed, according to a Russian defense ministry plan, with a significant improvement in reconnaissance, communications and weapons performance.
The first two of the upgraded versions of the VNG--52M are undergoing conversion at Far Eastern Helicopter Manufacturing Plant of Progressive Aerospace Group, with the national testing and refit completion scheduled for October 2022, according to the Russian news agency.
The Russian experts who are known to have worked on the upgrade said that the "ancestor" of the "Super Short-Kiss Crocodile" - the Wuzhika-52 was officially installed in November 2011, the aircraft model exposed some weaknesses in use, this upgrade is to "complement the short board".
The new aircraft will be equipped with new anti-missile equipment, which will increase the chances of survival in the field; a larger generator will be installed to power more complex airborne electronics; the optical and electronic systems will be upgraded to detect and identify targets farther away from the battlefield; a new lightweight multi-purpose missile with a range of 20 km will be equipped with mainly attack armoured vehicles and reinforced concrete defenses, which will increase the range of similar missiles used directly by the Russian armed forces by about one-fold; and its defense weapons and communications equipment will be as common as possible with the M-28NM armed helicopters that can attack air targets, making maintenance easier and more economical.
The Ka-52M will also have advanced electronic guidance systems, weapons aiming systems, and navigational equipment.
Russian experts also said that it was of interest that the Ka-52M would be equipped with communications equipment that would link to UAVs, so that real-time information about nearby UAVs could be obtained in the air, such as images of the UAVs being filmed on the helicopter's cabin screen.
The Ka-52M's pilots are expected to be able to directly control the UAVs that are in service with the aircraft, thereby improving the pilot's command of the battlefield situation and the guidance of long-range missiles.
According to Russian media, Russian Deputy Defense Minister Sergei Krivoruchko said last December that the Russian Defense Ministry plans to buy more than 110 military helicopters by 2027.

At the same time, nine large and medium-sized reservoirs such as the Western Ocean, Dongwu Service and the White Ocean Dian River were used to replenish the ecological waters of the Xiangyang River and the Qinglong River, and the total surface area of the waters formed exceeded 90 square kilometers.
To do a good job of ecological water recharge, the Hebei Water Conservancy Office has actively organized the investigation, correction and reinforcement of rivers and river channels with potential for water recharge, fine-tuning practical measures and strengthening inspection and control.
Through supervised inspection and concentrated secret visit, all kinds of problems are solved in time, ensuring the river recharge is safe and orderly.
According to the relevant heads of Hebei Water Conservancy Office, the orderly implementation of ecological water recharge has effectively restored the ecological environment of rivers and lakes in Hebei Province, promoted the recharge and retention of coastal groundwater, greatly improved the living environment and economic development environment along the rivers and lakes, and has important significance for the management and protection of the rivers and lakes that are "clean, green, smooth and beautiful".
(German Voice) In the past two weeks, new coronary heart disease cases in Spain have risen sharply, with thousands more cases reported in the past few days.
The British government temporarily removed Spain from its safe travel list late Saturday (25 July) at 0600 local time, and people entering the UK from Spain must be kept in isolation for 14 days.
British tourists on holiday in Spain have been surprised, worried, and even angry at the sudden and startling news.
Britain's Transport Secretary, Grant Shapps, is reportedly on holiday in Spain.
Prior to the British announcement of the isolation measures, Norway had also announced a 10-day isolation of returnees from Spain.
France and Belgium have advised their residents to abandon plans to holiday in Barcelona and the surrounding area ahead of time.
The beaches in these areas were crowded and social distances between people were not maintained, and police needed to take measures to reduce the number of beach visitors.
Tourism is a major pillar of Spain's economy
Spain: It's safe here
Spain's foreign ministry said Sunday the country's outbreak was under control, following a decision by Britain.
"Spain is safe, not only for Spaniards, but also for tourists," Spanish Foreign Minister Rancha Gonzalez Laya told the media.
The Spanish government will try to persuade the British to exclude the Balearic Islands and the Canary Islands from the isolation measures.
The reason is that the infection rates in these two tourist destinations are far lower than in the UK.
To prevent the spread of the disease, the Spanish Catalonia region has also re-introduced a foot-and-mouth ban.
Tourism is a major pillar of Spain's economy and Spain is one of the most popular holiday destinations for British tourists.
The decision in the UK is expected to have a major impact on Spanish tourism.

"The first day of the Chinese Volcano: Beijing temporarily high temperatures and hot summer open rainfall pattern".
Xinhua News Agency (news reporter Ni Yuan Jin) said by wire on July 26 that July 26 was the first day of the year's "China-US ambush".
The storm's heavy rainfall in the early morning of 26 January, which dissipated the heat and humidity that had been over Beijing for days, was expected to continue for several days.
The Beijing Meteorological Bureau announced at 11:00 on 26 January that there would be dispersed showers (with weak thunderstorms) in Beijing on 26 January, with the highest temperature of 27 °C (77 °F) on the day and a slight to moderate rainfall (with weak thunderstorms) at night.
The previous day, 24-25, the city was under a blue alert of high temperatures, with the highest temperatures in most areas around 37 °C (77 °F) and locally over 40 °C (77 °F).
The most commonly used term for the day is "summer", which is the warmest, driest, and driest day of the year.
When the house is full of grain, the people say "one dumpling and two noodles".
According to the current forecast, Beijing will have a cloudy and rainy weather for the next three days.
The weather department advised the public to minimize mountaineering and to beware of geological disasters.
It is understood that this year's "mid-air ambush" has 20 days, starting on July 26 and ending on August 14.
After entering the "middle" one will feel tired and hungry.
The foods that can be eaten include green beans, cow's milk, and other foods that have a clearing effect on heat and relieve heat, and those that have a good appetite.
"Airline to cancel 2000 Boeing 747s".
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued an emergency airworthiness directive on 24 April, requiring an emergency check of approximately 2,000 Boeing 737NG and 737 Classic aircraft registered in the United States, which could cause engines to stop in midair after the airlock valve was damaged.
The Federal Aviation Administration said it had received four reports of aircraft engines being stopped in the air so far on the 737NG and 737 Classic, and had therefore issued an emergency inspection request for aircraft that had been grounded for seven consecutive days or more and had flown less than 11 flights since re-entry.
The FAA warned that if the Class 5 check valve of all two engines on the aircraft were to be corroded, it could be stuck open, causing the aircraft to lose all power and unable to restart the engine.
The airline regulator ordered that airlines replace this key component before the aircraft could be put back into service once the check valve was found to be corroded.
Boeing responded later that day that the outbreak of the new crop disease had reduced travel demand, resulting in many aircraft being blocked or used less frequently, and that “stop valves were more susceptible to corrosion.”
Boeing also said it had recommended that airlines inspect the aircraft involved in the directive and that it would provide assistance in repairing and replacing the check valves if problems were found.
The Associated Press reported that airlines were flying more than one flight a day, but that a large number of flights were grounded after the outbreak, and some were re-opened as demand for travel slowed recently.
The Federal Aviation Administration did not release the details of four aerial parking reports.
Alaska Airlines revealed one of the incidents later that night.
The airline said in a statement that its plane on July 15 from Seattle, Washington to Austin, Texas, an engine suddenly went out and the plane finally made an emergency landing at Austin Airport.
Alaska Airlines said it had replaced the engines on the plane and had checked six aircraft engines as directed by the Federal Aviation Administration.
American Airlines, United Airlines and Southwest Airlines said on Tuesday that their aircraft had no engines that had been affected by the air-lock valve.
Four American Airlines aircraft will be inspected, and 28 United Airlines aircraft will be inspected.
Delta Air Lines said it would check 20 of its aircraft, but did not say if engines had been out of order.
Several media reports claimed that the Federal Aviation Administration's emergency landing instructions were another blow to Boeing.
Indonesian Lion Airlines and Ethiopian Airlines each lost one Boeing 737 MAX in October 2018 and another in March 2019, killing 346 people.
The series of aircraft then ceased to fly globally, and production was halted in January and resumed in May.
In June, Federal Aviation Administration Director Steve Dickson admitted that the agency had made a “mistake” in its regulation of Boeing’s 737 MAX aircraft.

Mr Cheung said the Government had launched a comprehensive free virus testing programme for certain high-risk groups, namely elderly care homes, disabled and nursing home staff, restaurant staff, taxi drivers and property management staff, involving up to 400,000 people.
He was very concerned about the cases of infection in the elderly care homes. The Government had arranged special temporary quarantine centres for the elderly care homes.
The Government is building quarantine facilities near the Chiu Kai Wan Quarantine Centre in Lantau Island, New Territories, and is expected to provide an additional 700 quarantine rooms by the end of September.
The Chief Executive also announced on 19th that the HKSAR Government will build 2,000 more quarantine rooms at the Chiu Kai Wan Quarantine Centre and aim to complete them by the end of this year.

There are currently four quarantine centres in operation in Hong Kong, providing about 2,600 quarantine rooms.
The Government also reopened Lei Yue Mun Park Resort on Hong Kong Island on 24 April as a community isolation facility for patients under 50 years of age with independent self-care.
"The New China: The New China's History".

“We must let 1.4 billion people, more than 90 million Party members, and especially leading cadres at all levels, learn the history of the Communist Party of China and the history of New China well,” the Chinese President stressed during a visit to the Memorial Hall of the Four-Ping War.
It is a must-learn lesson for Party members to learn the history of the Party and the history of New China with seriousness, without forgetting their original intentions and keeping in mind their mission.
A vast history of the Party and New China records the hard work and glorious course of the Communist Party of China since its birth, demonstrating the belief and loyalty of the Communists, the original heart and mission that they have cast with their lives and blood.
History is the best textbook, and for Party members, the history of the Party and the history of New China is the most brilliant chapter in this textbook.
Each Party member should constantly strengthen his or her historical thinking, taking history as a guide and moving towards the future, and should base his or her new mission on the new quest, take the "connecting rod" of the times and follow the long quest of contemporaries.
To cast the soul of history, in the study of the Party history, the history of New China, to stick to the mission of the original heart.
The history of the Party and New China is full of the constant mission of the Communists and their rock-solid beliefs, which show the simpleness of the Communists' commitment to the people.
To learn the history of the Party, the history of New China, important events, important meetings, important people at close range is not only an intuitive shock to the mind, but also a baptism of thought.
For the Party cadres, if they want to keep up the mission of the original heart and maintain their advanced character, they must find the starting point and the supporting point of the original heart from the history of the Party and the history of New China, maintain a clear understanding and a firm position, excite the strength to fight valiantly for the country and its people, and ensure that the red rivers and mountains that the revolutionary ancestors struck with blood and life are passed down from generation to generation.
It is wise to study history and inherit the noble spirit in studying the history of the Party and the history of New China.
Since the founding of the Communist Party of China, the Red Ship Spirit, the Inokashima Spirit, the Long March Spirit, the Yan'an Spirit, the Anti-War Spirit, the Saipao Spirit, the "two-shot one-star" Spirit, the Space Spirit and a series of other great spirits have been shaped.
These great spirits under the sediment of history provide a powerful spiritual inspiration for our Party to overcome various risks and challenges on its way forward. They are a precious spiritual treasure that cannot be broken, scattered or snatched away.
The process of learning the history of the Party and China is the process of re-awakening these spirits and shaping one's own spirit.We should consciously look to the lofty spirit of our revolutionary predecessors as a mirror, and keep the spirit homeland of the Communists, and lay a solid spiritual foundation for the advancement of great undertakings and the realization of great dreams.
He is a devoted scholar of the history of the Chinese Communist Party and the history of New China.
For Party members, no history can bring more profound warning, inspiration and reference than the history of the Party and the history of New China.
In the history of the Party and New China, we can see the great achievements of the old generation of revolutionaries, who devoted themselves to faith and made great efforts to achieve their stated goals.We can also see the profound lessons of some people, who were shaken by their ideals and beliefs and went to the opposite side of the revolution, who inspired and warned us to persevere with firm determination and will, to remain steadfast in the spirit of struggle, to keep purifying Party character and cultivating our own discipline.
To truly become a firm believer and a faithful practitioner of the far-reaching ideals of communism, we need to brush away the dust of thought and guard against the stain of it.
He is a keen historian, and has taken on a new responsibility in the study of the history of the Party and the history of New China.
The Chinese President pointed out that "learning the history of the Party and the history of the country is a necessary lesson to persevere and develop socialism with Chinese characteristics and push forward the various undertakings of the Party and the country."

Each Party member should study the history of the Party and the history of New China as a lifelong pursuit, constantly set the course for his life in his study, and take up the historical mission courageously, take responsibility and take active initiatives in his or her respective positions.
We will continue to use the advanced achievements of the old revolutionaries as a reference and guide, polish the political essence of the Communists, maintain the spirit of struggle that only fights for the future, strives to do something, and strives to move forward with greater difficulty.
"Segami Jiangnan" to Search for Poetry "Huanghe Dream" - CSN
(Chinese Poverty Reduction Story) "Sealing Up Jiangnan" Search for Poetry "Huanghe Dream"
"The Yellow River is a vast expanse of sand, and the waves and winds are bumpy from the ends of the earth," Zhongxinsha Yinchuan said in a telegram on July 26.
The Yellow River, which has inspired countless literati and children to be passionate, has nurtured the beautiful and rich Ningxia Plain. Now, Ningxia, which has the reputation of "sealing the southern Jiangsu River", is pursuing the idea of "ecological priority and green development" and the "Huang River Dream" in poetry.
The "Bamboo Dream" of Shimizu Show
The Yellow River flows through Ningxia, China, 397 km (97 mi) from the north to the south, and is the mother river of the Ningxia Province.
However, with the rapid advance of industrialization and urbanization, the development, utilization and management of rivers and lakes have imbalanced, and disturbances such as excessive discharge of sewage, lake-side farming, and encroachment on water bodies have emerged, leading to black odor, excessive water quality, environmental pollution, and ecological degradation.
Now Ningxia is promoting the restoration of water ecosystem diversity, and striving to restore the Yellow River to its water-quality level.
Water is to be treated from the source.
In Ningxia, the local government adopted the "bid + sewage treatment + strict management" method, all sewage in industrial parks was centralized, all urban sewage treatment plants were discharged according to the standard of Class A, and black odor water in urban built-up areas was basically eliminated.
In addition, Ningxia Province implemented the river lake length system in 2017, and now has achieved the responsibility system of the district city county village five-level river lake length system, river lake length patrol becomes the norm.
Gu Jincheng, 64, who lives in a village on the Yellow River, witnessed the change: "The water used to smell like a foam, but after it was cleaned up, it doesn't smell like one anymore.
Gu Jincheng said the ecological environment is better and his life is more comfortable. Now he often goes for a walk with his family by the Yellow River to feel the blue sky.
The "Wetland Dream" of the Sand Gulls
Birds, green trees, farmsteads, blue water ... the beauty of the "sand gulls' floating cluster" written by Fan Zhong became a reality in Ningxia's Yellow River Wetland Park.
The Yellow River passes through Ningxia, forming a variety of wetlands along the way, such as river wetlands, lake wetlands, swamp wetlands, etc., which play an important role in promoting the rational use of water resources and water ecological balance, and also becomes an important international bird migration route.
Since 2009, Ningxia departments have invested about RMB34.5 billion in wetland protection projects.At present, the area of Yinchuan Wetland is 19.2 million hectares, the wetland protection rate is 78.5%, there are nearly 200 natural lakes and marsh wetland, there are 5 national wetland parks, 1 national urban wetland park, 6 autonomous region-level wetland parks, and 8 city-level parks.
"The remaining gulls are an endangered bird species, with only 20,000 in the world, of which more than 2,000 live in the Yinchuan Wetland," Lü Jinhu, deputy director of the Yinchuan Wetland Conservation Center, told reporters.
At the same time, Ningxia has legally delineated a 500-meter red line for the cross-Straits Wetland Protection Area of the Yellow River and Yinchuan section, stipulating that no unit or individual may carry out development and construction and operation activities within the protected area, except for public welfare projects.
"The water is clear, the fish are swimming and the flowers are blooming," Zhao Shaoyong, vice director of Yinchuan City Water Conservancy Service Center, said.
The "Dream of Drinking Water" for the People of the People's Republic of China
Ningxia Yinchuan once had an "embarrassing" nickname: the only city along the Yellow River "to guard the water shortage".
Since 2010, the city has been facing a persistent summer rush hour water shortage problem, and the "water shortage pain" of the past decade has been a summertime experience for many high-rise residents, but under the current situation of over-exploitation limits in major water sources and underground urban underground water over-exploitation funnel area, water shortage has become a problem that has plagued the city.
Thanks to the improvement of the quality of the Yellow River water, the drinking water of the purified Yellow River becomes a good solution to the local residents' drinking water problems.
To improve the demand for water for urban and rural residents' daily production, Ningxia Province has launched a water supply project on the western boundary of the urban and rural areas of the Yinchuan metropolitan area in a timely manner, replacing the existing groundwater source with high-quality Yellow River water, Ding Ming, deputy director of the Yinchuan City Water Bureau, said.
"On December 29, 2019, the water supply project officially opened to the three districts of Yinchuan City, and in 2020, residents of Minning Town and Haran County also drank the Yellow River."
Ding Ming said the Yinchuan Water Department will consider the integration of rural drinking water and urban water supply in the region. "Next, we will integrate the distributed rural water supply points into the West Line after all, and we expect to achieve the urban-rural integration of the Yinchuan region by the end of this year.
Strengthening flood prevention and relief efforts in all departments - China New Media
Strengthening flood prevention and relief efforts in all departments
CCTV News (News Link): According to the Ministry of Water Resources, the water level of the section below the Wangjiaba of the Huai River in the main stream was over-warned at 12 o'clock today (July 25), from 0.64 to 3.31 meters, and the water level of the section below the Sha City in the main stream and the two lakes in the middle and lower Yangtze River was over-warned at 0.05 to 2.02 meters.
The lake has been inactive for 28 days since the 28 June over-water alert.
Today at 12 o'clock, Taihu Lake averaged 4.67 meters, exceeding the guaranteed water level of 0.02 meters.
Today, the National Defense Council (NDC) has decided to continue to maintain the flood-prevention response at the second level of the Yangtze River and Huai River, and demands that all regions shoulder their responsibilities and further implement flood prevention and relief activities.

US launches first anti-subsidy investigation against China for "undervaluing the yuan"
The US Department of Commerce has announced it has decided to launch an anti-dumping and anti-subsidy investigation into bundled products originating in China and into a project that undervalues the renminbi.
China's Commerce Ministry said it was the first time the U.S. had filed an investigation into a project that allegedly undervalued the renminbi's exchange rate in an anti-subsidy case, and China firmly opposed it.
The Ministry of Commerce issued a press release on the evening of the 23rd saying that China has a floating exchange rate system based on market supply and demand, adjusted by reference to a basket of currencies, and managed, and that the market plays a decisive role in the formation of exchange rates.
The press release stressed that, overall, the RMB's exchange rate was at a reasonable equilibrium level and was not undervalued.
Since 2005, the renminbi has appreciated by more than 17% against the dollar.
According to data released by the International Settlement Bank, the renminbi's nominal effective exchange rate rose 38% and its real effective exchange rate rose 49% between early 2005 and May 2020, making it the strongest currency in the G20 and one of the fastest-growing currencies worldwide.
The Ministry of Commerce said the exchange rate issue exceeds the power of members to conduct anti-subsidy investigations in accordance with World Trade Organization rules.
The US amended its rules in February to investigate countervailing duties on other countries' exchange rates, which have been subject to widespread opposition, on suspicion of violating WTO rules.
Even under US law, the press release said, the applicant's complaints were largely flawed and lacked the necessary anti-subsidy elements of financial support, benefit allocation and specialization.
China urged the US to abide by existing international rules and stop conducting anti-subsidy investigations into the so-called “undervaluation of the renminbi exchange rate.”
The renminbi fell sharply on the 22nd day of trading against the U.S. dollar, both of which fell below the $1-yuan mark against the yuan of 7.0, as tensions between China and the U.S. further heightened.
The US Department of Commerce's move is worthy of attention as to whether it is intended to push the yuan up.
The renminbi's spot exchange rate against the U.S. dollar rose 23 days to 6.9961, above the 7.0 mark.
The officially regulated renminbi-dollar exchange rate was down 17 basis points to 6.9938 on the 24th.

"China's Foreign Minister accuses the United States of fabricating lies against China".
Mr. Areasa said the recent political, diplomatic, economic and public pressure exerted by the U.S. government on China is an unfounded attack on a sovereign nation.
Mr. Areasa forwarded the tweets that Chinese Ambassador to Venezuela Li Baorong posted on his personal account earlier that day and made the above comments.
In the tweet, Li said China strongly condemned the US forcible entry of China into the Consulate General in Houston, which is a serious violation of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations and the Sino-American Consular Treaty.
Government officials, social figures and mainstream media reporters, including Venezuelan Vice President Rodrigo Malmierca Díaz and Carlos Long, the vice minister for North America, also sent out a tweet condemning the United States' actions as a serious violation of international law.
The Philippines's total number of confirmed cases of new coronary pneumonia rose to 80,000 on 26 April, the day before President Donald Trump issued his fifth State of the Union Address (SONA), bringing the number of confirmed cases to 25 for the Department of Public Information (PCOO) and its staff.
To this end, PCOO has prepared a working group without contacting the staff to coordinate the press release of SONA by President Duterte.
PCOO Minister Martin Andanar said in an interview with DZBB Radio on 26th that two sets of plans had been prepared for the publication of SONA format for President Duterte.
Under Plan A, Duterte will deliver SONA on the afternoon of 27th at the Batasang Pambansa building in Quizon City.
Due to the epidemic, only 50 seats were reserved for some members of the cabinet and legislators, and a video conference room was set up for other cabinet members, local government officials, and others to watch.
All attendees were allowed to enter the Capitol through a rapid security check.
Once a participant is positive, Plan B is activated, with President Duterte announcing SONA at the Presidential Palace in Maracaibo, and fewer seats are available.
As a rule, SONA broadcasts live to Fiji nationwide.
As of the time of the writing, the President's Office has not yet confirmed whether Duterte's family will be present at SONA.
Mr. Andanar said President Duterte's SONA will focus on how the government will lead the Philippines in responding to the new cholera epidemic and restoring socio-economic life, as well as on his commitments to fight anti-government corruption, illicit drugs and poverty reduction.
Mr Duterte will also outline other plans of the current administration, including creating more jobs, revitalizing the economy, promoting education, and helping Filipino workers overseas who are suffering from the epidemic.
"Support for the Stability of Kindergarten Teachers in Yinchuan".
Xinhua News Agency (Aifu Mei) said on July 26 that the kindergartens in Ningxia's Yinchuan City have not been reopened due to the epidemic, especially the increasing pressure on private kindergartens' funds, which has some impact on the stability of the kindergarten teachers' workforce and the future sustainable development.
In response, Yinchuan City has taken a number of measures to support the teachers in these kindergartens, including the provision of pre-allocation subsidies for publicly-run kindergartens, the provision of stable subsidies for non-publicly-run kindergartens, and the reduction and waiver of rent for privately-run kindergartens.
According to the relevant policies of Yinchuan City, if during the epidemic period, the organizers of public-private kindergartens (including those in urban districts that have been converted to public-private kindergartens after the management of the supporting kindergartens) pay basic living expenses of not less than $1,660 per month to teaching staff in accordance with the minimum wage standards of the three districts, the city's finance will allocate a six-month subsidy fund to settle teachers' salaries and social insurance expenses in accordance with the standard of 1,000 yuan per student per year for the average funds for public-private kindergartens.
For non-public private kindergartens, which also provide basic living expenses of not less than $1,660 per month to teaching staff, Yinchuan will provide six-month grants to ensure the childcare teachers' safety and security in accordance with the standard of $500 per student per year.
At the same time, for private kindergartens that rent state-owned assets to operate, Yinchuan City will reduce the rent of the house for three months during the immunization prevention and control period, and encourage developers and other lessors to take on social responsibility, and reduce the rent of kindergartens and exempt the rent for more than three months, and according to the policy provisions, reduce the relevant taxes and fees.
The third flood of Yangtze River in 2020 - Ministry of Water Resources's detailed and practical response measures - China New Net
Xinhua News Agency (Beijing Daily News) - The third flood of the Yangtze River in 2020 formed on July 26.
The Minister of Water Resources, Mr. O Keng Ping, on 26th of May, during the meeting, requested that the Three Gorges Reservoir be carefully regulated, that the upstream of the Yangtze River and Lake Dongting be considered in an integrated manner, that the fault-point regulation be implemented, that the reservoir be kept in order to prepare for the possible floods, and that the flood protection of the downstream and middle rivers and the important dikes of Lake Dongting be ensured.
It is forecast that heavy rains will fall in parts of southwestern China, southern Jianghuai, northwestern Jiangnan, southeastern Hubei, central Guangxi, and other areas over the next three days, including parts of northern Hunan and southwestern Jiangsu.
The Ministry of Water Resources (WRM) estimates that the flooding from the upper Three Gorges Reservoir in the Yangtze River could reach about 60,000 cubic metres per second before 28 days later. The water level of the middle-flowing main stream in the Lotus Pond and Dongting Lake sections will rise again and exceed 0.20 metres.
The rescue team then proceeded to the nearby river, where they were able to reduce the flooding and reduce the flooding to a minimum.
We should do well in dealing with the heavy rain and flood in Yiqi and Sabi Rivers.
He said the Taihu basin should continue to exert unrelenting efforts to increase the outflow of flooding, reduce the water level of Taihu and the surrounding river network as soon as possible, and reduce the risk of high water level and typhoon in Taihu.
In addition, he stressed that the floods in northern areas such as Inner Mongolia and Hebei Provinces have steep rises and falls, and the early warning time is short, making it very easy to cause landslides and mudslides in mountainous floods, which make it difficult to defend.
APPs infringing on users' rights and interests in Section 58 exposed - China New Media
The Ministry of Industry and Communications noted that, according to the Law on Cyber Security, Regulations on Telecommunications, Provisions on the Protection of Personal Information of Telecommunications and Internet Users, and other laws and regulations, the third-party testing agencies have recently organized inspection of mobile phone application software and urged enterprises with problems to make corrections.
The 58 apps have problems with self-collection, over-extension of personal information, frequent application, excessive request, difficulty deleting accounts, sharing to third parties, not giving permission to use, and so on.
The Ministry of Industry and Credit requested that the Section 58 APP should be completed before July 30, and if it is not completed by the deadline, the Ministry of Industry and Credit will organize the relevant disposal according to the regulations.
The Chinese New Economics Journal combed through the 58 APPs and found that they involved more than 10 US, Hong Kong and A-share listed companies.
For example, the company's products, which are owned by the US-listed company, have five problems: personal data collection, over-the-counter collection, sharing to third parties, forcing users to use the forwarding feature, and frequent application permissions.
The company was launched in November 2019 as the "first real estate brokerage company in the country with a SaaS (software serviced) model of the Internet industry", offering online solutions to many brokerage firms.
The company's website, which is based on the "Where to Buy" app, has been banned for a month, and the company has been banned for a year, with the company saying it is trying to prevent the company from selling the app to the public.
The cancellation is now considered to be convenient and account security, and has been changed to immediate effect, and is currently awaiting review.
A non-named cybersecurity expert told Xinhua's clients that the ministry has issued three such APP notifications this year, which violate users' rights and interests.
Among them, the personal information collected by the private, excessive access rights, account cancellation difficulty three problems often "manage" more than.
It can also be found from the communication that the current APP infringement of privacy is increasingly attracting attention.
On July 24, the Ministry of Industry and Communications issued a notice on the day of the 58 infringement of users' rights and interests APP, deploying a special operation to deepen the infringement of users' rights and interests APP.
The special reform will strengthen supervision and inspection in accordance with the regulations, urge relevant enterprises to strengthen the protection of personal information in APPs, and promptly correct outstanding problems such as the collection of illegal data, the use of user personal information and harassment of users, fraud and misleading users, and the failure to implement the responsibility of management of the application distribution platform, and purify the application space of APPs.
Lewis Family: John Lewis is a warrior "for the weakest"
John Lewis, a U.S. Congressman and civil rights activist, was remembered as a soldier who "fighted for the weakest" at a memorial service for him on Saturday (25 July).
Lewis' public memorial service began on Saturday in Alabama.
There were two memorial services on the first day.
At a public memorial service at Troy University in Alabama on Saturday, Lewis's five brothers and sisters and a niece spoke of him as a loving, fearless, and family-oriented man.
Lewis' youngest brother, Henry "Grant" Lewis, said at the meeting: "He has been dedicated to helping others all his life.
Samuel Lewis says his mother warned John, "Don't get in trouble, don't get in trouble.
John did not listen to his mother's warning, he added, "We all know that John always gets into trouble, always gets into trouble, but it's because he insists on doing the right thing, it's a good trouble."
Lewis's brothers and sisters reminded the memorial that John's most famous argument was to create "good trouble", that is, to raise a case for the sake of justice.
John applied to Troy University in his hometown of Troy, Alabama, but was turned down by the then-white school.
John Lewis, who preached the gospel to chickens on his farm as a child, eventually earned a degree in religion and philosophy from Fisk University.
Years later, the University of Troy awarded Lewis an honorary doctorate.
Congressman Doug Jones of Alabama said the current protesters were "peacefully, non-violently protesting," as Lewis had done in the Civil Rights Movement.
Jones said: "Even if President Trump beat a boatman with a rod and called all the protesters thugs, he was wrong.
The protesters are patriots who want America to move towards a more equal nation.
A six-day series of events in honor of Lewis culminated this week at a funeral in Georgia.
Lewis's coffin was placed on display Saturday at a public memorial service at Troy University to pay tribute to the civil rights movement's founder.
Later Saturday, a private ceremony honoring him was held in a small church in Selma, Alabama, followed by an open memorial service.
On Sunday, Lewis' body will pass through Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma.
In 1965, he and demonstrators demanding black voting rights were beaten by Alabama police in front of the bridge, who also threw tear gas at the demonstrators.
Lewis was nearly killed.
This day is known as Bloody Sunday.
Lewis' body will be transported to Montgomery, Alabama.
Mayor Steven Reed encouraged people to line up on the sidewalk and finish the last leg with Lewis.
Officials also require that the public wear masks and stay away from social activities.
Governor Kay Ivey ordered the flag to be lowered halfway to commemorate Lewis on Saturday and Sunday.
During the week-long memorial service, Lewis' body will be temporarily placed in the Alabama State Capitol in Montgomery, Georgia, and the United States Capitol in Washington, D.C., to be used as a memorial.
Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the House of Representatives, and Mitch McConnell, the leader of the Senate majority, announced last week that people could visit the Capitol on Monday and Tuesday to pay tribute to Lewis.
The public event to mourn Lewis will be held outdoors due to the coronary virus outbreak.

Recently, the Chinese President stressed during his visit to Jilin Province that he would like to strengthen the Party leadership, push for the Party organization to extend to the most basic level, improve the working system of the Party organization at the grassroots level and provide strong guarantees for the governance of urban and rural communities.
It is a fundamental requirement to carry out the work of grass-roots governance in a good direction by insisting on the Party's leadership and implementing it into all aspects of the fields and all links.
To raise the level of grassroots governance, we must insist on building the leadership of the Party, by strengthening political leadership, building battlefields, and consolidating the Red Force, and by promoting the transformation of the Party's political advantage, organizational advantage, and the advantage of the masses' work into governance advantage, we must pass on the Party's strength and ideas to the "neural tip" and "the last kilometer".
Focus on calcium rebuilding and strengthening political leadership.
To strengthen the political leadership of grassroots governance, it is necessary to implement the "calcium-filling casting soul" project well.
We should make it our first task to learn deeply and thoroughly about the Chinese Communist Party's new development policy, to make "not forgetting the original intention and remembering the mission" an eternal task in the construction of the Party and a lifelong task for Party members and cadres, to strengthen reading the original text and learning the principle of understanding, to promote the Party's innovation theory by continuously arming and strengthening its heart and mind through thematic training, batch training, discussion and exchange, holding lecture halls, and so on, and to promote Party cadres to further strengthen the "four consciousnesses", firmly "four self-confidence", achieve "two maintenances" and better perform their duties and responsibilities.
Through the combination of online and offline learning methods, we will broaden the channels of learning and education, and guide grassroots Party organizations and Party members to really integrate learning and education into their daily lives and grasp it regularly.
We should pay attention to practice and exercise, and in the process of resolving the key difficulties in the field of grass-roots governance, we should solve the troubles and disturbances that the masses are concerned about, and we should work hard to improve the Party's ability and ability.
Take up the standards and build a battle fortress.
The grassroots party organization is not only an important part of the grassroots governance system but also an important carrier to show the governance ability.
To promote the standardization of Party organization at the grassroots level, we should start by grasping the rules and regulations governing the work of Party branches, focusing on the weakening and virtualization of leadership in Party organizations, and establishing mechanisms for up-and-down linkage, innovative forms of branch formation, normalizing and redressing weaknesses and laxity, establishing and improving decision-making and deliberation mechanisms, and serving the masses, etc., to establish a solid foundation, filling the gaps and promoting development.
In rural areas, we should strengthen the standardization of Party organization at the village level, and in line with the standardization of Party branch building, standardize the form of organization, study activities and management mechanisms, and effectively promote the implementation of the "three-day-one-lesson" and thematic Party Day activities.
In the city, focus on the street community, explore the form of setting up innovative branch, focus on the weak areas, "blocking points" and "pain points", actively build the urban party-building alliance, so that the Party's work can be effectively covered.
At the same time, we should establish and improve the mechanism of grass-roots governance and governance, improve the decision-making and discussion mechanisms that are led by grass-roots party organizations, which discuss important matters together, resolve important matters together, discuss urgent matters together, and resolve difficult matters together, and improve the mechanism of contacting Party cadres to serve the masses.
Play a pioneering role and consolidate the red power.
The Party cadres at the grassroots level are the cornerstone of grassroots governance.
We will enhance the ability of grassroots governance, focus on improving the governance of the Party cadres at the grassroots level, and pay attention to the demonstration leadership role of the "red cells" in grassroots governance, and consolidate the red power at the forefront of connecting with and serving the masses.
We should make the improvement of governance capacity a compulsory lesson for the Party cadres at the grassroots level, constantly strengthen the hardening of thought, professional training and practical exercise, and develop the spirit of responsibility in our current posts and in urgent and dangerous tasks, thus laying solid foundations and contributing to the modernization of the state governance system and governance capacity.
We should carry out the "Community whistleblower and Party Members report" activities widely, and involve Party members in community construction, management and service by participating in thematic Party Day activities, contacting the people in difficulty, determining service projects, accepting small wishes, and making reasonable suggestions.
We should give full play to the role of the rural unemployed Party members, and by setting up pioneer guards for unemployed Party members and forming unemployed Party members' task forces, we should guide the broad masses of grassroots Party members to participate actively in all the work of fighting poverty, strengthening ecological construction, maintaining letters and visits, and banning the burning of straw, so as to better integrate the Red Force and serve the people.
The building is solid.
The grassroots party organization is the foundation of the ruling building.
Only by insisting on closer party-to-party relations and increasing the well-being of the people, and by taking the leadership of the Party as the fundamental way to promote the innovative development of grass-roots governance, can we lay a firm foundation for the grass-roots Party organizations to be able to pull out and to rise above, and for the Party cadres at the grass-roots level to be able to catch up and to rush up, so that grass-roots governance can be promoted with a "spirit", orderly, powerful and effective.

"Shanghai-Tibetan Railway to Reopen in 2019".
Xinhua News Agency (Xinning) reported by wire on July 25 (journalist Wang Jinjin) that the monitoring showed that Tibetan antelopes that had migrated to the Chonohu region of the Cocos Territory before were beginning to return to their original habitats with their young.
On 25 July, about 40 female Tibetan antelopes led by three Tibetan antelope cubs passed 3002 km of the Qinghai-Tibet Highway and the Qinghai-Tibet Railway Five-way Bridge.
Experts analyzed that in recent years, the number of young Tibetan antelopes in the return sheep herd accounted for one-quarter to one-fifth of the total number of Tibetan antelopes.
"In the early stages of the migration, Tibetan antelopes are at high risk of predation, so the number of young in the flock is relatively small, and there may even be no young," Lian Xinming, a deputy researcher at the Northwest Plateau Institute of Biology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said.
According to the National Park Service, the number of Tibetan antelope returns has been increasing year by year, with 4,860 in 2019, an increase of 338 from 2018.
"The return of Tibetan antelopes is expected to end in early September this year, and the number of returning Tibetan antelopes is still expected to increase," Lian said.
Tibetan antelope is a nationally protected animal.
At the end of May every year, Tibetan antelopes from the source of the Qinghai-Tibet Three Rivers, Qiangtang-Tibet, and Xinjiang Al Jinshan go to Lake Zhongno, in the heart of the Cocos Sea.
"The return of the Tibetan antelope is the process of female antelopes returning to their homeland after the hatching stage and bringing their young with them," said Wu Xiaomin, a researcher at the Shaanxi Provincial Animal Research Institute (NWRI) and a specialist in the conservation of Tibetan antelopes. "At first, the returning populations are relatively large, but later on, the antelopes will return to their homeland along different paths, depending on the geographical group," he said.
To ensure the safe return of Tibetan antelopes, the reporters learned that the Cocos Territory Administration of the Yangtze River Source Park of the Sanjiangyuan National Park Administration has arranged staff to carry out video surveillance and patrol in the main return area.
If a Tibetan antelope tries to cross the road, the rangers will first make temporary traffic controls to ensure that the sheep are safely through the wildlife passageway and that they are as unobstructed as possible on their way back.
So, how should we de-heat in everyday life?
Experts suggest that you avoid high temperatures as much as possible during the summer. It is best not to walk or work in the hot sun after mid-morning, because the sun is the strongest and the chances of heat stroke are higher.
If you have to go out at this time, you must do good protection work, such as shading the sun umbrella, wearing a sun hat, wearing sunglasses, and if conditions are best, apply sunscreen to protect against sunburn.
We should try to choose light-colored, breathable cotton, linen and silk fabrics, and wear less clothing of synthetic fibers, so as not to be able to dissipate heat in time when sweating a lot, causing heat stroke.
When you are in hot and humid weather, prepare enough water to drink, drink it in time, and do not wait until you are thirsty to drink water, because once you feel thirsty, you have no water, so you should drink water at a rate of 150 to 200 milliliters per drink, drink warm water, and do not drink ice water.
Depending on the temperature, the average person drinks 1.5 to 2 liters of water a day, while high-temperature workers drink 3 to 5 liters of water a day.
When sweating more, you can properly replenish some salt water to make up for the loss of salt in the body due to sweating.
In addition, the summer body is easily deprived of potassium, makes people feel tired and tired, potassium-containing tea is a great summer drink.
Eat plenty of watery fruits and vegetables in summer, such as raw vegetables, cucumbers, tomatoes, etc. Fresh fruits, such as peach, apricot, watermelon, melon, etc., with a water content of 80 to 90% can be used to replenish water; dairy products can both replenish water and meet the nutritional needs of the body.
In addition, people working in high temperature environments should be properly supplemented with drinks containing potassium, magnesium and other elements.
Summer is long and short, the temperature is high, the body metabolism is vigorous, the consumption is also large, easily feel tired.
Sufficient sleep can relax the brain and body systems, both for work and study, and as a measure to prevent heat stroke.
Experts say the best time to go to bed is between 10pm and 11pm, and the best time to get up is between 5.30am and 6.30pm.
When sleeping, be careful not to lie under the air conditioner outlet and electric fan, so as not to suffer from air conditioning disease and thermal injury.
Experts suggest that people who are outdoors or engaged in high-temperature work should carry ten drops of water, human dan, herbal medicines such as herbal medicines or herbal medicine pills, or place them near the workplace for use at any time to prevent heat stroke.

New drug to treat angioedema caused by new coronary artery at University of Australia - Official website
Researchers at Monash University in Australia are developing a new drug that could help prevent heart disease and stroke and hope to treat blood clots caused by the new coronary virus, Xinhua reported in Sydney on July 26.
Researchers found that an enzyme in the throat accelerates thrombocytosis before a heart attack or stroke.
They have developed a drug that temporarily inhibits platelet contraction, preventing blood vessel clogging and preventing heart disease and stroke.
The drug only suppresses platelet clotting when heart disease or stroke signs appear, the researchers said.
Since studies have shown that similar blood clots are one of the main causes of death in patients with new coronary heart disease, the researchers hope the drug will be used in the future to treat such patients.
The drug has been shown to work well in animal models and researchers are preparing for the next phase of human clinical trials.
The results were published in the American journal Science and Transformative Medicine.

The reporter saw the scene at the CPC Hami molten salt tower photothermal power plant in Mu Maohu town, Igo County, Hami City, Xinjiang on 25th.
"The so-called salt-melt tower photothermal power generation is the reflection of sunlight through the mirror to the heat-absorbing tower to form thermal energy, and then through traditional power generation technology to convert thermal energy into electricity.
Zhang Yong, deputy general manager of CPC Hami Solar Thermal Power Co., Ltd., said the design principle is similar to the solar cooker used in rural areas in northwest China, all the sunlight is collected.
The plant was completed in October 2017 and is located on 6,600 acres of land, with a total of 14,500 sunshades planned to be installed.
"The biggest advantage of solar power over conventional power generation is that it can store the heat that is collected and generate electricity at night.
The 13-hour heat storage system, which is configured in the project, will keep the generators running continuously and stable, without being affected by changes in light, and will also be able to participate in the peak adjustment of the grid quickly according to the peak demand, Mr. Zhang said.
The project will generate 198 million degrees of electricity per year, save more than 60,000 tons of standard coal per year, reduce emissions of more than 60 tons of sulphur dioxide, more than 60 tons of nitrogen oxides, about 20 tons of smoke and dust, and more than 1.5 million tons of carbon dioxide, providing clean energy for the local community.
In addition, there is another silver "Sunflower Field" in the Ishiguchi Photovoltaic Industrial Park in Hami City.
The Hammover Light Solar PV Power Plant covers more than 2,300 acres and has 714 generating units that are built to follow the sun's rotation, keeping the sun's light and the surface of the photovoltaic panel 90 degrees straight.
"We use double-axis tracking photovoltaic technology and through integrated control, all the power generation equipment can adjust the angle according to the height of the sun to maintain the power generation efficiency.
The power plant's director, Meng Qi, said the technology could increase the efficiency of photovoltaic generation by about 20 percent compared to conventional power generation in sunny weather.
In the first half of this year, the power station has generated more than 7 million degrees of electricity, which has supplemented the local demand for electricity.
The park is the largest single-unit photovoltaic industrial park in Xinjiang, and the most complete photovoltaic component type demonstration park, with 38 residential photovoltaic power generation projects, a total installed capacity of 820,000 kilowatts.
The total electricity generated in the first half of this year exceeded 110 million degrees, an increase of 6% compared to the same period in 2019.
Hami is one of the best areas in China for solar energy.
The average annual total solar radiation is over 6200 megajoules per square metre, and the total annual sunshine hours are about 3200 hours.
In recent years, the city has been developing photovoltaic industry, sowing "Sunflower Fields".
The city has built more than 2.5 million kilowatts of solar power, and the first half of this year the city's photovoltaic power output exceeded 1.4 billion degrees, about 14% year on year.
At present, Xinjiang has more than 330 photovoltaic power plants with a capacity of more than 10 million kilowatts.
The total annual capacity of photovoltaic power is expected to reach 15 billion degrees this year, replacing more than 6 million tons of standard coal.
Police report details of "Women Students Traveling to Qinghai Province" search and rescue work continues - Xinhua News Agency
Xinhua News Agency ( Xining Daily News, July 26 ) (journalist Wang Jin-jin Zhou Zheng) Recently, "a female university student went to Qinghai Gulmu tour after disconnection" caused concerns on netizens.

US media reveals the truth about the US's unjustified demand for China's closure of the consulate-general in Houston-Chinanews.net
| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |
The media has uncovered the truth about the US's unjustified demand that China close its consulate in Houston
On 24 April, the Chinese Foreign Ministry informed the US Embassy in China that China had decided to revoke the permit for the establishment and operation of the US Consulate General in Chengdu and made specific requests to the Consulate General to cease all operations and activities, as a countermeasure to the US abruptly requested China to close the Consulate General in Houston on 21 April.
The US government's actions have sparked widespread concern, and its political motivation has been questioned by outsiders and academics.
Why is China demanding the closure of the Consulate General?
It is not clear why the U.S. will choose the Chinese consulate in Houston, several foreign media said, but the purpose of the move, foreign media bluntly said: for the election.
CNN reported on 23 July that the move to ask China to close its consulate in Houston raised questions about its political motives.
The article said the US government's disastrous response to the new crown disease caused a relatively low turnout in the pre-election polls for President Donald Trump.
White House officials privately claim that China’s tough strategy is aimed at saving Trump’s approval ratings, as well as shifting responsibility for the White House’s failure to respond to the epidemic.
The article argued that the Chinese consulate in Houston was a "politically driven, very cautious" target chosen by the United States, which chose it "to create a hard line while avoiding the risk of major conflict".
The BBC also said that Trump believed that "playing the Chinese card has political advantages" as the US election season approached and the US economy was hit hard by the epidemic.
The current situation is a “ spiralling, confrontational struggle,” driven in part by the US government’s domestic considerations, which will only exacerbate tensions between the two countries.
CBS reported that Trump’s prospects for re-election were undermined by the outbreak, which he repeatedly blamed on China.
Almost every day, the US takes new action against Trump’s absurd rhetoric of “China exploiting America.”
"The Consulate General of Houston is very important in establishing ties between the two countries"
The Associated Press commented that the U.S. demand that China close its consulate in Houston has exacerbated tensions between the world's two largest economies.
If the Chinese Consulate-General in Houston were closed, China's citizens in the southern United States would face difficulties in obtaining consular services, as would American citizens seeking visas and other services, in addition to diplomatic implications.
A business group in Houston regretted the US demand for China to close its consulate in Houston, saying the consulate played an important role in establishing trade, investment and cultural ties between the two countries.
The Associated Press said this reflects the importance of China's economy.
The website of the US magazine Foreign Policy said the move was "part of a series of provocative moves that will only worsen US-China relations".
Jonathan Pollack, an expert on East Asia at the American think tank The Brookings Institution, quoted Reuters as saying that since the establishment of comprehensive diplomatic relations between the US and China in 1979, he could not think of any move that could be equated with the US action against China's consulate in Houston.
The South China Morning Post reported that the move was unprecedented in the more than 40 years of diplomatic relations between the two countries.
Analysts believe the move could cause lasting damage.
The Chinese Consulate-General in Houston was established in 1979, the first Chinese consulate to open in the United States.
Currently, China has one embassy and five consulates-general in the United States.

On the same day, the Russian North Sea, Baltic, Black Sea, Caspian and Pacific Fleets held parades in the waters where their bases were located, respectively, with a total of 15,000 troops, 219 ships of various types and 71 military aircraft participating.
Russian President Vladimir Putin attends a parade of the Baltic Fleet.
About 4,000 soldiers, 46 ships and more than 40 warplanes participated in the parade.
Putin first inspected the convoy in the waters of the Baltic naval base at Kronstadt.
He then sailed to the waters of the Neva River in the centre of Saint Petersburg and ashore to watch a parade on the Neva River.
Speaking at the parade, Putin said the modernization of the Russian Navy's equipment has continued in recent years and that the Navy will receive a total of about 40 new ships equipped with a unique high-speed ultrasonic strike system by 2020.
In addition, the Russian Navy General Commander Yevgeny Menov said in an interview with the Russian Defense Ministry's Red Star newspaper that the plan to build Russian ships has been effectively implemented, and the number of new ships to be received by the Russian Navy in 2020 is larger in recent years.
In 1696, Tsar Peter the Great began to form a naval fleet, which made a great contribution to the history of the Russian Navy.
The last Sunday of July is the Russian Navy Day.
In response to the new changes in the work of epidemic prevention and control, since July 17, Xinjiang trade unions at all levels have responded to the call of the Autonomous Region General Trade Union and actively participated in the work of epidemic prevention and control.
The Tianshan North-South Trade Union cadres, workers and labor models went into the street communities and the residents, carried out activities such as delivery of vegetables, medicine, disinfection and sterilization, and publicized knowledge of epidemic prevention, serving the workers and the people, and demonstrated the "hard core strength" of the trade union with practical actions.
A group of the General Union of the Tianshan District of Urumqi City sent a batch of urgently needed epidemic-prevention and control supplies to the workers at 12 quarantine points.
After the outbreak, the Tianshan District first put in more than $1.05 million, which was urgently allocated to 23 directly affiliated grassroots trade unions.
After receiving the notice of the company on the prevention and control of epidemics, Zhao Zhaoguo, deputy secretary of the Party Committee and chairman of the trade union of the Xinjiang Construction Workers' Union, asked Yi to stay on duty in the unit and to take care of the workers.
He delivers cooking utensils, food and daily necessities to the flatmates and newly employed workers, and organizes supplies for their daily living every two days.
"From July 21, the cadres and workers who have been fighting the 'epidemic' line will be checked and the way of ordering on-line and sending goods to the door of the merchants will be adopted, and the 704 workers and workers on the line in the Uruguay area will be the first to supplement the purchase of anti-epidemic supplies and living materials."
Xinjiang Transportation Union head told reporters that in the face of the sudden epidemic, they are doing their utmost to ensure the epidemic prevention and control services, steadily push forward all the work on transportation development, and create a strong atmosphere of a concerted fight against the "epidemic."
At the height of summer heat, trade unions at all levels are focusing on the front line workers in key areas to prevent and control the epidemic, and putting their concern for "cooling off" into practice.
On July 19, the Urumqi County General Union launched a "cooling off" campaign to the frontline workers in the prevention and control of the epidemic, and all the county police stations, card points and health systems received drinks, fruit and other comforts.
"Trade union cadres should further improve their political positions, strengthen their responsibility, and inspire their spirits with warmth and action.
We must give full play to the role of trade unions in organizing workers and uniting them, and do our best to protect the health and rights of the workers in the epidemic prevention and control service, and to send our love to the workers at the front line."
The head of the autonomous region's trade unions said.

Chinese Government is a firm defender of cyber security - China New Net
A spokesman for the Chinese embassy in the UK on July 25 answered a question about misrepresentations about cyber attacks, according to the website of the Chinese embassy in the UK.
The spokesman stressed that the Chinese government is a firm defender of cyber security and has always been resolutely opposed to and combating any form of cyber attacks and cyber crime.
According to media reports, Chinese-related hacker groups have disrupted a British company's network system, launched attacks on British and American technology companies that hold patent data, and invaded the networks of EU governments.
The spokesman said the Chinese government is a firm defender of cyber security and has always been resolute in opposing and fighting any form of cyber attacks and cyber crime.
The virtuality of network space is strong, traceability is difficult, and behaviors are diverse. When investigating and characterizing network events, we should provide sufficient evidence and not speculate without reason.
The spokesman said a series of incidents, including the "prism gate," had shown that the United States had been engaged in the world's largest network theft operation.
The maintenance of peace and stability in cyberspace is in the common interest of all countries.
The spokesman said China's achievements in technological innovation were not stolen or robbed, but rather were achieved through self-reliance and hard work.
In 2019, China submitted about 59,000 patent applications through the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT), with an annual growth rate of 10.6%, becoming the country with the highest number of international patent applications.
China has become a major power in innovation and intellectual property.
According to the People's Bank of China's Urumqi Central Branch, the first half of the year saw the increase in new loans to agriculture-related and small-scale enterprises in Xinjiang exceed the year-on-year increase in 2019.
In the first half of this year, the People's Bank of China's Uruguay Central Branch used various monetary policy instruments to guide the banking industry to increase lending and investment, providing adequate financial guarantees for the prevention and control of epidemics and reconstruction and restarting of production.
Most of the areas of free nucleic acid testing in Urumqi have been basically completed Secondary testing in high risk areas - China New Media
(Reporter: Zhao Yamin) Zhang Wei, director of the city's health and safety committee, said on July 26 that most of the free nucleic acid testing in the city has been basically completed, while reporting on the latest epidemic and the testing of nucleic acid.
The State Council's expert group and experts from the autonomous regions and the city of Urumqi are making further assessments of the epidemic situation based on the results of nucleic acid testing and epidemiological investigations.
Xinjiang's Uighur Autonomous Region Information Office held a press conference on 26th to report on the epidemic and prevention and control situation in Xinjiang.
He said 22 new confirmed cases of new coronary pneumonia (of which 5 were confirmed as asymptomatic) and 38 asymptomatic cases were reported in Urumqi from 0:00 to 00:00 on July 25.
As of 24 July, there were 135 confirmed cases and 147 asymptomatic cases in Urumqi.
The 25th day of the new asymptomatic infections are also basically through the city free nucleic acid test, active screening.
Most of the free nucleic acid testing in the city of Urumqi has been basically completed, Zhang Wei, director of the city's health and safety committee, said on Sunday.
He added that, from experience in other parts of the country, there are many factors that influence the results of nucleic acid testing, such as the sensitivity of the test reagents, the time of infection and detoxification of the test subjects, the cooperation of the test subjects when samples are collected (the lack of cooperation may cause the samples not to be taken in place), the testing environment, the proficiency of the test subjects.
For various reasons, nucleic acid testing also produces false negative results.
The false negative is a test that indicates that the tested person is indeed infected, but the test results for nucleic acid are negative.
In addition, for persons who have had close contact with confirmed cases and suspected cases, it usually takes two nucleic acid tests to exclude.
For people who have been to high-risk areas, if fever and respiratory symptoms occur, a negative nucleic acid test may be false negative, so it also requires two nucleic acid tests to rule out.
In view of the above, he said, for the health of the people of all ethnic groups in the city, from today, the city of Urumqi will conduct a second free nucleic acid test in key areas such as Tianshan District, Shai Baq District, and also carry out "checking for residual leaks".
It is reported that Tianshan and Shai Baq are high-risk areas.

The Shanghai International Film Festival is a great industry confidence booster
The Shanghai International Film and Television Festival (SIFF) 2020, held in the context of strict anti-epidemic measures, opened the 23rd Shanghai International Film Festival yesterday with an industry summit forum on "completely striving for a healthy life and building a new era of dreams".
As the first international film and television festival since the global epidemic spreads and our country normalizes the epidemic prevention and control, this year's Shanghai International Film Festival is of great significance.
On the basis of the normalization of the epidemic prevention and control, the Shanghai International Film and Television Festival is both a demonstration of confidence and a declaration of determination – our determination to overcome the epidemic, to hold people’s festivals, to build a global film and television production center, and to launch the Shanghai Culture brand remains unchanged.
Each year, the Shanghai International Film Festival is always innovative and aggressive, and it is always a new beginning.
Therefore, we need to take every step to satisfy the people's spiritual life and service the development of the film and television industry.
This year is even more so.
In order to cherish the difficult situation of epidemic prevention and control, the Shanghai International Film Festival, on the one hand, strictly observes the requirements of epidemic prevention and control, implements the epidemic prevention and control measures in detail; on the other hand, with the vision of gathering wisdom for Chinese film creation, satisfying the demand of movie fans, opens up online and offline multi-platform activities.
From the opening day, from the underground cinema to the industry forum, the festival related activities are strictly implemented related anti-epidemic policies.
The forum is controlled by 50 people, and the seating is separated from the audience and the attendance rate is strictly controlled by 30 percent.
As the organizing committee of the festival has maintained, in any case, "putting the safety of life and health of the people first" are the main premises.
The activities on the line were greatly streamlined, and the "cloud" was a lot of activity.
To implement the important idea of "People's City for People, People's City for People," as a festival for the people, this year's Shanghai International Film Festival will innovate and seek transformation, using online "Cloud Show" and master class "Cloud Sharing" initiatives to meet the diverse needs of film fans.
On the opening day, the festival’s official partners, MiGov Video and Oriental Pearl 100TV, each gave back to fans a number of “Broadway” films, “Up the Cloud.”
On that night, the Jinzhu Opening Forum and the Jia Zhang Ke Master Class were also launched on platforms such as Zhong Video, Learn Stronger Country, and Wenhui App, allowing people to watch the latest trends in Chinese films from home.
At the opening forum yesterday, Yan Xiaoming, a member of the Central Radio and Television Broadcasting Corporation's Party Group and deputy director, gave a speech and announced the opening of the festival.
White House Epidemic Expert: Cautionary Optimism for Vaccine Development in Early 2021
Mr Foggy made the statement on 25 September at a web video conference hosted by the International Leadership Foundation.
He reminded that it is not clear how the new crown outbreak will develop in the fall and winter, nor what the final impact of the outbreak will be, and that "the only way to end it is for each of us to choose to be part of the solution".
According to data from Johns Hopkins University, by 2100 hours on 25 June, 417.6 million new coronary heart disease cases had been diagnosed in the United States, and 14.6 million deaths had occurred.
Mr Foggy said some parts of the U.S. are struggling to cope with the resurgence of the epidemic.
Although epidemics vary from place to place and require tailored responses, a diversified strategy does not mean that there are no close links between regions.
The epidemic in one area will eventually affect the others.
"This is not a time for complacency," said Fogg. "We have not finished our work, we must intensify our efforts and we must be vigilant about the uncertainties ahead.
The new crown epidemic in the United States has not yet reached its peak, said Ho Dai-ichi, a Chinese-American medical expert and founder of the cocktail cure for AIDS.
"We must do our part to slow down the spread of the virus," he said.
Ho called for the public to use its own practical actions to buy time for scientists to accelerate the development of new crown-treatment drugs and vaccines.
The International Leadership Foundation is a non-profit organization dedicated to promoting international exchange in the United States and Asia-Pacific. Its mission is to promote the status of Asian Americans and foster international youth leaders.
On the same day, the U.S. Transportation Secretary Zhao Xiaolan, U.S. Representative Meng Zhaowen and the founding president of the International Leaders Foundation Dong Jiling, etc.
They paid special tribute to Asian-American health workers and volunteers on the front lines of the epidemic, and called on the American public to continue to adhere to epidemic prevention guidelines such as "social distance" to curb the spread of the disease.

The city of Dalian also decided to further expand the scope of medical observation of the detainees in the central isolation, and to conduct 14 days of medical observation of the positive detainees (including cases and asymptomatic infections) and close contacts of the close contacts, and at least two tests of the nucleic acid.
The airport and railway stations in Dalian issued notices on 25th, and the city personnel in principle did not need to leave the station, and if they did, they had to have negative certificates of nitric acid testing within 7 days; the bus and passenger terminal in Dalian suspended all the city's routes from 12 o'clock on 25th, and the exact time of resumption was notified separately.
Brazilian study shows that hydrochlorobenzene is ineffective in the treatment of mild-to-moderate neo-Cranial pneumonia-CNS
A Brazilian study has shown that hydrochlorobenzene is not effective in patients with mild to moderate new coronary pneumonia.
The study was published in the New England Journal of Medicine.
The researchers divided 667 patients from 55 hospitals across the country into three groups and conducted clinical trials comparing the effects of hydrochlorobenzene alone or in combination with other antibiotics, achimycin, to see if it could improve the condition of mild and moderate patients with new coronary pneumonia.
The results showed that hydrochlorobenzene not only had no therapeutic effect but could cause harmful side effects on the organs.
The study was carried out by several Brazilian authoritative hospitals, such as Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, Hospital for Cardiac Disease (HCor), Hospital Sírio-Libanês, and others, in collaboration with the Brazilian Clinical Research Institute (BCRI) and the Brazilian Network for Critical Care Research (BRICNet).
Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva announced on social media that his country's fourth nucleic acid test was negative.
During the infection, Bosonaro was given hydrochloroquine and was actively promoted several times.

"The Fourth Round of App Governance in China: Protecting Personal Information Security".
The government has launched a campaign to control the illegal collection and use of personal information in 2020, focusing on cracking down on the strong public concerns about the private uploading of personal information from behind the scenes, Xinhua news agency reported on July 25 (reporters Yu Junjie and Chen Aiping) from the State Net Agency.
It is reported that this round of app management work is carried out by the State Network Communications Office, the Ministry of Labor and Communications, the Ministry of Public Security, and the State Administration of Market Supervision in four departments.
Last year, the special governance working group, composed of four departments, received more than 12,000 articles of information that users could effectively report, conducted checks on more than 2,300 apps, and took punitive measures such as public exposure, interviews and removal of the 260 apps that had large user sizes and outstanding problems.
According to the head of the National Network of Correspondents Office, the number of apps has exceeded 5 million, and the problem of illegally collecting and using personal information has not been solved at all.
In 2020, the governance will be further strengthened, and based on App verification, the governance scope will be further expanded to SDK (software development toolkit) and small programs, etc.
The working group will conduct a thematic study and in-depth testing on issues such as the collection of personal biometric information and the use of non-standardized and sensitive permissions for abuse of apps, focusing on back-end permission abuse such as recording and photography.

In recent years, the demand for red tourism has been increasing gradually.
However, the development of red tourism industry is also facing the difficulties of younger groups, homogenization of tourist projects, and single channel of commercialization.

The festival uses the popular "county (district) mayor + professional anchor special presentation" method to promote the Red Travel special products, using 5G technology to provide real-time viewing and intelligent city demonstration services to promote the Red Travel attractions, are all attempts to put the intelligent wings for the Red Tourism, expecting Hunan red tourism to become more and more red.
US-China Trade Representative Meets in August
China's trade negotiating team chief, Vice Premier Liu He, and the joint US team leader and trade representative, Lai Haizhe, are expected to hold formal talks in August to assess the two sides' implementation of the first-stage trade agreement with the United States, the South China Morning Post quoted an anonymous person familiar with the matter as saying on Sunday.
The report said that although China has increased its purchases of U.S. agricultural products substantially in the past few months, the amount of Chinese purchases is still a long way from the amount promised in the trade agreement, due to factors such as the outbreak of the new crop virus.
Analysts say the recent closure of US and Chinese consulates, coupled with other disputes, could undermine any progress in trade.
The first-stage trade agreement between China and the United States will come into effect one month after its signing on January 15. The agreement stipulates that a high-level trade framework group of the two sides should meet every six months.
The meeting will be an "important turning point" for both sides to assess the progress of the agreement, people familiar with the matter said.
But the man also said that if tensions between the US and China cause a lack of willingness to talk at this time, the two sides might agree to meet on a May 8 telephone meeting between Mr. Lai and Mr. Liu, which meets the terms of the trade agreement's six-monthly meeting.
Since this year, Sino-US relations have deteriorated rapidly, with disputes over the origin of the new crown virus, trade, Hong Kong, Xinjiang, the South China Sea and ideology among other issues.
US President Donald Trump, who boasted earlier this year of his achievements in the first-stage agreement, has recently changed his mind.
"This trade deal means less to me now than it did when it was made," he told reporters at the White House on 23 May, adding that China has recently bought a record number of US corns and soybeans on a daily basis.
An anonymous Beijing government adviser also said that the new round of trade talks was unlikely to take place because of the poor US-China relationship.
But he revealed that China’s economic and trade-related units were still meeting on the 23rd to discuss a range of issues, including how to increase imports from the US. “We have done our best to buy, so any additional purchases will be difficult.”
'It's more important than ever to keep the first-stage agreement alive,' said Vice President of the US-China National Trade Commission, Peter Penjening, who noted that China has made progress this year in further opening up financial markets to US companies.
"Talking is better than not talking, although it may be considered routine," said analyst Plenum, an independent research firm.
Xinhua News Agency (newspaper: Wei Yukun) reported by wire on July 26 from the Ministry of Emergency Management that the Ministry of Defense and Emergency Management will urgently transport 1.35 million knitted bags, 1.2 million knitted cloths and 1.3 million earthwork cloths from the Central Reserve Bureau of Food and Materials to Anhui Province to support the relief efforts of the province in the flood fighting.
According to the relevant head of the Ministry of Emergency Management, the current fluctuation of high water levels in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River and the Huai River basin, the "3rd flood of the Yangtze River 2020" on 26th in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, local risks increased.
The weather department expects heavy rainfall in Chongqing, Guizhou and the lower and middle reaches of the Yangtze River in the next three days, and flood prevention remains a serious and complex issue.
Since the flood, the Ministry of Emergency Management has deployed a national comprehensive fire and rescue team to advance specialized rescue forces in key flood-prevention areas.They have participated in 10,364 rescues of various types, including more than 130,000 combatants, 17,778 fire trucks and 11,887 boats, rescued 37,777 people in distress and evacuated and transferred more than 170,000 people in distress.
NASDAQ China Chief Representative Yusheng Hao: Now is the best time for Chinese companies to go to the U.S. for IPOs-Economic Watch-Specialized Financial News Website
China's stock market has been under pressure to back up its Chinese-listed stocks, with Netease and jingjing, among others, recently launching a bid to return to Hong Kong, due to tougher regulation of Chinese-listed stocks in the US, along with long-term valuation pressures, due to the faked coffee case of Ruikou.
And recently shell, ideal car and other companies, the enthusiasm to list in the United States rose.
Is this the best time for Chinese companies to go public in the US amid the epidemic and the Chinese stock market crisis?
"As far as the recent IPOs and the companies that are going to be listed in the US are concerned, the IPOs in the US have not been affected in any way, but the market is very good, and even now is the best time for Chinese companies to go to the US for IPOs in the last 10 years.
NASDAQ China Chief Representative Hao Yu-shing said at the "2020 Leaders' Summit of Listed Companies" held by Snowball.
In April, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Public Company Accounting Regulatory Commission (PCAOB) released a Statement on the Importance of Audit Quality and Regulatory Access to Audit and Other International Information – A Discussion on Current Information Access Challenges for US Listed Companies with Large Businesses in China.
The statement said that, despite significant increases in international cooperation and coordination in recent years, U.S. regulatory access to information remains problematic and that the SEC and PCAOB still face legal and practical challenges; in contrast, the PCAOB website lists listed companies with audit obstacles in detail, along with their auditing agencies, and a large number of listed companies.
In addition, in May, the Senate passed the Foreign Companies Accountability Act, which requires additional disclosure of information about foreign companies listed in the US.
In the eyes of Mr. Hao, the crisis in the Chinese stock market has not affected investors' appetite.
"The news scared everyone when it came out, and everyone was asking about the future of not being able to go public in the U.S., but then we found out that these questions were not on the investors side, that they might ask about them in their recent IPO tour of the U.S., and that they might even become standardized questions, but that they weren't seen as the key to investing in a Chinese company or not.
I suggest that we look at the current situation with a normal heart.
Of course, this may seem like the worst case in two years, but it hasn't affected investor appetite.
So the IPO boom will continue from now until the end of this year or before the U.S. elections.
On May 9, Jinshan Yun was officially listed on Nasdaq in the United States, becoming the first Chinese company to go to the US IPO after the outbreak.
"The listing of Jinshan Yun gives a lot of confidence to the Chinese companies that are preparing for IPOs later on.
"Hoo-Yung-Sheng says.
The first half of this year saw a total of 20 Chinese companies IPO in the US, up 17.6% from the same period last year, according to the China Overview of Shares data released by Snowball.
According to Mr. Hao, Chinese companies that go to IPO in the first half of this year are of high quality, and those with a solid basic and growth characteristics will be more attractive to investors.
In the short, medium and long term, Mr. Hao remains optimistic about Ming Chinese's IPO in the U.S.
In the short term, the IPO boom is still going on; in the medium term, Chinese companies have more options, A-shares, Hong Kong stocks, US stocks, and people will consider the U.S. election and the relationship between China and the U.S. as factors in the choice of market and timing; in the long term, everything will return to normal, market fluctuations are cyclical, both political and economic cycles, and eventually they will return to normal, the stock market has always been volatile.
"There are a lot of uncertainties this year, but for quality companies, whether the market is good or bad, as long as they are solid and have the growth that investors can see, the other factors are relatively minor, and investors need to invest in good Chinese companies," Mr. Hao said.

People's Daily Commentator: Focus on doing your own thing and building new advantages for future development - On learning to implement the keynote speech by the President-in-Office at the Entrepreneur Forum - Xinhua News Agency
Xinhua, July 25, 2007 People's Daily, July 26, 2007 Focus on your own business and build new advantages for future development
At present, the global epidemic situation and the world economic situation are still severe and complex, and the challenges facing our country's development are unprecedented.
Maintaining strategic strength, enhancing confidence in winning and concentrating on doing our own thing are the keys to meeting all kinds of risk challenges.
At the recent entrepreneurs' symposium, the Chinese President stressed that in the current external environment of rising protectionism, sluggish world economy and shrinking global markets, we must concentrate our efforts to do our own thing, give full play to the advantages of the domestic super-large market, gradually form a new development pattern with the domestic large-scale cycle as the main body and the domestic international dual cycle mutually promoted, upgrade the modernization level of the chain of industries supply chain, vigorously promote scientific and technological innovation, accelerate the key core technology offensive, and build new advantages for future development.
The seeker of the potential, the master of the potential wins.
In the external environment of the deep development of economic globalization, market and resources "without the two heads" play an important role in the rapid development of China.
Now, the world is undergoing profound changes, facing more instability and uncertainty, and economic globalization is facing headwinds and reversals.
One of the most important aspects of preparing for the long-term response to the changes in the external environment and preparing for the work to push our economy to break through the winds and to make steady progress is to make the expansion and meeting of domestic demand the strategic base of development, to give full play to our own advantages, to add impetus to our economic development through the prosperity of our domestic economy and the smooth passage of the domestic cycle, and to promote the world economic recovery.
We should realize that building a complete system of domestic demand is related to the long-term development and long-term security of our country.
The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China has clearly stated the timeliness and urged the firm implementation of the strategy of expanding domestic demand, which is the need to respond to the impact of the epidemic, to maintain the long-term and sustainable healthy development of our economy, and to meet the people's growing need for a better life.
The advantage of a large economy is internal recycling.
China has the world's most complete and largest industrial system, strong production capacity and perfect supporting capacity, more than 100 million market entities and more than 170 million people with higher education or various professional skills, and an ultra-large domestic demand market of 1.4 billion people, including more than 400 million middle-income groups.
The basic socialist economic systems such as the socialist market economy system, which have the public ownership system as their main subject and various ownership systems as their common development, and which have the distribution of labor as their main subject and various distribution methods coexist, can not only stimulate the vitality of various market subjects, liberate and develop social productivity, but also promote efficiency and fair organic unification and achieve constant common prosperity.
We should firmly grasp the strategic basis of expanding domestic demand, make the production, distribution and circulation of all the links more rely on the domestic market to achieve a virtuous cycle, clarify the strategic direction of supply-side structural reform, and promote a dynamic balance between total supply and total demand at a higher level.
We must accelerate the construction of a complete system of domestic demand, vigorously promote scientific and technological innovation and other innovations in all aspects, accelerate the advancement of strategic emerging industries such as the digital economy, intelligent manufacturing, life and health, and new materials, and form more new growth points and growth poles, and gradually form a new development pattern that is driven by the domestic large-scale cycle and promoted by the domestic and international dual cycles.
Openness brings progress, but closedness is bound to lag behind.
The Chinese President has repeatedly stressed that China's open door will not close, but only the bigger the door.
Taking the domestic cycle as the main subject, we should not close the door to close the operation, but achieve stronger and more sustainable development by making better connection between domestic and international markets, making better use of both domestic and international markets and resources.
At the same time, expanding domestic demand and expanding openness are not contradictory.The smoother the domestic cycle, the more favorable it is to construct a new open pattern and the more favorable it is to form new advantages in participating in international cooperation and competition.
Although the international trend of protectionism is rising, we should stand on the right side of history, insist on deepening reform, expanding openness, strengthening open cooperation in the field of science and technology, promoting the construction of an open world economy and building a community of human destiny.
The Chinese nation has experienced many hardships in its history, but has never been crushed. Instead, it has grown up and risen from the hardships with more courage.
On the way forward, we must have the strong leadership of the Central Committee of the Party, with Comrade Xi Jinping as its core, the remarkable advantages of the socialist system with Chinese characteristics, the strong mobilization capability and comprehensive strength, and the unity and struggle of the entire Party and the entire army of the people of all ethnic groups.
The balance of the proceeds of the "90 after" instead of "retaliation" deposit money?
As the balance of payments declined, the post-1990s did not just run away from the balance of payments, but began to save money in retaliation.
The China New Economic Research Institute's (CNES) joint report on saving after 90 (2020 edition) shows that people in the first half of the 1990s have become more savvy: the amount of money saved per capita has grown by nearly 40% since 2019.
Interestingly, people tend to start saving after 90 with a small amount of money, with 60% averaging less than $20 per saved
The use of surplus treasure to save money has also become a habit in the '90s.
Of the $700 million in subscribers, $134 million are “after 90.”
China has 174 million post-90s, meaning that about three out of every four post-90s people in the country are saving with their savings.
The 7-day annualized yields of such funds as Yue Bao have fallen from above 2% at the beginning of the year to around 1.5%.
Even so, it has not affected the pace of saving after the 1990s.
In the context of the increase of the "saving effect" of the balance, many young people who used to use the balance also directly converted to "basic people".
As of July 13, the new "basic" people on the payroll nearly doubled year-on-year, and more and more young people are taking the "advanced" path in their finances, according to Payroll data.
Some analysts believe the money flowing into the stock market from the surplus is also a significant reason for the clear decline in the money funds' share in June.
The report also found that girls were more likely to save more money after 90, averaging 20 per cent more than boys; 60 per cent of users of the PayPal platform who held funds were men, and women were more likely to choose more secure ways of managing their finances than men.
What is the plan after 90 after saving money?
The PayPal data show that the '90s have a habit of saving money for a purpose, with travel being the most popular savings goal.
Many post-epidemic "90s" savings were made to prepare for post-epidemic travel; the cinemas resumed operations, providing a new way to shift from saving to spending.

As of the afternoon of the same day, PCOO had tested positive for 13 staff members, three of whom had been positive, and one died while still receiving treatment.
On 24 April, after contact with an infected PCOO employee, Andanar and 49 other PCOO employees were tested for new coronary pneumonia.
The report released on 25 April showed that 10 of the staff had tested positive.
PCOO Deputy Minister of Administration and Legal Affairs Marvin Gatpayat said the department's new administration building in the Presidential Palace was scheduled to be reopened on the day of President Duterte's fifth State of the Union Address on 27 September.
On the same day, Martin Andanar assured the public that the PCOO would continue to fulfill its responsibilities to the Filipino people, ensure timely and important information to the public, and strengthen contact tracing and detection to prevent further spread of the new CJD virus among PCOO staff, and prayed for the rapid recovery of the positive staff.

"France to increase military space deployment".
France will add hundreds of millions of euros to its space defense budget, France’s defense minister, France’s François Pali, said on Thursday, to develop a space military force to guard against “unfriendly actions” by other countries in outer space.
Parry told the Provence newspaper that the budget for France's space military project spending for the period 2019–2025 would increase from €3.6 billion ($4.2 billion) to €4.3 billion ($5.0 billion) from the previous estimate.
Under the French Military Planning Act 2019–2025, approved by the French Parliament in 2018, France is expected to upgrade its existing observation and communication satellites, launch three electromagnetic reconnaissance satellites, and upgrade its space surveillance radar.
French President Emmanuel Macron announced last July that the French Air Force would establish a military space command and an "Air and Space Force".
Parry said she would officially announce the formation of the space force when she visited a military school in the Provence region of Salon later that day.
Parry said the space force is part of the Air Force and will have 500 personnel by 2025.
"Space was once thought to serve the common interests of science, and that idea is no longer valid. Today, it is a place where nations compete for global hegemony," she said.
Parry reiterated Macron's earlier statement that the French had no intention of launching an arms race.
"We are not engaged in an arms race, but it is my responsibility to fully identify the threats we may face.
Parry recalled the surveillance of a French-Italian military satellite in 2017.
She said the spy was a Russian satellite.
The Russians denied this claim.
Parry said France would soon have small patrol satellites that could detect and track down "the moles behind those unfriendly actions".
French media have attributed France’s quest for a space force to US President Donald Trump’s February request to the US Department of Defense to draft a space force bill.
Trump signed the Defense Authorization Act last December, approving the creation of the US’s sixth-largest military, the Space Force.
Some experts fear that the US moves have accelerated the pace of US space militarization and could trigger a new space arms race.

Shaanxi: Solving the Problem of Helping People after Relocation to Avoid People Running "Double Headed"
CCTV News: Aiming at the follow-up difficulties encountered by migrants moving to integrate into local life, Ankang Langao County, Shaanxi Province, based on local innovations to build "good neighbors' houses", guides the villagers moving to the citizens to change, achieve stable, rapid integration, and can become rich.
Langao County is located in the Qinba Mountains, where nearly one-third of the population has moved out of the mountains through immigration.
The 39-year-old Changjiang moved from the village of Zhongwu in Yanmen Town in Langao County to the community of Mingzhu in Democracy Town.
He took his old-age insurance card to the community’s “good-neighborhood home,” where he completed his old-age insurance this year in less than two minutes.
Earlier this year, Langao County incorporated all the business of employment, civil affairs, health care and other services into its administration by building a "good-neighbourly home," and the relocated people could handle business at their doorstep.
In the Pearl community, 305 residents have been recruited to work in local community factories through the Good Neighborhood Homes job posting.
At present, more than 31 hundred households in Langao County have been resettled in community factories, which can provide employment for 2,598 people.
Shared accommodation market to warm up from March - China New Media
China's share-sharing market fell 72.1% year-on-year in the first five months of 2020, according to China's Shared Accommodation Development Report 2020 (the Report), released by the China Center for Sharing Economics (CCSE), a national information center, the Xinhua News Agency (Xinhua News Agency).
However, the share accommodation market has been warming since March, with market volumes, orders and visitors gradually recovering.
The report said the share accommodation market had seen a sharp decline in transactions, partly due to a sharp decline in demand for travel accommodation under epidemic prevention and control, with order volumes falling sharply, total orders for the previous five months down 65% and the number of guests receiving accommodation down 63 per cent.
However, the market volumes in March, April and May rose by 78 per cent, 99 per cent and 35 per cent, respectively, the orders volumes rose by 141 per cent, 152 per cent and 50 per cent, and the customer sub-volumes rose by 81 per cent, 112 per cent and 28 per cent, respectively.
The report notes that the share-housing industry has been growing for a long time, but there are still many uncertainties in the near future.
On the one hand, we need to implement the policies already adopted in advance, further strengthen the policy coherence and focus on creating a better business environment, and on the other hand, we need to further stimulate consumer demand, enrich the supply of tourist accommodation services, innovative service methods and strengthen the cooperation between the government and platform enterprises, and further increase the policy guidance and support, Yu Fengxia, deputy director of the National Information Center for Sharing Economic Research, told the Workers Daily.
A new outbreak of plague has killed 21 people at a plant in La Sarro Cárdenas, Mexico, the world's largest steelmaker, Anselmitas, Reuters reported.
It was reported that the secretary-general of the local chapter of the Mexican Mining and Metallurgical Workers' Union, José Socorro, said the dead included workers, contractors and suppliers of the factory.
Solorio said 21 people have died at the plant since April, nine of them union members.
Because the factory has taken strict hygiene measures, workers are likely to be infected outside the factory.
According to the union, the factory has more than 7,000 employees.
As of July 25, Mexico had more than 385,000 confirmed cases and more than 40,000 deaths, making it the fourth-highest-ranked country in the world for new coronary deaths.
(Yong Fushan, Zhang Shushan, Xu Jing-ching) On July 25, the Chinese Navy Medical University signed a contract with the University of Xiamen's Zhongshan Hospital for Angio-vascular Surgery to establish a joint center to promote exchange and cooperation in the field of angio-vascular surgery, especially in the acute aortic disease.
The hospitals will establish a long-distance consultation service, develop treatment plans with Changhai Hospital, send trained personnel for further training, and jointly conduct weekly surgical technology exchange and classroom visits. For complicated cases, Changhai experts can be invited to perform surgery according to patients' needs, thus ensuring that patients in southwest Minnan can enjoy the best medical resources in China without having to travel to a province, the hospital said.
The two hospitals will also work together to carry out innovative surgical research, aortic diseases and early screening, etc.
The Aortic Seminar, sponsored by Beijing Health Promotion Association and sponsored by Xiamen University's Zhongshan Hospital, was held in Xiamen on the same day.
The two famous hospitals in Shanghai and Xia held a signing ceremony of the Angio-Surgical Collaboration Center at the same time, and announced that they had formed a collaborative unit to jointly improve the treatment of angio-surgical-related diseases in the southwest of Minnan.
The Angio-vascular Surgery Department of Shanghai Changhai Hospital is the only Angio-vascular Surgery Institute in the army and the only Clinical Medical Center for Diseases of the Angio-vascular System in Shanghai. It is also the first major department of Angio-vascular Surgery in China.
Professor Huang Xiaojin, Director of Angiovascular Surgery, Zhongshan Hospital, Xiamen University, was interviewed by the media.
The first hospital in the United States to offer a full-service medical care service to the general public, the University of California, Berkeley Hospital, was established in 2018 to provide a full-service medical care service to the general public.
In the treatment of aortic diseases, besides the treatment of dissecting aneurysms and aortic aneurysms, we have extensive experience in the diagnosis of ruptured aneurysms.
"The history of vascular surgery at Xiamen University's Zhongshan Hospital has been a long one.The range, difficulty and complexity of the operations are very outstanding in this region.We have established a collaborative center to conduct all-round cooperation in medicine, teaching and research in addition to the aorta, lower extremity and cervical arteries," he said.
Professor Feng Rui, vice director of vascular surgery at Shanghai Changhai Hospital, said.
In 2018, the University of Xiamen's Zhongshan Hospital and Shanghai Changhai Hospital signed a contract to establish a digestive medicine "Li Zhaoxing Namiang Medical Studio".
The director of the department, Professor Huang Xiaojin, told reporters on CNN that the department also has long-standing ties with Changhai Hospital.
He said the hospital would regularly invite Shanghai experts to Xiamen to conduct exchanges of surgical techniques, conduct classroom visits, discuss suspected cases, and further develop remote consultations.
The reporters learned that vascular disease is the first major cause of death in China. The aorta, as the main artery of all organs of the human body, plays an important role from the heart to the whole body.
The aorta is the largest section of the body, with a diameter of up to 4 cm, and is at high risk of bleeding if an aneurysm develops, ruptures, or if the endothelium ruptures, causing a septum.
In recent years, with the change of people's lifestyle and the acceleration of the pace of life, China has become the world's largest country for high blood pressure, and aortic diseases have increased accordingly. Today, with the development of surgical technology and industrial materials, the treatment of aortic diseases is continuously developing in the direction of minimally invasive, rapid and efficient.
Doctors can achieve good results by piercing the leg and placing a stent in the aorta to "translate" the blood flow, thus avoiding impact on an aneurysm or ruptured septum, and some operations even require local anesthesia.
The seminar invited more than 10 experts from China to discuss the new advances in the treatment of aortic diseases, and held a conference salon to conduct advanced technology training and discuss cases of suspected aortic diseases.
The reporters learned that with the development of surgical technology and industrial materials, the treatment of aortic diseases is continuously developing in the direction of micro-injury, rapid and efficient.

(Han Lu)A reporter from the Chengdu Railway Corporation Ltd. was informed on July 26 that the 13.9 kilometer long Zheng Wan High-Speed Railway Little Three Gorges Tunnel will pass through the entire line on the day.
It is understood that the Xiao Three Gorges Tunnel is not only the longest high-speed tunnel in the Three Gorges Reservoir Area, but also the longest single-hole double-track high-speed tunnel designed to reach 350 km/h in the current domestic projects under construction.
The Zheng Wan High-Speed Railway (Zheng Wan HSR) is located in Henan, Hubei, and Chongqing, and connects Beijing-Guangzhou and Xulan high-speed railways in northern Zhengzhou, and connects Yunnan-Zhoushan high-speed railway in southern Manchuria to Chongqing.
The entire route of the Zheng Wan high-speed railway is crossed by the Little Three Gorges Tunnel on 26th.
The picture shows the scene.
The new high-speed railway line from Zhengzhou, Henan Province, to the southwest, via Pingdingshan, Nanyang, Xiangyang, Hubei Province to Wanzhou, Chongqing, is about 818 km long, with a design speed of 350 km/h, and about 184 km within Chongqing.
The first phase of the project, from Zhengzhou to Xiangyang, was completed on December 1, 2019, and construction of the Chongqing section is underway.
The newly constructed railway line is located at the junction of the two main highways, the railway line from the town of Chongqing to the town of Wushan, and is approximately 18.9 km long and 890 m deep.
Construction of the tunnel began in February 2017 and the line will be completed on 26 July 2020.
According to Wang Guojun, the head of the design of the Zheng Wan High-Speed Tunnel, China Central Railway Secondary School Engineering Group Co., Ltd., the site of the Xiao Three Gorges Tunnel is a high-risk tunnel of Class I, with very complex geological conditions and risks of rock dissolution, mudslides, soft rock deformation, and difficulty in tunnel design and construction.
"In the course of the project construction, we used geological survey, physical exploration and drilling methods to predict the geology of the tunnels, and adopted special design schemes for more than 30 types of tunnels. We designed and built 24m long bridges, crossed tunnels with longitudinal lengths of more than 10m and depths of more than 55m, and avoided tunnel sinking," the Royal Army said.
According to the construction party, the Central Railway Tunnel Bureau, the tunnel construction, adopted the combination of the tunnel opening and closing, through the construction of horizontal tunnel opening, slurry closing, strengthening the tunnel structure support and construction of sewage treatment station, not only ensured the orderly advancement of the project, but also avoided the construction drainage to the water body of the Small Three Gorges scenic area, while successfully overcoming the bad geology such as the long 7 km of soft rock large deformation, the multi-tipped mud flooding with the maximum daily flow of 15.7 million cubic meters.
After the completion of the Zheng Wan high-speed railway, it will become a new convenient and fast passenger main corridor connecting the southwest of China to the Central Plains, northern China and northeastern China.It is of great significance to improve the capacity and quality of the northeastern and southwest railway corridors, improve the layout of the regional road network, accelerate the development of tourism resources and urbanization along the line, promote regional coordination and development, and promote the implementation of the strategy of large-scale development of the western region.
Experts say the collection of immigration data through the U.S. Census for the distribution of seats in the House is unconstitutional
Some civil rights groups and several US cities and counties have filed lawsuits against the federal government, claiming that the Trump administration's attempts to exclude undocumented immigrants from the US census were both unconstitutional and ineffective.
The United States Census will determine the distribution of seats in the United States House of Representatives.
"It's not going to work," Sarah Brannon, executive attorney for the Civil Rights Freedoms Association of America, told VOA.
She went on to say that Trump's demands for a census to determine the citizenship of those who are being surveyed are difficult to achieve and "not very reliable."
Another civil-rights group, the Common cause, filed a lawsuit Thursday challenging Trump’s executive order.
Several cities in New Jersey and Georgia joined the suit.
Arlington County, Virginia, joined the suit Friday.
"The U.S. Constitution requires us to accurately count our population every 10 years. We must accurately count everyone who lives in Arlington County," said Gary Garvey, chairman of Arlington County's board of directors. "This illegal attempt to scare away and reduce the number of our immigrant communities cannot succeed.
Other organizations and individuals have praised President Trump’s executive orders.
Alabama Attorney General Marshall called the executive order a "victory" for the state.
"The allocation of seats in the House of Representatives and the Electoral College in each state must be based on the number of residents who live in the states and the number of residents who are legal residents," he said.
The US Supreme Court last year prevented the Trump administration from including citizenship in the 2020 census.
President Donald Trump signed an executive order earlier this week directing US Census Bureau Trade Secretary Robert Ross to submit census-collected data on undocumented populations to the administration to exclude them from state census figures, thereby determining whether each state will increase or decrease its seats in the House of Representatives.
The United States redistributes its seats every 10 years to reflect demographic changes.

Pressure and Action to Promote Industrial Project Construction-Viewing-Hunan Daily News-China Voices Online
The hot summer in Hunan, the waves are blowing.
The province's industrial project construction promotes the enthusiasm of the on-site sightseeing, over three-hundred-days of heat, "Industry-versus-strength, project-theory hero" of the sharp direction of the three shores and four waters.
Hunan's development must always rely on construction projects and fostering industries.
Faced with the unusual first half, under the strong leadership of the Central Committee, with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, the province and above persisted in playing a game of chess, devoting all their efforts to fighting two hard battles: the quake and flood prevention, and using industrial projects as the “first moves” in implementing the “six-steady” and “six-safe” policies.
From a 1.9% year-on-year decline in GDP in the first quarter to a 1.3% year-on-year increase in the first half, the difficulty and effort of the period are obvious.
In this precious record sheet, industrial project construction is the key support for Hunan to accelerate economic recovery and develop stability.
The situation is smooth and irreversible.
The construction of industrial projects should be placed in the big picture, and be good at accumulating, accumulating, and seeking potential, and at understanding, seeking, and responding to change.
In the current complex and severe international situation, besides the painstaking efforts of attracting investment, we need to study the new features of the current situation, grasp the rules more carefully, be more scientifically accurate, and better integrate into the new development pattern that is promoted by the domestic and international cycles.
More emphasis on upgrading the industrial base capacity.
In the first half of this year, our province has not only launched a large number of heavy-weight investment projects in emerging industries, but also has sown hopes. Moreover, traditionally advantageous industrial enterprises are accelerating the industrial transformation of digitization, intelligence and greening.
The new factory area of the Changde Cigarette Factory in Hunan Province is dedicated to the process of intelligent transformation and construction of modern factories, and is also a vivid picture of the "old tree sprouting new shoots"Around the country's major strategy and the "two new ones", we will work hard to consolidate the promotion of superior industries, actively cultivate and develop new industries, and increase the overall strength of technological innovation and domestic substitution, so as to consolidate the basic conditions and accumulate the dynamic energy of transformation.
We should pay more attention to cultivating new economy and new business modes.
The sudden outbreak of the new crowning disease has brought the "cloud economy" to the forefront, stimulated the potential of the digital economy and provided a new opportunity for industrial change: in the first half of the year, the computer and office equipment manufacturing industry, electronic and communication equipment manufacturing industry in our province grew 12.6%, the online retailing of wholesale retailers above the limit increased 32.2% year on year, and the online meal fee revenue of catering enterprises increased 35.6% year on year.
It is the tendency to nurture new opportunities in the crisis and open new ones in the changing situation, actively promote digital industrialization and industrial digitization, and guide the integration of the digital economy and the real economy.
More attention is paid to optimizing and stabilizing the chain supply chain.
Engineering machinery is the main force of Hunan industry, but two-thirds of the enterprises that support it are outside the province, and there is still room and potential in the support chain.
To strengthen the thinking and grasping projects of the industrial chain, we need not only the continuous accumulation of the leading enterprises, but also the technological breakthroughs in key links of the industrial chain; we also need to cultivate the latent hearts of all regions, stimulate the "chain" lock reaction by strong chains to complement chains and extend chains, promote the coordinated layout of related supporting industries, and accelerate the construction of independently controllable and safe and reliable industrial chain supply chains.
Hunan is still a hot and pleasant place for business, with a good business environment and a lot of market opportunities.

Employment and Prices Show the Economy Has Temperature - China Economic and Social News
Wang Sishou Editor-in-Chief Wang Sishou
Employment and Prices Show the Economy Has a "Temperature"
China Daily News, China Economic Network.
In the first half of this year, faced with the impact of the new crown pneumonia epidemic, China has been coordinating efforts to promote epidemic prevention and control and economic and social development.The situation of epidemic prevention and control has been steadily improving, the steady recovery of the economy is evident, employment and prices, which are closely related to people's livelihoods, have generally been stable, and the Chinese economy has submitted a warm economic performance report.
In the first two months of this year, the survey unemployment rate rose.
In February, in particular, many enterprises' production and operations were essentially in a state of shutdown, demand for workers decreased, recruitment was delayed or cancelled, and the urban unemployment rate rose.
With the gradual improvement of the situation of epidemic prevention and control, the order of production and life of the whole society is being restored.
The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China has insisted on a stable overall baseline for its work, further strengthened macroeconomic policy countermeasures, strengthened employment priority policies in a comprehensive manner, and actively promoted the work of supporting enterprises to secure and expand employment.
China has increased its policy to hedge against job insecurity, and has launched a policy package of "deductions and exemptions and re-supplying the job", phased out the payment of three social insurance units, allowed the delay in paying social insurance contributions, expanded the return of unemployment insurance to small and medium-sized enterprises, and provided benefits from the worker-on-the-job training policy, subsidized enterprises to absorb key groups of employment, and subsidized apprenticeships, etc.
With the implementation of various employment-secure policies, demand for workers in enterprises steadily rose, the employment situation gradually improved, and the urban unemployment rate declined gradually.
Zhang Yi, director of the Population and Employment Statistics Division of the National Bureau of Statistics, said that employment policies continued to be effective in the second quarter.Labor workers who had left the country due to the epidemic in the previous quarter were gradually returning, and the urban labor participation rate rose by about 10 percentage points in June compared with February, close to the level of the same period last year.
The figures show that the total number of jobs in urban areas rose more than 19% in June compared to February, most industries reached the pre-epidemic level, and the average weekly working hours of enterprise employees reached 46.8 hours, up 6.6 hours from February and slightly higher by 0.1 hours from January.
Prices also affect thousands of households.
In January, the CPI rose 5.4% year-on-year, a record high for many years.
In February, year-on-year CPI growth, though slightly lower, remained in the “Five-Way Zone.”
The year-on-year increase in CPI was high, driven by both the consumption demand before the Spring Festival and the low base figures and the wrong month of the Spring Festival.
However, the effect of the new crown pneumonia epidemic on prices is particularly obvious.
In January and February, the epidemic was affected by logistics delays, inadequate supply of materials, and rising transport costs.In addition, some residents hoarded and looted, and some essentials prices rose significantly.
In order to cope with the disturbance caused by the epidemic prevention and control to the price situation, the relevant departments have included important living materials in the scope of emergency transportation protection to ensure the smooth transportation of materials.
Under the influence of a series of policy measures, the supply of vegetables and fruits in the market is strongly guaranteed.
In response to the rapid rise in pigmeat prices at the beginning of this year, the Central Government has issued a policy of price stability for the supply and demand of pigmeat, and implemented it promptly in all regions and departments.
Since March, pig prices have been falling steadily, leading to a year-on-year increase in food prices of 10.6% in May.In June, pig prices rose slightly in the round-robin, due to slower piglets, reduced imports and a rise in demand for group consumption.
The seasonal variation in the price of fresh vegetables was evident, rising by an average of 3.4 per cent in the first half.
The average annual price of fresh fruit fell 13.3% in the first half of the year, due to the higher base figure compared to the same period last year.
The basic life of the masses is effectively guaranteed and the economic and social situation remains stable and orderly.
With the gradual resumption of transport logistics, the strength of supply and demand insurance has been increased in various places, and the market supply and demand situation has improved.
The CPI fell for four consecutive months in March, and year-on-year growth fell from 4.3 per cent in March to 2.5 per cent in June, as prices generally recovered.
In the second half of the year, prices will remain moderate and overall inflationary pressure will be moderate, but we must continue to restore order in production and life on the premise that epidemic prevention and control are normalized.
We will effectively respond to natural disasters such as flooding and drought in the main producing areas of agricultural products such as grains, fruits and vegetables, strengthen market supervision and resolutely combat acts such as hoarding and speculation, and inflating prices that disturb market order.

"The golden flowers and bees flying in the summertime along the shore of Qinghai Lake are abundant. The high altitude, the great difference in day and night temperature, the low air pollution, and the strong light have nurtured the most tenacious and generous bee colonies, which have made Qinghai Bee King Ju high in activity, high in protein, rich in nutritional value, low in sugar and low in fat.
On 26th, Zhang Jianxun, deputy director of the Industry and Information Administration of the Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture of Hainan, Qinghai Province, said.
On the same day, the "Peaceful Spring Pulp for Farmers" bee products live delivery event was held on the shore of Qinghai Lake.The Chinese Bee Products Association and representatives of entrepreneurs, bee farmers and other various parties gathered together to promote the specialty bee products of Qinghai.
The picture shows the bee products at the bee farmer's site.
The live delivery campaign, which is being conducted through the Beijing-based beekeeping chain chain network, China's leading bee retailers such as Quick Hand and Taobao, as well as live and electronic platforms, has facilitated exchanges and cooperation between "enterprises + bee farmers + growers," and has continued to issue "Qinghai Highland Spring Pulp Consumer Coupons" to consumers through online and offline channels, with the company expected to make a total of nearly $52.8 million in profits throughout the year.
Wu Na, president of Beijing Houde Li Bee Industry Co., Ltd., said the move is "worthwhile": "It will help increase the visibility of Qinghai bee products, attract more consumers to understand and enjoy pure natural bee products without additives, and boost bee farmers' yields."
At present, the company has signed a production cooperation strategy agreement with Qinghai Cloud Bee Industry Co. Ltd. and Qinghai Hua Bao Bee Industry Co. Ltd., hoping to promote the long-term development of the local beekeeping industry in Qinghai.
The picture shows the oilseeds and flowers of the sea by Qinghai Lake.
This spring, roadblocks were put in place to prevent and control the epidemic, and beekeepers were prevented from "catching flowers and honey" on their way.Many bees died from missing the flowering season and lack of food, and beekeepers' incomes were severely affected.
"At the beginning of the year, beekeepers traveled along the long routes of flowering, moving north from Yunnan and Sichuan to the northwest, and they worked very hard to eat and sleep and live in a deserted place.
As a company, we have a responsibility to help them.
"Wanna Says".
"The bees are environmental scouts, and they cannot survive in areas with serious pollution," said Zhao Xiaochuan, vice president of the China Bee Products Association.Pollination is an important link in the ecosystem chain and has an irreplaceable role in protecting plant diversity and improving the environment.
At the same time, bee pollination can increase the productivity and improve the quality of crops, especially in areas where widespread cultivation and poor management conditions, pollination is more important.
Research shows that pollination can increase the yield of rapeseed by about 15% to 30%.
The picture shows Zhao Xiaochuan (right), vice president of the China Bee Products Association, promoting Qinghai bee products.
"The economic, ecological and social benefits of bee pollination far outweigh the value of bee products themselves. The potential of the bee industry for human health, crop production, vegetation reproduction and ecological protection is enormous, and little is known about it.
"Zhao Xiaochuan".
Nowadays, the number of beekeepers is decreasing, and besides beekeepers who are always on the move, there are many poor people who have difficulty in moving and choose to join cooperatives in beehives.
"The state has financial support, we contact technical personnel to help guide, beekeepers lack understanding and judgment about the market environment, and to open markets also need the help and coordination of government, enterprises and industry associations.
said Zhao Xiaochuan.
"We hope that in the future, we will pay more attention to helping bee-keeping groups," Wu said. "Our bee products are also strictly screened and controlled according to national standards to ensure quality and protect consumers' rights while helping bee farmers.

US White House adviser "anti-biting" states too early to resume work-CNN
US White House advisers "anti-biting" states to resume work too early
On July 23, the number of confirmed cases of new coronary pneumonia in the United States surpassed four million, accounting for 30% of the global caseload.
For months, US President Donald Trump repeatedly urged states to restart their workforces, until recently he changed his mind and took the initiative to wear masks in public, and his advisers “anti-bitterly” said that some state governments were too early to restart.
On the 22nd, White House adviser Carrie Conway told a news conference that some state governments had failed to meet the reopening standards and had reopened bars and other venues too early.
Conway also noted that earlier claims that the president had "absolute power" to decide state reconstruction were misleading.
"The president is a federalist, and he believes that states have autonomy.
She defended Trump.
However, the “rumour” that Conway was talking about was what Trump said at the April 13 White House outbreak briefing.
Their actions were criticized by the Internet community as "rewriting history".
Carrie Conway wants to rewrite history. She's a liar.
Trump has called Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmore a dictator because she followed medical guidelines and insisted on a shutdown.
Trump wants to push for reconstruction so that he can hold a rally.
This is not the first time that carrie conway has caused controversy.
On April 15, Conway told Fox News, "This is COVID-19, not COVID-1, folks!"
She seems to understand the 19 as a version number, and is being teased by netizens: If you don't know how to read newspapers!

The playground was smashed and the children went to the school after they got their money back
<unk>?Chief Correspondent, Zhao Yifan
Xiao Wen, 3, was playing in a college playground when he was hit in the head by a baseball player from the Yankees.
After the court ordered the school to pay the damages, the school's attorney, Mr. Wen, sued the school for damages and paid $20,000 in medical expenses and psychological damages.
Recently, the Haidian District People's Court of Beijing has dismissed the plaintiff's claim after considering that the school had set up a safety net on the playground at the time of the incident and had fulfilled its duty to provide adequate safety protection, and that Chen had made compensation.
Mr. Wen alleged that during the summer vacation of 2019, he and Mr. Wen were playing on the school playground while the baseball team was training on the playground.
To avoid the risks, Mr. and Mrs. Wen and many other children and parents are allowed to play in the safe areas designated by the baseball team.
However, the player who was on the base, Chen Sung, took off his hand while throwing, causing the baseball to fly over the net into the above-mentioned safety zone and hit Xiao Wen's backside.
Mr. Wen immediately took Xiao Wen to the hospital for treatment, was diagnosed with a head injury.
Mr Wen said the facilities of the school grounds did not meet the relevant safety regulations and did not manage the teams and related facilities effectively.
The school's negligence caused the above-mentioned incidents, which caused the minor to suffer great pain both physically and mentally, and also brought great pain to his family, and the school should bear legal responsibility for this.
The school argues that the school has set up a safety net at the playground and posted management regulations and training notices, telling children to stay away from the playground and reminding them to be safe, and the plaintiff cannot prove that the school "does not meet its obligations to ensure safety" and therefore does not agree to compensation.
The court held that the school's management of the playground was subject to the security obligation, but that the school's security obligation could only be met by the general duty of care.
The school had set up a safety net on the playground at the time of the incident, and had done its best to ensure proper safety, and Chen Shang also made a compensation agreement with Xiao Wen for medical expenses, transportation costs and other losses of more than 2,000 yuan, the two parties agreed to settle the dispute once.
The school's decision was rejected by the court, which ruled that the plaintiff had not been able to pay the full amount of the damages.
No appeal was filed against the decision, and the case is now pending.
According to Article 37 of the Law on tort liability, schools, as the managers of public places, have the obligation to ensure safety.In the event that the acts of a third party cause damage to others, the third party shall bear the tort liability, and the managers of public places who fail to meet their safety obligations shall bear the corresponding supplementary liability.
The judge said that since as the manager of a public place, it is most likely to know the actual situation of the whole place, foresee the risks and damages that may occur, and thus most likely to take necessary measures to prevent the occurrence of losses or mitigate the extent of damages, and the cost of avoiding and mitigating damages is the lowest, the law stipulates that it must undertake corresponding guarantee obligations in carrying out social activities.
In the present case, the obligation of security for the school should be adapted to the social activities it engages in, especially the basic security measures and the obligation to inform about the hidden dangers, for the non-specific access of the school to the public free of charge.
In judicial practice, it is also not appropriate to impose excessive safety guarantee obligations on public place managers.
If the school has already adopted the establishment of the protection network and has done its duty to inform, it can be determined that the school has no fault and should not bear legal responsibility.
In addition, even if the manager of a public place such as a school fails to meet his obligation to ensure safety, his liability for third party infringement is also a supplementary compensation for damages.
Therefore, in such accidents, the victim should not extend the scope of claims after having received compensation from the directly infringing party.
People's enthusiasm for sports and fitness is on the rise under normalization of epidemic prevention and control.
With the gradual opening of the cross-provincial tourism business, the tourism market is also about to come to a recovery.
Fujian Province resumed cross-provincial tourism operations on July 21, and Xiamen, a popular tourist destination, experienced a peak in tourist flows in the first weekend after opening.
As a popular tourist destination city, Xiamen is visited by many tourists on weekends.
The airport is expected to handle 3.7 million passengers per year, with passenger traffic mainly from the airport to students, tourists and family members.
The tourism market has gradually warmed, with Xiamen Airport operating 440 flights a day in July, and domestic flights have recovered to 80% of their pre-epidemic levels.
The airline encrypted the airline's express routes from Xiamen to Shanghai, Beijing, Kunming, Xi'an and other major cities, taking over the revived tourism market.
At present, Xiamen several travel agencies have launched a series of domestic cross-provincial tour products in the summer, the team trip mainly outdoor attractions.
In response to the peak passenger traffic in the summer season at railway stations and airports, relevant units dispatched additional personnel to evacuate people in areas where people were easily assembled such as check-in counters and security passages.Fujiang also optimized and upgraded the "Eight Minnan Health Code", and achieved health data sharing and mutual recognition with 31 provinces, promoting an orderly recovery of the tourism market.

Israel Strengthens Repeated Prevention and Control of Epidemic - China New Media
Wang Sishou Editor-in-Chief Wang Sishou
Israel Strengthens Repeated Prevention and Control of Epidemics
In the early stages of the outbreak of the new crown pneumonia, Israel's preventive and control measures were effective.
However, with the gradual lifting of the ban, the number of new cases of CJD diagnosed in Israel has increased significantly in recent years and the Israeli Government has taken emergency measures to strengthen the prevention and control of the epidemic on several occasions.
On 28 February, the first case of new coronary pneumonia was diagnosed in Israel, prompting the closure of all ports of entry and exit, suspension of unnecessary industries, the switch to online teaching in schools, restrictions on public transport and unnecessary social activities, the blockade of cities in serious epidemic condition, joint military-police efforts to maintain control and prevention.
The series of measures quickly proved to be successful, and by mid-May, Israel had once again reduced the number of new cases of new coronary pneumonia diagnosed to one per day.
As the epidemic was brought under control, Israeli measures to prevent and control it were lifted, and since June the number of new cases of pneumonia had gradually rebounded.
Especially after July, the spread of the epidemic has been accelerating.
The number of new cases in Israel has been increasing by more than 1,500 every day for eight days. As of the date of the July 25 release, the number of new cases on that day was 916.
As of 25 July, there were 5,9745 confirmed cases in Israel, with 448 deaths.
Faced with the rapid rebound of the epidemic, the Israeli government has taken emergency measures to strengthen the epidemic prevention and control.
On July 6, after the number of confirmed cases exceeded 30,000, the Israeli government closed gyms, swimming pools, bars, nightclubs, and other public entertainment facilities, and introduced a restrictive public transport policy, requiring no more than 20 passengers per bus.
On 17 May, the government announced a series of new restrictions, including the introduction of a "season" on weekends, which would apply from 17:00 on Fridays to 5:00 on Sundays.
During this period, people will be able to go out, but shops, shopping centers, barbershops, beauty salons, libraries, zoos, museums, exhibition centers, swimming pools and tourist attractions will be closed, while basic services such as supermarkets and pharmacies will remain open.
At the same time, meetings of more than 10 people are prohibited on all dates and times, gyms, studios, etc. will be closed, restaurants and cafes are prohibited from eating together, and only out-of-the-box services are allowed.
At the same time, the Israeli people have not paid sufficient attention to the seriousness of the epidemic and have failed to join forces with the government in fighting the epidemic.
After repeated outbreaks of the disease in Israel, many people took to the streets to protest the government's control measures affecting their own economic interests.
On 11 July, tens of thousands of people demonstrated in Tel Aviv, claiming that the anti-epidemic policy was affecting the economy.
On the evening of 21 July, thousands of protesters gathered in front of Netanyahu's residence in Jerusalem, protesting against the measures, including a ban on restaurants and cafeterias, and the failure to compensate.
In addition, many people do not wear masks and keep two meters of safety distance from social gatherings while outdoors, and to avoid being fined by police for not wearing a mask, many people wear masks only on their chins or hanging on their wrists.
The school is a severely affected area for the spread of the new crown virus during the repeated outbreaks. According to a recent visit to the kindergarten, teachers and students in the kindergarten did not wear masks as required by the government, nor did they maintain a two-meter safe social distance between each other, so as to hide the danger of a large number of teachers and students infected with the virus.
Professor Eli Waxman, a member of the Advisory Group of Experts on the Israeli National Security Council's response to the epidemic, said that Israel was moving towards a "dangerous situation" and that the current epidemic prevention and control measures taken by Israel were not sufficient.
Mr. Waxman said Israel lacks a comprehensive plan to combat the disease, and that parliament and government departments should quickly abandon their interests and reach agreement on the issue of combating the disease, including clear steps to restrict the various sectors.

On stage, the singer at a glance, the player in tune, though amateur, but enthusiasm is not diminished.
Just like the rustic style of the farmhouse, outside the Qin dialect, the "grassroots" art and non-heritage culture of the Liangyun Cultural Hall come together.
The museum also houses over 300 artifacts, including farm implements from different ages, traditional and handmade tiles, paper clippings, embroidery, and leather shades.
Liang Yun led the reporter into the exhibition hall in the courtyard, where he displayed his collection of old objects, old wine kettle, triangle, spinning wheel, etc.
Why did an ordinary peasant build a cultural college?
"The filmmaking is my family's handicraft, and I have been learning it since I was 15.
The first National Museum of Natural History was established in 2012 and is the first national museum in the country to be dedicated to the preservation of the intangible cultural heritage of the countryside.
In addition to the Liangyun Cultural Institute, the Yueyuan City's Yueyuan District has more than 120 cultural institutes, 79 folk performing groups, among which there are more than 50 cultural institutes of a certain size, such as Shenjiahe Cultural Institute, Wang Yonghong Cultural Institute, Yang Lang Cultural Institute, etc., covering the townships and streets of the Yueyuan District, and attended by more than 5,000 people.
These grassroots artists are active in the countryside, enriching the cultural life of the masses and satisfying their spiritual needs.
"As life gets better and better, traditional culture cannot be dropped like that.

The 40th Spy Wars Grand Opera, "Winning Calculation," will be released on July 16 on Beijing Weixiang.
The book is based on the Soviet military archives, which were first published in the Dustbin years.
The actor Liu Yunlong, who is known to the audience as "Spy Wars", broke through the image in the play, challenging a rather cheerful "mouth-eating agent".
In recent years, the popularity of the plays such as The Undercover, Mask, and Kite, all prove that the spy warfare type plays have a vigorous vitality.
Unlike previous spy films, The Victory Calculator opens the world to the world, and extends the story to the Far Eastern battlefield of the Soviet Union.
It follows the story of the secret intelligence worker Tang Fei (柳云龙), who, under the leadership of the secretary of the Linhe Party's Communist Party of China and the Soviet Director of Far Eastern Intelligence, is executing the Soviet Far Eastern Intelligence Bureau's "Mudanura" plot.
In many spy warfare, the main character as a senior spy, the appearance is handsome, high-intelligence, mature perfect image.
But Liu Yunlong said that such a person is not suitable for spying. "A spy should be the kind of person who can not find in the pile of people, if the appearance is that very handsome image, I wish everyone would pay attention to you, can you still hide?
So in "Winning Calculation", Liu Yunlong did not spare a heart to design his protagonist Tang Fei as a "mouth-eating agent" with a sense of joy.
The other side of the battle in the game is supported by Fukuhara, played by Liang Guanhua, and Sebao Fang, the police chief of the hall, played by Li Li Guang.
The two powers of the north and south, the drama adds a lot of expert oversight to the whole play.
"They are really sophisticated, they have a very strong sense of empathy, and that kind of empathy is very powerful for me. A lot of times, they are 'hanging', like we just wrote half a page long, and I don't call out when we shoot, and they can go on and on.
The director does not interfere with the actors, and when the actors are in the role and guarantee their character status, not only can the character from the perspective of the character, but also bring more viewing possibilities, Yin Fei said such a play is good enough.
The game also features a number of familiar faces from the "Liu's Spy Wars", including the famous "F4" from "Kitchen" and the "F4" from "The Mountain City", which also featured three of the characters in "Winning Calculation".
He played the roles of Song Xiaoan and Zhao Jinzhi, Hou Yu and Liu Nayang, and this time again played the left arm of Tang Fei.
"They have no inferiority," said director Yin Fei. "They just drifted away in that time and environment.
Liu Yunlong also suggested, "We need to have a sense of compassion. This sense of compassion means that there must be good people around me, bad people are enemies, but we must also develop them and our troops must be strengthened.
The ending of the play is also carefully designed by Liu Yunlong, who believes that he will give the audience a satisfactory answer.

"4 students drowned in Arong flag incident in Inner Mongolia" - China News Agency
On the evening of July 25, a reporter from the government of Aryong Banner in the city of Hulunber, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, reported that four students had drowned.
At 15:50 on 24 July, 110 officers of the Aryongqi Public Security Bureau were told by the police that six junior high school students had drowned.
The police arrived at the scene and immediately rescued two students, and the local emergency department, water conservancy bureau and other units were on the scene, participating in the rescue.
The rescue team was composed of more than 80 people from the police, fire department, fire department, medical department, and other departments, and sent three rubber boats to the area to search for the missing persons.
The reporters learned that local rescuers found the first victim at 06:40 on July 25, the second victim at 11:30 on July 25, the third victim at 12:40 on July 25, and the last victim at 13:34 on July 25.
The officials said the drowning alarmed the entire community.
At present, the local government is organizing some knowledge of drowning prevention, hoping that the tragedy will not happen again.
Hong Kong's financial market remains active and orderly, said Xu Zhengyu, the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, Xinhua news agency reported on July 25.
He expressed optimism about financial stability and the economy in Hong Kong.
Hong Kong is experiencing difficulties due to the "recurrent outbreak" and the new crown pneumonia outbreak, Mr Hui said at an online seminar organised by the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in Toronto and the Hong Kong-Canadian Chamber of Commerce (Canadian Association) on 24 October (Toronto time).
Hong Kong dollar exchange rate is stable and favours the exchange rate guarantee level of stronger party.
The banking system has no obvious cash outflows, but has seen more than $11 billion inflows since June.
Bank deposits have also continued to rise in the past few months, and stock markets have seen a series of public offerings and rising market volumes.
Mr Hui said the new pneumonia outbreak was putting pressure on the global economy and financial markets, but Hong Kong's fundamental advantages remained unchanged.
Hong Kong's advantages, including geography, the rule of law, high-speed communications, free flow of information and capital, and a simple, low-tax system, have made it a leading international financial centre.
Mr Hui said the HK$6 billion reserve in the "Epidemic Prevention and Control Fund" would create about 30,000 temporary jobs in the public and private sectors over the next two years, covering people with different skills and qualifications.
To support the development of financial technology, the HKSAR Government has also launched the Thousand People Scheme to support local financial technology companies, start-ups and other enterprises with financial technology-related businesses. The scheme will create 1,000 new jobs, employ local talent and enrich Hong Kong's financial technology talent pool.
Looking ahead, Mr Hui expressed optimism about Hong Kong's financial stability and economy.
He encouraged Canadian companies to take advantage of Hong Kong's position as an international financial centre, an international asset and wealth management centre and a global offshore renminbi business hub to develop and invest in the Guangdong-Macau-Hong Kong-Dawan area and the surrounding areas.
Chinese Communist Party's "Liu Yedao" Publication Praises China's Anti-Epidemic Efforts Encourages Countries to Learn Experiences-Chinanews.net
China, a country of 1.4 billion people and similar in size to Europe or the United States, has effectively controlled the new crown disease at this stage, without any large-scale spread, and has largely contained the epidemic at home, according to a 25 day issue of the journal Liu Yedao.
China has invested heavily in research and public health over the past decade, making it much better prepared for new crowns than it was for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), the article said.
The authors say China was initially underprepared for the 2002 SARS outbreak, especially because the pathogen was uncertain.
When the new crown virus was discovered in December 2019, Chinese scientists were able to quickly identify the virus's species and shared genome sequencing data with the international community on January 11, 2020.
By the end of January, doctors from mainland China and Hong Kong had elucidated the virus's clinical features and warned the world of the threat of the new crown virus by publishing a study in the journal Lancet.
China has also been at the forefront of vaccine research, which has been conducted very quickly and rigorously through close cooperation within the country in times of state-declared emergency, and published the results of early trials of a new crown vaccine developed in China in May and July in the journal Liu Yedao.
China's experience shows that it is very important to invest in the national health and research system and effectively improve laboratory capacity.
This is the basis for a rapid and effective national response to health emergencies and global health security.
Other countries, especially low- and middle-income countries, are worth learning from.
Moreover, China’s experience has shown that strong research and decision-making at the top must be based on sound scientific evidence, so that the new crop epidemic can be effectively controlled.
The article emphasizes that governments and their leaders must respect science, understand its value, and act on it in the most beneficial way for society.
In the early days of the outbreak, the National Committee for Defense and Construction of China sent three teams of infectious disease experts to Wuhan to investigate the risks and spread of the new crown virus, and their recommendations provided the basis for the decision to "seize" Wuhan on January 23.
The article concludes by emphasizing that in order to respond to global health emergencies, countries need to strengthen global cooperation and jointly respond.

At around 14:40, a small plane crashed into a multi-storey attic on Hopescamp Street in Wetherland County, killing three people, according to a statement released late that night by the Duisburg prosecutors, Wetherland County Police and Wetherland Fire Department.
The aircraft took off from Mal, Northwestern Virginia, at a stop in Wetherland County, Virginia, and crashed into a residential building.
The victim was either a female resident in the crashed house or two passengers on a small plane.
A two-year-old child was only slightly injured in the room and was rescued safely.
The rest of the housemates were not injured in the accident, but their moods remained unchanged.
The scenes reported by the daily Der Spiegel showed that the houses in the accident were once smoked, and firefighters extinguished the fire, which showed the damage to the houses.
The cause of the aircraft crash is not yet clear.
The Rhine Post quoted police as saying that there were clues that the plane had decayed before it hit a residential building.
Police said several parts of the crashed plane were found in the area.
The German criminal police are investigating the cause of the accident together with the Duisburg prosecutor and the German Federal Aviation Accident Investigation Agency.

The Ministry of Health announced on 26 January that, by 12 noon, 481 new confirmed cases of coronary heart disease had been confirmed in Singapore, with 50,369 confirmed cases and 27 confirmed deaths.
The data show that of the new confirmed cases, 5 were local community cases, 4 were imported cases and the rest were foreign workers living in special dormitories.
The Singapore Ministry of Health says 98 per cent of new confirmed cases are related to known infections.
There are still 173 new coronary patients in hospital, most of whom are stable or improving, and no one is in a critical care ward.
In addition, 4,648 people were isolated from community facilities.
Foreign workers account for the vast majority of the Singaporean population infected with the new crown.
According to statistics, there are 200,000 foreign workers in 43 foreign workers' dormitories in Singapore, and about 100,000 foreign workers in other types of dormitories.
The Singapore government is stepping up testing of the last few foreign workers' dormitories with higher rates of new crown infection, the interdepartmental task force said on Thursday.
After the completion of all the tests for the special dormitories, the vast majority of foreign workers will be able to return to work, but they will still have to undergo regular new examinations.
"The Greatest Hits" won the Golden Globe Award.
On 18 July, the 23rd Shanghai International Film Festival announced the official list of films selected for the Golden Globe Awards.
The first film, "The Good Luck", by Dapeng, was successfully screened at the Shanghai Film Festival and the first poster was released.
Poster, sheet for drawing
The film is the first real-life film directed by Dapeng and is also his second tie to the Golden Globe.
The film tells the story of a comedian who, after a sudden and bizarre dream, returns to his old home in the northeast countryside and hopes to make a film about how his family spent the year.
The family members who had gathered for the filming had finished the final party.
In today’s poster, the family member, Wang Jiaoqiang, sits smoking in the center of the picture, against a silver-clad northeast black landscape, with a red lantern that Chinese must hang at the Chinese New Year.
The red lantern, which symbolizes joy and unity, contrasts greatly with the lonely King's auspicious sign, which also seems to reveal the complexity and conflict in this family relationship.
The film is about the three-uncle Wang Jiaoqiang's daughter played by actor Liu Lu, the rest of the scenes are done by the real director's family, the experimental visual and audio style, breaking the boundaries between drama and reality, and bringing the audience a new immersive viewing experience.
According to director Dapeng, the film’s creation was “a natural event,” with a series of family changes that suddenly changed the original filming schedule, and the filming of life without a script, which released tensions that transcended design.
How does director Dapeng face this " will of heaven ", how should continue to meet the changes brought by this will of heaven?
There is no doubt that the experimental, almost amateur cast and innovative audio-visual style of Good Luck turned life in front of the camera into a movie, and the audience will find themselves and their family's shadow from the family presented in the film, under the wrapping of the real image, and with the end of the family reunion in the film, arouse a series of thoughts.

The guards stationed at the Baguet Cho Kang sentry post, lined with Chang Yuwang and a soldier.
In the midst of a year of average temperatures of less than <unk>?0, a row of simple barracks stands at the mouth of the mountain. Not far from the barracks, a flag flutters in the wind, and soldiers are on duty in the wind every day, while regularly patrolling higher altitudes.
The soldiers climbed the steep hills of the stone heap, using their hands and feet.
In late July, the low-lying areas were full of flowers and plants, while in Batong Zhongkang, only the trenches behind the camp were relatively dense in green.
The soldier, who had been stationed at the post for six years, pointed to the ditch and said, 'This is their back garden. It is only in July and August that we see the slow growth of the grass.
It can take about nine hours to walk around.
In the harsh highlands, the soldiers who live there are often accompanied by snowy mountains and glaciers, and they also regularly patrol higher altitudes.
A patrol of eight soldiers, led by instructor Liang Yi-caun, has once again taken to the patrol road.
Each soldier weighs about 30 kg and heads for the target early in the morning.
A soldier was on the way, and his comrades rushed to the rescue.
In addition to patrolling, the soldiers at the Bagnoot Chokan sentry station are given daily tactical and physical training.
One minute by one second, the altitude rises, the oxygen levels drop, and the strength overexerts, all test the will of the patrol.
They persisted in biting their teeth, and then crossed several collapse points, and several hurricane-prone beaches.
At 4:00 p.m., it was lunchtime for the patrol, who took out their own dry food, sat down at an altitude of over 5,700 meters, and supplemented their strength with food accompanied by snow.
The soldiers at the Bagnoot Chokan sentry station are being trained in tactics and physical fitness.
During the break, they play cards together, and the losers do a dive and push-ups, both for entertainment and physical exercise.
After a brief rest in the cold wind, they climbed to the patrol's target point, took the flag and solemnly swore on the mountain's mouth.
Behind them are snow-capped mountains, and in front of them are hundreds of miles of no man's land. They are the safest guardians of the country's gates.
Beijing Consumer Quarter Reopens - Official website
Beijing will reopen all activities of the Beijing Consumer Season in accordance with the principle of "overall reopening, priority planning, orderly promotion, and strict organization."
On July 26, 1.5 million government and business consumer vouchers were issued, including 1 million underground food and beverage vouchers, 500,000 smart product vouchers, and consumers can obtain them through the jingdian app.
Liu Meiying, deputy director of the Beijing Commerce Bureau, said at a press conference on 25th that the newly-launched consumer season will further reduce the company's capital allocation on the basis of maintaining the existing discounted subsidy for consumer vouchers and packages.
The government and enterprises will start to pay out capital from early August onwards. The current 1:1 ratio will be adjusted to 2:1. For example, consumers will receive a $120 discount when they take a card to a store, with the government subsidizing $60 and enterprises paying $60.
During the consumption season, the three major carriers will subsidize traffic and terminals around 5G consumption, further promoting Beijing's new 5G infrastructure and 5G new consumption.
Hong Kong economy hit by epidemic again, says Chen-Mao-po - China New Media
Hong Kong is facing a new wave of cholera outbreaks, which have hit business and economic activity, said Mr. Chen Mao-bo, finance secretary of the HKSAR government, on Sunday.
The Government has again called on small and medium-sized owners to reduce their rents and to work hard with retailers, restaurants and small and medium-sized enterprises.
Chen Maobo published an article on the day entitled "Rogged Road to Recovery" on the Internet.
He said the recent high number of confirmed cases of new coronary pneumonia in Hong Kong is a serious situation that has affected the livelihoods of the community and the economy.
In the event of repeated outbreaks, the first priority is to prevent import cases, deal with them as quickly as possible and break the transmission chain. Economic activities should be resumed in a timely manner when the outbreaks are under control.
He said that the new wave of epidemic shocks had hit business and economic activity, which had been enjoying a slight recovery.
Social responsibility is equally important to the business community, in addition to the spirit of the contract, especially for groups receiving large government subsidies under the Employment Insurance Scheme.
He said Hong Kong's economy remained very weak in the second quarter of this year, but the contraction seemed to have slowed slightly.
On the export side, he said the situation on Hong Kong's periphery remained grim.
Mr Chan said the development of Hong Kong over the past decades has shown that every crisis hides new opportunities and every difficulty hides the keys to future development.

The next week, it is still not excluded that there will be more than four-magnitude aftershocks.
Marinichev said the change in value was influenced by the depreciation of the ruble and epidemics.
"The cost of services is rising," he said.
People are spending more time on the Internet because of the epidemic.
Marinichev does not rule out a sharp rise in Internet prices this year, arguing that operators can compensate for dissatisfaction with the rise by offering customers higher speeds and more services.

The exhibition area is full of red creative products, the revolutionary old area of exotic products, attracting tourists to buy from all over the place.
"This Red Expo is not only an exhibition of the achievements of the national red cultural industry, but also an important platform for exchanging experiences and exploring the path of development between exhibiting units and enterprises," he said.
The first edition of the Hong Kong Expo, which was held in Xiangtan, was held under the theme of "Promoting Red Culture to Promote the Rise of Literature," and the exhibition area was nearly 3,000 square meters.

"Newly diagnosed cases of coronary artery disease in Japan exceed 30,000 cases".
According to statistics, on 26th, there were 239 new confirmed cases in Tokyo, and more than 200 new cases in a single day for six consecutive days, bringing the total to 11,214 cases.
In addition, 141 new cases of confirmed disease were diagnosed in Osaka Prefecture, 90 new cases in Fukuoka Prefecture, and 80 new cases in Aichi Prefecture.
The number of fraud offenses in telecommunication networks increased by 70% in the first half of the year
According to the Supreme Prosecutor's Office, the country's prosecutors' offices prosecuted 58,101 people for fraud in the first half of this year, up 35% year-on-year.
In particular, fraudulent crimes are more frequent in the crime of preventing and controlling epidemic conditions, and the number of fraudulent crimes prosecuted by procuratorial organs accounts for 43.4% of the total number of crimes of preventing and controlling epidemic conditions.
The Supreme People's Procuratorate has been carrying out specific guidance, and nine of the ten cases of fraud involving epidemic prevention and control have been published so far.
From the first half of the year, the number of cases handled by procuratorial organs involving fraud offenses ranged from the macro-policy of the state to the daily life of ordinary people, including fraud involving epidemics, fraud involving "medical care", fraud involving "health care products", fraud involving "admission intermediaries", fraud involving "schedule loans", fraud involving fraud involving the defrauding of state subsidies, fraud involving the freezing of national assets, etc., and the scope of the cases covered various areas, including education, medical care, employment, pensions, social security, land requisition and demolition, precise poverty alleviation, financial credit, etc., not only caused economic losses to the victims, but also seriously affected economic and social development.
In particular, some telecommunications network frauds break through the borders, geographical areas and personnel restrictions, have the characteristics of involvement of the public, cross-border, remote, electronic payment, etc., and many victim groups are not specific, and the harm is great.
For example, some companies have set up specialized companies, rented high-end offices, set up multiple departments or posts, advertised and recruited using legal online platforms, trained and evaluated recruiters, and managed their business models in a "legal" way, which is more confusing.
It is the duty of procuratorial organs to punish and prevent crime according to law and to issue early warning to the public and relevant departments in a timely manner.
In the administration of justice, the procuratorial organs carry out their duties seriously, not only insisting on maintaining a high pressure on fraudulent crimes, but also targetedly fine-tuning various enforcement measures, and promoting social governance by issuing recommendations to prosecutors.
The procuratorial organs shall strictly examine the facts, evidence, procedures and application of law in cases of arrest and prosecution of fraud, and shall base them on facts and apply the law as the yardstick, so as to do so without injustice or deceit.
Especially, in the case of telecommunication network fraud, we pay attention to the core role of electronic data in fact identification, and try to build the chain of evidence between electronic data, verbal evidence and written evidence.
If the case of fraud involving an epidemic is handled by the Yinzhou District Procuratorate of Ningbo City, Zhejiang Province, the procuratorial organs intervene early in the first place, from the case to the conclusion, only takes five days, reflecting the attitude and determination to handle the case strictly and safeguard the stability of the social situation.
In the section of examination of arrest and examination of prosecution, attention was paid to the case of the missing criminal prosecution, correction of the public security organs for the missing arrest of 733 people, correction of the public security organs for the missing examination and prosecution of 1,113 people of the same criminals.
In the first half of the year, the national procuratorial organs issued 298 recommendations on fraudulent crimes, promoting joint efforts to prevent fraudulent crimes and promote deep-level governance.
For example, in response to the loopholes in the regulation of telecommunications networks found in the cases of telecommunications enterprises, banks and intermediary organizations, the Guangzhou Procuratorate of Guangdong Province and Dongguan City Procuratorate of Dongguan City promptly make recommendations for inspection, urging the relevant units to strengthen the supervision and improve the mechanisms to help promote the construction of effective systems.
Fourth, do your best to track down and destroy the stolen goods.
The procuratorial organs of all places shall seize the important links of intervening in the investigation, guiding the taking of evidence, examining and prosecuting, and urge the investigating organs to actively recover the stolen money, cooperate with the relevant departments in the work of recovering and damaging the stolen money, and endeavour to minimize the economic losses caused by fraudulent crimes to the people.
In the case of the Lin Road Loan case handled by the Beijing Procuratorate, which involved 22 sets of properties waiting to be sealed off, the first to issue a "Long-Term Enforcement Letter" in case the property may be dealt with beforehand in other cases, and to send it to the relevant courts in time, suggesting that the courts that previously sealed off the property concerned be delayed in the enforcement of the property concerned, and that the crime be handled uniformly after the facts of the crime are clarified, in order to make the greatest efforts to recover the property concerned and to recover the victims' losses.
The prosecutor reminded people to be very vigilant against fraudulent crimes, not to expect "the pie will fall on the sky", and not to believe in cheapness, and to keep their "money bag".
Zhongnan Town in Wenning County, Guizhou Province: Shortened Apple Tree, Broadened the Road to Combat Poverty-CNN
China Economic Network (China Economic News) Responsible Editor: Zhu Yanjing
The reporter of China Economic Daily - China Economic Network walked into the village of Zhonghai in the town of Yanna in Wenning County, Guizhou Province.
In the hot sun, the villager Li Yuanzhong hoes grass in the base, although his face is sunburnt red, but he hums a few little songs from time to time.
The town of Wingning, which is located in the Yunnan Province, has a high latitude, high altitude, abundant sunlight, large difference in temperature between day and night, and the apples produced contain high sugar content and good taste, and have a certain reputation in the surrounding area, but because of the small head and many spots, it has not been able to sell a good price, and has not been able to form an industry.
The town was once a poor village of "Baotani Yang Imado De Chunqiu", and 10 years ago the local poverty rate was as high as 25.8%.
In the critical period of the fight against poverty and the victory in the final battle, it is urgent to change traditional cultivation habits, adjust the industrial structure and increase farmers' income.
After several visits, Zhuanna Party secretary Chen Chao and a group of people in the town believe that the development of industry can not go the old way.
To this end, the town of Yunnan introduced the leading enterprises, and cultivated apples in a modern way.
In 2015, Hou Jianwen, vice-president of Wingning Over Agriculture Co., Ltd., came to Yanna Town from Shaanxi to investigate the local planting conditions at a glance, and began to grow apple trees there in 2016.
At first, the village mobilized Li Yuanzhong to turn the land over to grow apple trees, and the Li Yuanzhong couple began to wonder: "I have grown apples for so many years, and I have not seen anyone in the village grow apples to make money.
"The apples that are grown are all dwarf apples, so they don't grow too tall.
What Li Yuanzhong didn't realize was that this time the apple cultivation adopted a new method, irrigation pipes were laid under each apple tree, water and fertilizer were poured into the roots, and when the autumn harvest, the tractor went directly into the orchard, and could pick the fruit standing.
At present, the apple base has gradually entered a boom period, and the market is also as expected by Hou Jianwen, apples are not trouble selling, and are loved by urban consumers such as Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou.
The growing apple industry has given Li Yuanzhong a new life, and although he is still growing the land, he has a new source of income.
The company has a total of nine employees, and each year, the company pays a fee of $80 per employee, which is the same as the annual salary of the company's employees.
Li Yuanzhong told reporters that last year, the profit distribution received 2,800 yuan, plus the land transfer fee and the husband and wife's worker income, the family income 80,000 yuan, "no worry about food and clothing, the days of prosperity have passed.
"They are already producing fruit, with an annual yield of over 150,000 yuan per acre, about 10 times that of corn," he said.
Chen Chao told reporters that the entire town of Yanna has planted 20,000 acres of apples, and in the village of Zhonghai alone there are 6,000 acres, covering 4,056 farming households and 1,720,000 people, including 656 poor households and 2,952 people who have built a business card, and paid more than 6 million yuan a year.
Li Yuanzhong, whose waistband is growing, is also beginning to realize his "wishes".
"I still have a dozen acres of land at home. When the next step is to expand the Apple base, I'll give them all the money and I'll get more income.

Membrane Separation Technology Helps to Defeat "Greenhouse Effect"
Intended diagram of preparation technology of new hybrid matrix membrane
Tianjin University's Atmospheric Environment and Bioenergy Team has made significant progress in the field of membrane separation for capturing carbon dioxide, and has successfully developed a new mixed-base membrane preparation technology to greatly improve the capturing performance of membrane materials.
The results have been published as cover articles in the international journal Greenhouse Gases: Science and Technology.
The greenhouse effect is a major environmental problem that is troubling human development, and carbon dioxide emissions are the culprits of the greenhouse effect.
How to capture and use CO2 efficiently from human emissions is a focus of attention for scientists.
The membrane separation method is a new carbon dioxide capture technology, which separates carbon dioxide gas with the help of membrane materials, and has the characteristics of high efficiency, energy saving and simple operation.
How to let the membrane material "deep breathe", improve the gas separation efficiency, is the bottleneck of capturing carbon dioxide by membrane separation.
The research team of Tianjin University has developed innovative ideas and explored the influence of different solvents on membrane gas separation properties through repeated experiments.
The results show that the N-methylpyrroleone is a more homogeneous and "air permeable" carbon nanotube in the film material, which effectively improves the gas separation efficiency and rate.
The separation properties of CO2 in mixed matrix membranes prepared with this new technology are close to the theoretical separation limits of such membrane materials.
"The new technology provides a new way of capturing carbon dioxide by membrane separation," he said.
"We hope this technology will provide strong support for the future coal-fired power plants and chemical companies to handle flue gas and play a major role in controlling greenhouse gas emissions," said Li Lun, a member of Tianjin University's Atmospheric Environment and Bioenergy team.
Find out what is the difference between the professional and the general-CNN
Chongqing Morning Post Responsible Editor: Yu Xiao
Before you fill out the form, you should understand what is the difference in professional grade
Each year, students or parents who do not know the terms involved in the application of the volunteers, and thus affect the application of the volunteers.
This year, five universities, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing University of Science and Technology, Beijing Postal and Telecommunication University, Beijing Forestry University and Beijing Chemical University, jointly issued admission policies for 2020, eliminating the difference in professional grades.
What does the difference in professional grade mean and what is the significance of it in the volunteering?
There are three ways to allocate professional resources
Experts reminded that before filling out the volunteer, must read the Admission Regulations of the Hearty School, understand the admission rules of universities, including filing ratio, specialty allocation rules, etc.
The specialty allocation rule refers to the three ways of specialty priority, grade priority and grade difference for specialty admission after the university filing.
The specific method of use of universities will be specified in the Admissions Regulations.
However, there are some universities admission principle is the total priority, there is no grade difference between the majors.
If the student is not in the first grade, the student will be asked to enter the second grade, and the student will be asked to enter the third grade, and the student will be asked to enter the last grade.
The "specialty level difference" is the number of points that the institutions, when arranging the candidates' specialties, publish in the admission regulations to determine the admission of volunteer candidates in different specialties.
The difference between the number of points in the first and non-first majors, the difference between the number of points in the second and third majors, and the number of points in the first and third majors.
For example.
Assuming that Xiao Ming registered for A university, he took 560 points, and his professional volunteers were: computer, international trade, automation, mechanical engineering, electronic commerce, A university's professional admission practices the method of professional grade difference, the grade difference is divided into 2 points, 1 point, 1 point, 0 points.
If the first-year student is not successful in the first year, the student will be awarded a credit of 558 points, and the second-year student will be awarded a credit of 557 points.If the third-year student is not successful in the first year, the student will be awarded a credit of 556 points.If the fourth-year student is not successful in the first year, the student will be awarded a credit of 556 points.
Different University Specialty Levels
The number of students enrolled in the program has increased steadily over the years, and the number of students enrolled in the program has increased steadily over the years, with more than 20 students enrolled in the program this year.
For example, Sichuan Agricultural University, Shandong University of Science and Technology, Heilongjiang University of Chinese Medicine, Jiangsu University of Science and Technology, Jiangxi Normal University, Chengdu Medical College, Northeast Electric Power University, Jimei University, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing Industrial University, Ningxia University, Shandong University of Science and Technology, China Civil Aviation Flight Academy, etc.
In these universities, each university has different degrees.
Some universities have grading differences for each major, such as Ningxia University, where the files are submitted to the candidates, and the candidates are admitted in order of their grades after the order of the volunteers in the major is reduced by one point.
Some universities have different degrees between different majors.
For example, at the University of Missouri, the difference in the grades of the first and second majors is 4 points, while the difference in the grades of the third and fourth majors is 3 points, and the difference in the grades of the fifth and sixth majors is 1 point.
The school has a specialized curriculum for the students, and the students are required to study at the same time as the school. The school has a specialized curriculum for the students, and the students are required to study at the same time as the school.

"A 3-year-old girl dies of a newborn virus".
A three-year-old girl died of a new-crown virus infection, the youngest new-crown death in the country, the Belgian health ministry said on Thursday.
The Belgian health ministry spokesman, Boudewijn Catri, said the girl had other serious illnesses before she contracted the new crown virus; in addition to the girl, an 18-year-old had recently died of the virus.
Last week, 85 per cent of new coronary surgeons in Belgium were under 60, Mr. Cartery said.
He warned healthy, younger people not to lose heart.
“Although young people are rarely killed by new crown virus infections, no one is immune now.”
Last week, Belgium’s new confirmed cases of new coronary heart disease rose 89% from the previous week, with an average of 2.9 deaths per day from the virus, up from 1.7 per day the previous week.
During the peak of the epidemic in Europe, the proportion of people infected with the new crown virus in Belgium was “at the top of the list” in Europe.
Belgium has a population of more than 11 million.
The latest figures show that a total of 64847 people in Belgium have been infected with the new crown virus.
Mr. Carter warned earlier this week that action must be taken before the snowballs roll larger and larger and eventually cause avalanches.
To curb the resurgence, Belgian Prime Minister Sophie Vermes announced on 23 August that the rules on wearing masks in public places would be tightened and that a plan to lift further restrictions in August would be suspended.

All APEC member economies should act in unison to fight the epidemic and promote economic recovery, and should avoid the creation of unnecessary trade barriers in accordance with the rights and obligations set by the World Trade Organization, the Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government, Mr. Qiu Danghua, said on July 25, Xinhua.
Mr. Qiu made the statement at a video conference of trade ministers on the fight against the new crown disease epidemic at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) on 25 April.
At the meeting, the Ministers exchanged views on substantive programmes to be undertaken by APEC to respond to the impact of the new cholera epidemic and to promote economic recovery in the region.
The public health and economic crisis triggered by the outbreak has had unprecedented far-reaching social and economic impact, Mr. Qiu said.
"We are in a double battle, and we must first overcome the epidemic to save the economy.
We need to be clear about our goals, the virus is our common enemy, and cooperation will win, and failure will be the opposite.
Qiu said a series of trade restrictions triggered by the new crown pneumonia outbreak did not help control the outbreak.
Trade is the key to solving the current problems and should not be seen as the problem.
He condemned all policies and measures that were discriminatory and divisive and urged all economies to maintain open borders, maintain smooth supply chains and avoid the creation of trade barriers or irrational trade policies at this critical time.
"Canada's second-season worst case of cholera in U.S. states: 414,000 confirmed cases".
Florida reported more than 414,000 new confirmed cases of coronary heart disease, surpassing New York's 411,000, making it the second-largest "epidemic area" in the United States after California, according to the website of Johns Hopkins University.
Florida reported 124 cases of death on April 24, the Florida Department of Health said.
This is the tenth time since the outbreak that the state has seen more than 100 deaths a day.
The state's worst case of the disease has reached more than 100,000 in Miami-Dade County.
There are currently 8,973 new coronary patients in Florida, 1,874 of whom are in Miami-Dade.
The number of hospitalizations in New Hampshire has increased by 79% since July 4.

Chengdu crowded around the consulate, police prevented people "looking too happy"
China announced Friday that it would close its consulate in Chengdu in response to the US closure of the Chinese consulate in Houston.
On Saturday, the badge of the U.S. consulate was removed, and on Sunday, a dark-glass car drove away from the consulate amid the screams of passersby.
On Sunday, many Chengdu residents piled up in front of the U.S. consulate to take photos, and those who had not come to see the exhibition were driven by curiosity about the current situation.
The station reporter also visited the Chengdu American Consulate, and reported that there were many curious people, many parents with children to walk to the consulate, take photos of the building, or take selfies.
The consulate was surrounded by guards who, from time to time, "corrected" people's behavior and seemed to prevent any outbursts: a woman who had just begun singing the song was stopped and a guard confiscated a banner.
But residents of a nearby residential building managed to raise a giant Chinese flag on their balcony and shouted slogans in support of China.
The U.S. Consulate in Chengdu, opened in 1985, covers all consular-related matters in southwestern China, particularly the Tibet Autonomous Region.
The Chinese government's reaction to the U.S. has been relatively restrained, with many Chinese online demanding that the government close the U.S. consulate in Hong Kong, but officials saying only that "closing the U.S. consulate in Chengdu is a necessary and legitimate response to the U.S.'s unreasonable behavior," AFP's Chengdu station correspondent said.
In addition to the United States, there are also embassies in Shanghai, Shanghai, Shenyang, Wuhan and Hong Kong.

(Newspaper) On July 25, two tents carrying 5G new media mobile cloud broadcasting system were driven out of the scene under the eyes of the guests of the large-scale media-fusion operation "Go Village Live to Watch the Fight Against Poverty" organized by the Financial Program Center of the Central Broadcasting and Television Corporation (CBTV) from Xuzhou, Jiangsu Province.
The President said, "2020 is a milestone year, we will achieve the first century of economic growth and development, achieve the first goal of struggle, and 2020 is also the year of resolute fight to fight poverty and win the war."
The large-scale media-fusion campaign "Live View of the Villages to Fight Poverty" is an important initiative of the Central Broadcasting and Television Corporation's Financial Program Center to coordinate with this major theme and to do a good job of campaigning for and promoting the fight against poverty.
The campaign will go into the villages of more than 20 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities directly under the Central Government to dive into the stories of the living people who have escaped poverty, and directly hit the villages with the transformation of their appearance, showing how villagers have overcome their difficulties in survival and development and made it to the road to wealth.
The operation will last for more than three months.
The reporter started from Xuzhou, and traveled by two routes, one along the Southwest Line, passing through Anhui, Hubei, Jiangxi, Hunan, Guangxi, Guizhou, Sichuan, Chongqing, Yunnan, Tibet, etc., and the other along the Northwest Line, passing through Henan, Shaanxi, Gansu, Qinghai, Xinjiang, Ningxia, Inner Mongolia, Shanxi, Hebei, etc., traveling more than 10,000 kilometers.
In the form of reporting, "go village live to see poverty alleviation" boldly integrated.
The economic development of the villages where the caravans are going will be broadcast through CCTV Financial Channel, China Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission, China Economic Voice, CCTV Financial News Agency.
The programme will be broadcast live on CCTV's China Financial News Channel (first broadcast: Monday to Sunday, 12:00-13:00), and the CCTV's Gold Channel's Economic Information Network (first broadcast: Monday to Sunday, 20:30-21:30).
At the same time, the caravan will carry out a live broadcast of each village in the CCTV financial client for up to one hour, the audience can watch live through the download of CCTV financial APP, participate in the lottery.
In terms of technology applications and broadcast room design, "Go Village Live to Watch the Eradication of Poverty" bravely broke through, creating the "Outdoor New Media Tent Car".
The car is equipped with 5G new media mobile cloud broadcasting system, using 5G+4K/8K+AI technology, realizes the organic combination of online and offline, large screen and small screen, television broadcasting.
The three-way transmission is equipped with a 12-metre long, 2.55-metre wide and 3.98-metre high container, which is hydraulically unfolded and can be turned up to 120 degrees.
The station also has a self-expanding, externally expandable platform, which can accommodate up to 50 square meters, and can accommodate most of the show's scenes.
The Dongchuan district of Kunming City is already hot in summer, and the more hot than the weather is the easy relocation of the poverty-relief workshop next to the resettlement point.
"Now, when you come out of your home, you can go into the factory and make money," says Lu Ling, a staff member at ASF Electronics and Technology in Kunming. "It's thanks to free vocational skills training organized by the union.
A busy scene of a fire-up in the streets of Dongchuan District Copper City electronic components processing poverty alleviation workshop.
A single mother in her 40s, she carries her children alone and takes care of older parents.
In her most difficult time, the Dongchuan District General Union helped her come up with ideas and ideas, and "carried coal in the snow" before running.
As of 2018, the company has been offering loans to students, colleges, and universities for the purpose of providing them with a variety of services, including education, health care, and social security.
This year, her children have graduated and are employed, and she herself has got a job and income after taking part in skill training, and has been out of poverty since the end of April.
It is reported that Dongchuan District General Organization to help combat poverty and strengthen special skills training project, is part of the Yunnan Province General Trade Union skills training.
The district summarized the characteristics of the hard-working workers who could easily help the district to help the poor and moved to the relocation point, conducted in-depth investigations to understand the training needs, determined the types of training, and planned to train 450 people in the near future, including electricians, welders and spotters.
Recently, the Agricultural Bank of Yunnan Menglian County branch staff member Li Yi wrote a letter of sincere thanks to the county union.
In her letter, she sincerely thanked the union for the financial support she received from August 2013 to January 2017 to help her complete her studies.
In 2004, Li Yi's father died in a car accident, and her mother was included in the hardship workers file, and since then, she has enjoyed the care of the building of the parking policy.
With the help of the local union, Li Yi completed her studies successfully.
Since 2016, 3809 households have been relieved of their plight through system guarantees and precise assistance.
The successful emancipation of the Luling family and Li Yi is a miniature of the Yunnan Trade Union's pushing for the emancipation of the difficult workers.
According to the introduction by the staff of the Ministry of Law and Human Rights Protection of the General Trade Union of Yunnan Province, the General Trade Union of Yunnan Province has strengthened the dynamic management of the files of the difficult workers, promoted the normalization of filing, and integrated the difficult workers who meet the filing requirements into the support system in a timely manner; expanded the application channels for the difficult workers, and opened the online application platform for the difficult workers filing service using WeChat, facilitating the difficult workers to make prompt and active declarations.
During the epidemic, to help workers with difficulties in working outside the home to relieve the pressure on their lives, Yunnan Province allocated more than 13 million yuan to send warmth funds, and implemented special warmth-consoling activities for more than 6,000 workers with difficulties in working outside the home at the national level and more than 1,000 workers with difficulties at the provincial level, according to the standard of 2,000 yuan per household and 1,500 yuan per household at the provincial level.
At the same time, the provincial headquarters and the departments of human society and the Internet recruitment platforms such as the China Intellectual Property Association (CIPO) are in touch, and the recruitment information is sent to the workers in difficulty, and the employment advice and guidance services are provided.
