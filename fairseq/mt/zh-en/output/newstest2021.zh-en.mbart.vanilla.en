New China Times Review: Making Excellent Returning Rural Workers a Vital Force for Rural Revitalization - Xinhua News Agency
Talent is the key to revitalizing the countryside.
Where do you find talent?
Excellent returning migrant workers are an indispensable vital force.

Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, July 26 , by wire TITLE: Putting the excellent returning farmer workers into the countryside revitalizing vital force
The 34-year-old Zhang Xiong family lives in Fruit Garden Village, Meishan City, Sichuan Province. In 2010, he quit his ten-thousand-yuan-a-month job in Beijing and went back to his hometown to start a business.
After several years of struggle, he now manages a family-run vineyard that earns more than a million dollars a year, becoming a well-known and wealthy leader, and was elected to the village's "two-committee" class.
In recent years, under the stimulus of a series of supportive and beneficial farming policies such as the country's fight against poverty and the revitalization of the countryside, more and more excellent farmer workers like Zhang Xiang have chosen to go back to their hometowns to start up businesses, stimulating a spring flood in the countryside.
In 2019 alone, more than 8,000 village Party branch secretaries were generated from the returning excellent peasant workers, 61,000 village reserve forces were nurtured, and more than 20,000 Party members were developed, providing a powerful guarantee for winning the fight against poverty and implementing the strategy of rural revitalization.
Well-off is not well-off, the key is to look at the countryside.
Since the reform and opening-up, a large number of young and old workers in rural China have gone out to work to increase their income, and some have founded their own enterprises by struggling.
But objectively, it also leads to rural "emptyness" to varying degrees, especially the weakening of rural grassroots organizations, and the village party branch secretaries and party members' teams all show the characteristics of "one old and one young", i.e., age aging, low education, the village party organization leader's team is not strong, and the problem of non-acceptance of green and yellow is prominent.
If the countryside talents and other factors have been flowing to the city one-way, the countryside is in a state of "bloodlessness" and "anemia" for a long time, revival is an empty word.
Attracting back those peasants who are capable, conscious and willing to serve their hometowns, guiding them back to their hometowns to start a business and become leaders in making them rich, and cultivating them into Party members and rural cadres, and enriching the cadre corps at the grass-roots level, are the measures to solve the problem of the incompatibility between the cadre corps at the grass-roots level and the Party organization at the grass-roots level.
Outstanding migrant workers will be attracted back, but they will also be able to stay and do well.
In recent years, Sichuan Province has started to crack down on the establishment of the peasant workers' party and, on the basis of strict selection criteria, has established a system of attracting excellent peasant workers, guaranteeing their services, training them to improve their skills, selecting and using them, etc., so that they can improve their abilities, secure their jobs and have hope for life.
This year is the year of taking office, which is the year of fighting the fight against poverty and strengthening the link between fighting poverty and revitalizing the countryside, and talents are the key factors.
The Party committee governments at all levels should attach great importance to this group of outstanding returning rural migrant workers and, through comprehensive measures, make them into a workforce that can stay alive, fight and carry on, and a vital army, thus providing strong organizational guarantees and talent support for rural people escaping poverty and striving for well-being and development.
Because of the epidemic, this year's graduation ceremony is a very special one. On July 11,bilibili Summer Graduation Song Festival brings a special live performance for the graduates, old wolf, Park Shu, Li Yuchun, Mao Qiao and other musicians to the graduation ceremony singing and blessing.
Seal Wu, a well-known up-and-comer, also brought along "Wild Grass," a lyrical song he wrote based on Lu Xun's collection of prose poems of the same name, which is very popular among young people.
Due to the epidemic, many graduates have not been able to experience the ceremony of digging ears and awarding degree certificates on the spot, they have transferred the ceremony to the Internet.
The two-and-a-half-hour concert peaked at over 35 million live viewers, according to data.
"Follow your heart, seize the opportunity, ignore the consequences, sometimes there will be unexpected gains.
Although it is a graduation song party, many songs also make the unfit graduates moved.
"The whole scene really makes me want to cry. Everyone's youth is full of beauty and regret, but it's worth remembering.
Beijing's natural ecology continues to attract more than 500 species of wildlife to " settle " - China News Agency
Wang Sishou Responsible Editor: Wang Sishou
Capital's natural ecology continues to flourish, attracting wildlife to the city's "settlement"
There are over 500 species of wildlife in Beijing
In recent years, as the capital's natural ecosystem continues to improve, the species and number of wildlife have continued to increase, according to a Beijing Youth Daily reporter with the City Gardens and Greening Bureau.
At present, the number of terrestrial vertebrate wildlife inhabiting Beijing has increased to more than 500 species, including nationally protected species such as brown cockroaches, black storks, and nationally protected species such as gazelle, big swan, grey crane and duck.
Whether planted in one of the city’s forests in the second ring, or in small wetlands embedded between buildings, it not only brings the city’s citizens a sense of wilderness, but also attracts wildlife to “settle” in the city.
During the peak of summer, it is located in the Yanshan Mountains in the northwest of Yanqing District in the Matsuyama National Nature Reserve.
A swallow was playing by the stream, and beside him two badgers were fighting with each other.
As of the end of 2019, there are 178 species of wildlife living in the green sea covering more than 6,200 hectares, including gold carvings of nationally protected animals and scoop chickens and antelopes of nationally protected animals. Nearly a third of the city's wildlife species can be seen here, said Hu Qiali, director of the Matsuyama National Nature Reserve Administration.
"In Matsuyama, the wild animals are the real 'owners' and our staff can only be the 'guardians' at best," he said.
Mr. Hu said more than 30 professional rangers patrol the area every day, along 16 carefully designed protected routes, and make a "round trip" every month, travelling almost the entire day to get to know the wildlife on the ground.
"In addition to documenting biodiversity, inspections include installation of artificial bird nests, rescue of injured wildlife, installation of outdoor infrared cameras, and so on.
More than 200 infrared cameras have been installed in Matsuyama National Nature Reserve to record the state of wildlife in the forest.
As the biodiversity of the protected areas has become increasingly rich in recent years, more and more wild animals have been featured in the film, and leopard cats, rhinos and badgers have become regular guests.
Zhang Zhiming, director of the Wildlife and Wetland Protection Department of the Beijing Botanical Greening Bureau, said that the number of terrestrial vertebrate wildlife in Beijing has increased from 461 species in 1994 to more than 500 species today.
The appearance of wild animals in the city is becoming more and more common, and it is closely related to the recent upgrading of urban greening in the capital.
In particular, a new round of million-acre afforestation and greening construction, which began in 2018, proposes to reshape the urban ecological environment, enhance the ecological function of forest lands and green spaces, and highlight the "near nature" concept.
Planning efforts are made to interact with the surrounding greenery to facilitate wildlife "going to visit friends and relatives," and the trees planted are also the animals' favorite honey source and food source plants.
Black Land "Seed" Out of Agricultural Modernization - Xinhua News Agency
Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, July 26, by wire TITLE: Black land "seed" to modernize agriculture
In the summer, two jets of sprayed pharmaceuticals flew past the 10,000-acre high-yield demonstration field in the second operation station of Friendship Farm's Fifth Management Area, forming two white lines.
The aircraft can spray pesticides on more than 6,000 acres of farmland a day, eight times more efficient than drones and hundreds of times more efficient than man-made ones, said Kong Lingqiang, head of the operations station.
This farm is located in the territory of Friendship County, Heilongjiang Province, China's first food-producing province, from the past "ha-ha" of cutting rice through to the present "long-long" motor sound, Chinese traditional agriculture and farming in this black soil belt has been transformed.
In addition to aircraft, satellites are also used in modern agricultural production on Friendship Farms.
On the one hand, they use satellite remote sensing technology to achieve accurate fertilization, reduce agricultural inputs and reduce pollution; on the other hand, satellite navigation technology can improve the standardized operation level of agricultural machinery fields, Mr. Kong said.
During rice production this year, the farm expanded its satellite-navigated, unmanned-seedling operation from 3,000 acres last year to 30,000 acres.
The technology allows seedlings to be planted more evenly, maximizes the use of sunlight and arable land resources, and saves $16 per acre in labor costs.
In agricultural production, farms have tried new technologies such as informatization and intelligentization, forming the largest agricultural machinery group in China from the ground to the sky.
According to statistics, at present, the total number of farm machinery holdings is 49,000 units (pieces), and the combined mechanization rate of the fields reaches 99.8%.
Agricultural machinery operations have achieved 100% GPS satellite navigation, 100% precision sowing in arid fields, and 100% operation of large-scale locomotives in arid fields.
Green agriculture, intelligent agriculture and digital agriculture are the directions of agricultural modernization.
said Friendship Farm Manager Liu Hualian.
The key to agricultural modernization lies in scientific and technological progress.
In recent years, Heilongjiang Agricultural Reclamation, which is represented by farms, has played a demonstration and leading role as a "carrier" of modern large-scale agriculture, and has initially established a modern agricultural industrial system dominated by scaled-up cultivation, standardized production, and industrialized operation.
In the outskirts of Friendship County, there is an agricultural machinery exhibition park covering an area of 350,000 square meters.
More than 140 agricultural machinery (parts) imported and used by Heilongjiang Agricultural Reclamation have been exhibited here.
These agricultural machinery and farms witnessed China's agricultural modernization development course.

Xinhua News Agency reporters Chen Shangying, Wang Liwu, Liu Xiacun
More than four o'clock in the afternoon on July 25, Fu Qunbao, dressed in mud-stained rubber shoes, from the front to the back, and his wife, Zhou Yan, went back and forth to tidy up.
"I got a phone call from the village cadres asking me to move, and I'm still grazing in the fields.
Fu Qunbao says he has turned over more than 60 acres of land and planted rice. He is in good shape right now. " Yesterday I took some medicine and I haven't packed any tools yet.
Fu Qunbao pointed to the pesticide sprayer in the corner. No one wants to be flooded at home.
To cope with the continuing high water level pressure and possible heavy rainfall in Neshu Lake, Hefei, Anhui Province, is preparing to open the Jiangkou River joint pond, where Fu Kunbao's family resides, on the 26th.
Jiangkou River Lianwei is located in Hexi County, adjacent to the Great Embankment of Lake Nest.
Thousands of villagers in Yandian Township and Sanhe Township need to be relocated.
As of 16 o'clock on the 25th, the water level of Nest Lake, the fifth largest freshwater lake in China, remained at a high level of 13.2 meters, exceeding the guaranteed water level of 0.7 meters.
The kitchen was clean and tidy, with a bowl of cucumbers on the table and eggs and some hazelnuts in the fridge.
“I didn’t expect to move, and the water in Jiangkou River looks fine.”
Zhou Yan said the house is flat, some large objects have not yet thought about where to put.
"Put your valuables in order, and put refrigerators and TV sets in your high-rise neighbors' or relatives' homes for a while.
The village official Wang Li stabbed Fu Qunbao with an idea.
Wang was responsible for the transfer and resettlement of 13 villagers, notifying each of them and confirming their resettlement plans.
The nearest settlement to the Fu Kun Bao family is Yandian Township Su Xiao Primary School, about 2 km away.
In addition to large items, Fu Qunbao has two headaches at home more than 1,000 kilograms of food and some newly bought furniture.
"The food is being hauled to relatives' houses, and the furniture can't be moved.
After some discussion, the couple put a stool under the newly bought bed and raised it about half a meter.
At 6:00 p.m., Fu Qunbao began to transport things to relatives' homes in a tricycle, and Zhou Yan continued to pack at home.
More than eleven o'clock in the evening, the couple looked around the house, pulled on the electrical lock, and prepared to settle down.
I hope the water will recede sooner.
said Fu Qunbao.
On July 26, at 9:30 a.m., reporters in the Jiangkou River Lianwei site saw that the locals had made preparations before the flooding.

The game's official trailer was released on YouTube on July 11, 2011.
Sports director Zhang Ji-ko and sports assistant Lin Xiao-taek cross-platform, Lin Dan and Fu Yuan Hui commented on each other's styles, while the "massive-scale" power-pull device of the hard core on the scene, let the program "burning" full force.
In the first episode, eleven athletic teenagers appear on the power circuit, and while the appearance of the spectators is stunning, the "strong conflict," "strong confrontation," and "strong heart" on the arena are also attracting attention.
Among them, "Strong Conflict" comes from super-A sports student Jo Wen-ichi, who openly provoked Xu Zhibin, who is called "the beautiful man" in the track before the match, choking Xu Zhibin's appearance should go to the dance program, even releasing the harsh words "Don't cry if you lose."
A remark gave both the youngsters and the sports directors of the field a breath of fresh air.
And the "strong confrontation" is more like a fairy fight, the so-called "great demon king" Sun Jianqi meets the equally strong Zhang Xindong, a strong confrontation.
And their identity is unexpected, Sun Jianqi is a fitness-loving actor, Zhang Xindong is a veteran of the special forces, three-time recipient of the Warrior Medal.
At the start of the match, the two teenagers pulled out the small sticks as fast as they could, and the long-lasting confrontation on the big sticks made the spectators sweat for them.
Under the tense conditions, Zhang Jiko, as one of the sports directors of the Youth Sports Club, also watches the match carefully.
In the commentary section, he is also very careful, to the losing side of the game juvenile patience encouragement, to help in the process of replay every mistake point.
And sports assistant Lin Xiaojia is a fancy assistant, she does not hide the appreciation of the youth of the face value strength online.
It is especially admirable when we learn about the daily training of sports teenagers overloaded.
Likewise, Lin Dan and Fu Yuanhui, the sports directors, have their own styles, with the lazy “prophetess,” and the nervous, smiling “flood girl.”
In addition, Jick Junyi and Liu Ye as sports assistants, also around sports teenagers created a lot of laughable topics.
Parish Volunteers Recognize Arson at Church of Notre Dame in France - China News
On July 18, the famous St. Peter and St. Paul's Cathedral, a jewel of religious and historical buildings in Nantes, France, was severely damaged in a fire and the organ completely destroyed, foreign media reported.
Local time, on 26 April, Attorney General Nate announced that a parish volunteer who was responsible for guarding the cathedral had been indicted on charges of "inciting arson and destruction".
He has admitted that it was he who lit the fire in the church.
The 39-year-old parish volunteer from Rwanda admitted he lit three fires in the cathedral at night, local prosecutors said.
The man's lawyer said the arsonists now regretted doing so.
Several years ago, the man entered France by way of asylum, was given shelter in the diocese where the fire occurred, and was taken into the church.
Prosecutors noted that he had recently attempted to renew his visa and was in dialogue with the police.
But the church said it still didn't believe that a believer who was usually very kind and smiling, but didn't talk much, would destroy the church he loved so much.
On the day of the fire on July 18, the volunteer had been questioned by the police because of an illogical question in his account, but was later released.
The picture shows the firefighters rescuing the victims on the scene.
On the evening of the 25th, the man was again interrogated, as new evidence was obtained from a professional engineer at the laboratory of the Central Bureau of Police in Paris.
This time, the man confessed to arson.
If convicted of arson, the suspect could face a 10-year prison sentence and a €150,000 fine.
The fire reportedly caused severe damage to the cathedrals of St. Pierre and St. Paul, where the organ was completely destroyed and the stained glass windows behind the organ were severely damaged.
The chief architect of the French Historical Preservation Building, Jean-Baptiste Brunet, estimated that the restoration of the cathedral would take at least three years.
"U.S. unilateralism undermines U.S.-China relations" (Press release).
On the morning of July 24, the Chinese Foreign Ministry informed the U.S. Embassy in China that China has decided to revoke the permit for the establishment and operation of the U.S. Consulate General in Chengdu and to make specific requests for the Consulate General to cease all operations and activities.
The international public opinion believes that the unilateralist measures adopted by the United States have caused serious trouble in the relations between China and the United States, and that China's response to the unreasonable provocation by the United States and the adoption of countermeasures are legitimate and necessary.
'U.S. unilateralism has damaged the bridge of understanding between the peoples of China and the U.S.,' said Andrea Borges, director of the Center for China Studies at the University of Chile's Institute for International Studies.
China's announcement of the closure of the US Consulate General in Chengdu is contrary to U.S. unilateral measures and in line with diplomatic practice.
Patricio Giusto, professor at the Catholic University of Argentina and director of the Center for Sino-Arab Studies, said China's decision was a legitimate and necessary countermeasure to the U.S.'s previous provocation, and not aimed at ordinary Americans.
The US is trying to divert American attention by pressuring China to cover up its weaknesses in dealing with the new crown disease.
'The U.S. has taken a provocative diplomatic stance, which has caused serious trouble in relations between China and the U.S., and the two countries face serious challenges,' said Banpong Suryono, president of the Asia Innovation Research Center of the Indonesian think tank.
China's notification to the United States of the closure of its Consulate General in Chengdu is a normal countermeasures, in line with diplomatic practice, reflecting China's principled position of resolutely safeguarding its own interests, as well as the rationality and efficiency of Chinese diplomacy.
Tanzanian current affairs commentator Francis Semwinza said China's decision was a legitimate and necessary response to the U.S. provocation.
If China-US relations are to return to normal, the US should take the initiative to improve relations with China and stop interfering in China's internal affairs.
The United States should focus on how to win economically and politically with China and how to benefit both peoples and the international community as a whole.
Ali Yousef, executive director of the Sudan-based Arab-China Friendship Association, said the countermeasures China was forced to take were a legitimate and necessary response to America's unreasonable actions, in line with international law and the basic norms of international relations, as well as diplomatic practice.
The US had previously demanded the closure of China's consulate-general in Houston, in grave violation of international law and basic norms of international relations.
It is hoped that the U.S. will reverse its earlier decision and create the necessary conditions for normal relations between the two countries.
'The U.S.'s bigger strategic intention is to block China and prevent it from continuing to rise,' Singapore's United Morning Post said in an editorial.
Faced with the increasing pressure from the U.S., China, while reluctant to see Sino-US relations continue to deteriorate, has had to take countermeasures.

Xinhua news agency reported by wire in Guangzhou on July 26 (reporter Mao Xin) that the Guangdong Maritime Police Bureau, in conjunction with the Guangzhou Customs and Public Security Department, has recently cracked down on a large-scale oil smuggling syndicate, initially verifying that the syndicate has smuggled about 120,000 tons of oil since 2019, with a case value of about 800 million yuan and tax evasion amounting to about 2.4 billion yuan.
The Guangdong Marine Police Bureau and the Customs and Excise Department have gradually worked out the division of labour and organizational structure of the gang.
On July 8, the maritime police, customs and public security departments conducted unified interception operations in Guangzhou, Foshan, etc., and the Pearl River estuary, respectively, to seize four suspected smuggling vessels on the spot, seize 4,700 tons of finished oil from the vessels and oil refineries involved, respectively, and freeze a number of financial accounts.
It is understood that in this joint operation, a total of eight ships and two helicopters were deployed, divided into several operational teams to cooperate in combating maritime smuggling, land-based illegal operations and other links, and 35 major criminal suspects were all on the case.
The case is currently being investigated further.
The head of the Guangdong Maritime Police Bureau said that in the future, it will continue to maintain a high-pressure situation, combat all kinds of smuggling illegal and criminal activities at sea, and maintain good order in the waters under its jurisdiction.
Hurricane Hanna made landfall in the state or triggered river surges and mountain flooding - CNN
Hurricane Hanna made landfall in Texas at 5:00 p.m. local time on July 25, causing heavy rainfall, river flooding and potentially life-threatening mountain flooding.
The National Hurricane Center said Hurricane Hanna was expected to carry heavy rainfall, sweeping parts of southern and northeastern Texas, raising rainfall or triggering stream surges and life-threatening flash flooding.
Hurricane Hanna reportedly affected the area south of Corpus Christi to the mouth of the Grand River, and the Rio Grande Valley was likely to experience widespread flooding.
"Any hurricane is a huge challenge," Governor Robert Abbott said on Sunday.
Thirty-two counties in the state were declared disaster-prone as a result of the hurricane.
The city of Corpus Christi, with a population of over 320,000, has closed its libraries and museums, and residents are on the move.
Mr. Abbott also said the hurricane could not be allowed to cause more deaths in Texas at a time when the state was suffering from a new crown disease.
It was reported that rainfall in southern Texas was expected to reach 6 to 12 inches overnight on the 26th, with 3 to 5 inches in northern Texas and coastal Louisiana.
Due to global warming and other factors, Hanna formed earlier than the previous Atlantic hurricane season.
Typically, the first Atlantic hurricane does not form until mid-August.
Poland to Withdraw from Europe's Violence Against Women Treaty
The Polish Ministry of Justice said Saturday that Poland would take steps next week to withdraw from the European treaty to prevent violence against women.
The right-wing Polish cabinet said the treaty violated the rights of students' parents by requiring schools to teach students about gender issues.
At a press conference, Poland's Attorney General, Piotr Joblow, said his Ministry of Justice would ask the Ministry of Labour and the Family to begin withdrawing from the treaty on Monday.
The treaty was also known as the Istanbul Convention.
"The treaty contains elements that we think are harmful in terms of their morphology," Joublot said.
The Polish ruling Law and Justice Party and its ruling coalition partners have a close alliance with the Roman Catholic Church, advocating a conservative social agenda.
During his successful re-election campaign this month, Polish President Aleksander Duda made hostility to gay rights one of his top priorities.
On Friday, tens of thousands of Poles, most of them women, held protests in Warsaw and other cities against the withdrawal from the convention.
One of the organizers of the protest, Liam Patt, said during a protest march in Warsaw that "the aim of withdrawing from the treaty is to legalize domestic violence".
Some protesters held banners that read, "The Law and Justice Party is women's hell."
The leader of the Law and Justice Party has long complained about the Istanbul Convention.
Poland's previous centre-right government ratified the convention in 2015.
The government of the Law and Justice Party says the treaty does not respect religion and requires liberal social policies to be taught in schools.
So far, however, the party has not decided to withdraw from the convention.

The recruitment office of the Jiangxi Provincial People's Government has recently made it clear that priority will be given to those individuals or their children who stand out in the flood-fighting and disaster-rescue tasks, meet the requirements for recruitment, and pass both medical examinations and political examinations, Xinhua news agency reported by wire in Nanchang on July 26.
"After the applicants are registered, we will jointly verify the applicants' communities, the armed forces of the streets and the military recruitment offices in Xunyang District and assign priority to them," he said.
Wang Hui, deputy minister of the People's Armed Forces Department in Xunyang District of Jiujiang City, said they had concentrated on organizing a three-day medical examination for young people who had been affected by the flooding since 25th.
Zhou Qianfan, a 22-year-old university graduate from Xunyang District, Jiujiang City, whose mother is a community worker and whose father is a retired soldier in the Air Force, has been on duty for more than a decade.
These days, when I see in the news that the people's children and young soldiers are bravely defending their hometown against the floods, I want to be like them.
Zhou said he had had a military dream since he was a child, and through this flood fighting strengthened his determination to enlist in the army.
The city of Jiujiang also uses flood prevention as a "living teaching material" for recruiting soldiers.They use the community as a unit to call on young people to volunteer for patrolling and checking dikes, on duty and on guard duty, and now realize the nature and purpose of the People's Armed Forces and strengthen their confidence in joining the army and reporting to the state.
"We hope to motivate more young people to join the army and create a good social atmosphere for them to take part in the mission and join the army," said Luo Jiuyu, Political Commissioner of the People's Armed Forces Department in Xunyang District, Jiujiang City.
According to the Vietnam News Agency, Mr. Grewley believes Vietnam has made a significant contribution to ASEAN's development over the past 25 years.
Vietnam is not only a responsible member of ASEAN, but also an ASEAN locomotive.
Mr. Gryvori said that Russia and even the AEU believe that Vietnam is contributing to ASEAN by raising its profile and promoting its image abroad.
ASEAN should therefore thank Vietnam, he stressed.
He said analysts had endorsed the peace initiative put forward by Vietnam.
Viet Nam is willing to share its experience with ASEAN countries and propose constructive peace measures to address the problems facing the Asia-Pacific region, including the Eastern Sea issue.
With regard to cooperation between Viet Nam and Russia in the framework of ASEAN, Mr. Grivoli believed that Viet Nam supported cooperation between Russia and ASEAN and helped Russia to benefit from such cooperation.
The Eurasian Economic Union, including Russia, will be able to enter the ASEAN market after signing a free-trade agreement with Vietnam.
He proposed maximizing the free-trade area between the AEU and ASEAN countries, thereby creating a platform for economic and security stability.
He also believes that Russia, Vietnam and ASEAN are on track to achieve their goals.
Between now and the end of 2020, Beijiang Province will have the necessary conditions, especially in infrastructure, human resources and land, to welcome inflows of foreign capital, especially multinational groups with value chains and transfer of advanced technologies.
In addition, Beijiang Province will submit to the Prime Minister of the Government the proposal for investment in infrastructure construction and operational projects in Vietnam's industrial zone and approve the document on the comprehensive plan for the development of Vietnam's industrial zone by 2020 to include the two industrial-urban-services zones in the province, Anshan-Beilong and Anhui.
At the same time, Beijiang province has been working hard to accelerate the progress of various projects, especially infrastructure construction and operation projects in industrial park clusters such as Hefu, Gwangju, and Shuangxi-Nehuang, forming land funds for attracting investment.
By 2020, the Northern Jiang Province Bureau of Trade and Industry will be involved in formulating proposals for the designation of industrial zones and industrial clusters to be incorporated into provincial planning.
The province has determined that the development of clusters of industrial parks will be combined with the safeguarding of national defense, the protection of the ecological environment and the safeguarding of food security, thereby contributing to the balanced development of industry; it will have comprehensive electricity, water supply, transportation and telecommunications infrastructure, and will be combined with other social infrastructure such as urban construction, trade services, workers' housing and medical and health care, and education.
In the industrial areas, Beijiang province has focused on appealing for investment projects in high-tech and clean technology in the fields of electricity, electronics, telecommunications equipment, precision machinery, and auxiliary industries.
In clusters of industrial parks, the province has called for small- and medium-scale investment projects in the production and utilization of local labor, especially in agricultural products and food processing.
In the future, Beijiang will focus on accelerating investment in the infrastructure of Beijiang Logistics Center, which will be developed in synergy with the clusters of industrial parks, in order to optimize the flow of goods and money and help reduce production costs, increase the value of goods, optimize supply chains and develop multimodal transportation, thereby creating an attractive environment for investors to invest in the province.
Russian Armed Helicopter Carrier-52M (Russian: Кар-52М) was the first Russian armed helicopter carrier to be launched at the end of the year.
According to a Russian defense ministry plan, the upgraded version of the Russian armed helicopter, the Ka-52M, will be converted for the first time in December and shipped out of the factory, with significant improvements in reconnaissance, communications and weapons performance.
The first two of the upgraded versions are undergoing refurbishment at the Far Eastern Helicopter Manufacturing Plant of the Russian Progressive Aerospace Group, with national testing and refit completion expected by October 2022.
It is understood that the above-mentioned upgrade work Russian experts introduced, the "ancestor" of the "Super Short Kiss Crocodile" - Wu Zika-52 was formally installed in November 2011, the aircraft model exposed some weaknesses in use, this modification upgrade is to "complement the short board".
Compared to the Ka-52, the Ka-52M will be partially armored with new, weight-resistant defense materials, its cockpit will be reinforced and equipped with new missile-defense equipment, thereby increasing the likelihood of survival in the battlefield; more powerful generators will be installed to power more sophisticated airborne electronic equipment; optical and electro-optical systems will be upgraded to detect and identify more distant battlefield targets; a new lightweight multi-purpose missile with a range of 20 kilometers will be equipped with the main attack armoured fighting vehicles and reinforced concrete fortifications, which will increase the range of similar missiles used directly by the Russian armed forces by about one-fold; and its defense weapons and communications equipment will be as common as possible with the M-28NM armed helicopters that can
In addition, the Ka-52M will have more advanced electronic guidance systems, weapon sighting systems, and navigation equipment.
Russian experts also said it was of concern that the Ka-52M would be equipped with communications equipment to communicate with UAVs, thereby obtaining real-time information transmitted by nearby UAVs in the air, such as images taken by the UAVs on the helicopter's cabin screen.
As planned, the Ka-52M's pilots would be able to directly control the UAVs that would accompany them, thereby improving the pilot's command of the battlefield situation and the guidance of long-range missiles.
According to Russian media reports, Russian Deputy Minister of Defense Sergey Krivoruchko said last December that the Russian Ministry of Defense plans to buy more than 110 military helicopters-52M by 2027.

In the past two weeks, the number of new coronary heart disease cases in Spain has risen sharply, with thousands of new cases reported in the past few days.
The British government temporarily decided late Saturday (25 July) to remove Spain from its safe travel list from 0600 local time on 26 July, requiring 14 days of isolation for people entering the UK from Spain.
When British tourists on holiday in Spain heard of the decision, they were surprised, worried, and even angry, because the news came unexpectedly.
Britain's Transport Secretary, Grant Shapps, is reportedly also on holiday in Spain.
Prior to the British announcement of the isolation measures, Norway had also announced a 10-day isolation for returnees from Spain.
France and Belgium have advised their residents to abandon plans for holidays ahead of Barcelona and the surrounding area.
Beaches in these areas are crowded and social distances between people are not maintained, and the police needed to take measures to reduce the number of beach visitors.
Tourism is an important pillar of Spain's economy
Spain: It's safe here
Spain's foreign ministry said Sunday that the country's epidemic was under control in response to the UK's decision.
"Spain is safe, not only for Spaniards, but also for tourists," Spanish Foreign Minister Rancha Gonzalez Laya told the media.
The Spanish government will try to persuade the British government to exclude the Balearic Islands and the Canary Islands from the isolation measures.
The reason is that the infection rates in these two tourist destinations are much lower than in the UK.
To prevent the epidemic from spreading, Spain's Catalonia region has also reintroduced a foot-and-mouth ban.
Tourism is an important pillar of Spain's economy, and Spain is one of the most popular holiday destinations for British tourists.
Britain's decision is expected to have a major impact on Spain's tourism industry.

The first day: Beijing temporary high-temperature hot summer opens rainfall pattern - Official website
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 26, by wire (journalist Ni Yuanjin) July 26 is the first day of this year's "Zhongfu".
Heavy winds and torrential rains in the early hours of the 26th scattered the heat and humidity that had plagued Beijing for days, and a new round of rainfall would last for several days.
At 11 a.m. on 26 June, the Beijing Meteorological Observatory reported that there were dispersed showers (with weak thunderstorms) in Beijing, with a maximum temperature of 27 °C (27 °F) during the day and a low to moderate rainfall (with weak thunderstorms) at night, with a minimum temperature of 23 °C (23 °F).
In the previous 24-25 days, the city of Beijing was in the high temperature blue alert, the day's maximum temperature in most areas was around 37 °C, locally over 40 °C.
It is the hottest day of the year, and the hottest in the middle of the year, when the Chinese people call it the bitter summer.
At the end of the day, the houses are filled with grain, and the folk say, "One dumpling, two dumplings."
According to the current forecast, it will be cloudy and rainy in Beijing for the next three days.
The weather department advised the public to minimize mountaineering and avoid geological disasters.
It is understood that this year's ambush will last for 20 days, starting on July 26 and ending on August 14.
After entering the "middle trap", people will feel weak and hungry.
In the diet, you can choose green beans, coconuts and other foods that have a clearing heat and heat-relieving, healthy spleen and stomach-opening effect, as well as bitter foods such as bitter cabbage and bitter melon, which can help to increase appetite and dispel heat.

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued an emergency airworthiness directive on April 24, requiring an emergency inspection of approximately 2,000 Boeing 737NG and 737 Classic aircraft registered in the United States.
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said it had received four reports of aircraft engines being parked in the air on the 737NG and 737 Classic models to date, prompting an emergency inspection of aircraft that had been parked for seven or more consecutive days and that had flown fewer than 11 flights since re-entry into service.
The Federal Aviation Administration warned that if the Class 5 check valve of all two engines on the aircraft were damaged, it could be stuck in the open position, causing the aircraft to lose all power and unable to restart the engine.
The aviation regulator has ordered airlines to replace this key component before the aircraft can be put back into service once it is found to be corroded.
Boeing responded later that day that the outbreak of the new plague had reduced travel demand, resulting in many passenger flights being blocked or used less frequently, and that “return valves were more susceptible to corrosion.”
Boeing also says it has advised airlines to inspect the aircraft involved in the instruction, and will provide assistance with repairs and replacement of check valves if problems are found.
Major U.S. carriers usually fly more than one flight a day, but large numbers of flights have been grounded in the wake of the outbreak, the Associated Press reported, and some have reopened as demand for travel has grown slowly lately.
The Federal Aviation Administration did not release the details of four aerial parking reports.
Alaska Airlines revealed one of the incidents later that night.
The airline said in a statement that an engine suddenly went out on a July 15 flight from Seattle, Washington, to Austin, Texas, and the aircraft finally made an emergency landing at Austin Airport.
Alaska Airlines said it had replaced the aircraft's engines and had inspected six aircraft's engines as directed by the Federal Aviation Administration.
American Airlines, United Airlines and Southwest Airlines said on Tuesday that their aircraft had no engine failures associated with the air intake valve.
Four American Airlines aircraft will be inspected and 28 United Airlines aircraft will be inspected.
Delta Air Lines said it would inspect 20 of its aircraft, but did not say if there had been any engine failures.
Several media outlets reported that the Federal Aviation Administration's Emergency Airworthiness Directive was another blow to Boeing.
Indonesian Lion Airlines and Ethiopian Airlines each crashed their Boeing 737 MAX aircraft in October 2018 and March 2019, killing a total of 346 people.
The series was subsequently discontinued worldwide, and production ceased in January and resumed in May.
In June, Federal Aviation Administration Director Steve Dickson admitted that, in the case of the 737 MAX, the agency had “made a mistake” in regulating Boeing.

There's a new variety on the line.
The interactive knowledge-sharing program "Dingdong Online!Good Teacher" will be broadcast on Hunan TV from July 20.
It is understood that the program will create a new all-age youth classroom, a group of colorful and talented teachers will compete, challenging the output of interesting knowledge.
Unlike the serious impression in the public mind of the former teacher group, "Ding on line! Good teacher" is a collection of a group of knowledge representatives of both beauty and talent.
They are both an example of youthful knowledge from various disciplines, or a group of all-powerful "dancers" who can shake burdens and are good at allegorizing to the joy.
In the program, the group of excellent young knowledge role models as "Knowledge Sharing Officers" will challenge interesting knowledge classrooms.
They need to engage audiences by demonstrating the most interesting aspects of their subjects through an attitude-based knowledge output.
In addition, a group of people of all ages will ask questions on the spot, which will increase the difficulty of teaching the "Knowledge Sharing Officer" and add a little bit of excitement to the program.
Among the "knowledge-sharing officers," Li Yongle, a physics teacher at the secondary school affiliated with the People's University of China, Zhang Xuefeng, a renowned instructor in examination and research, and Wang Lei, a history teacher with ten years of professional experience, are outstanding young teachers who will show off their "hard core" knowledge in various disciplines to the audience in unexpected ways, it was revealed.
In addition, the program also invited economics professor Xue Zhaofeng as the "knowledge initiator" of the program, jointly with "Ding Dong Assistant Professor" Du Hai Tao and Jin Mengjia, to talk about youth with the audience, creating a "public lesson for all youth".

Mr Cheung said the free virus testing provided by the HKSAR Government to certain high-risk groups, namely the elderly, disabled and nursing home staff, restaurant staff, taxi drivers and property management staff, had been fully implemented, involving more than 400,000 people.
He was very concerned about the outbreaks in the homes of the elderly, and the Government had arranged special temporary quarantine centres for the residents of the homes.
He said the Government was in the process of constructing quarantine facilities near the Bamboo Bay Quarantine Centre on Lantau Island in the New Territories and expected to provide an additional 700 quarantine rooms by the end of September.
The Chief Executive also announced on 19th that the HKSAR Government will build more than 2,000 quarantine rooms at the Chek Lap Wan Quarantine Centre with a view to completion by the end of this year.
Additionally, 800 quarantine rooms have been put into operation and a total of 3,500 quarantine rooms are expected to be provided by the end of the year.

The "Nourishing Agent" of the History of the Standing Supplement Party and the History of New China - China News Agency

“We must let 1.4 billion people and more than 90 million Party members, especially leading cadres at all levels, study the history of the Communist Party of China and the history of New China well,” the Chinese President stressed during a recent visit to the Memorial Hall of the Four Plains Campaign.
Serious study of the history of the Party and the history of New China is a must-learn lesson for Party cadres who do not forget their original intentions and keep their mission in mind.
A vast history of the Party and New China records the hard work and glorious history of the Communist Party of China since its birth, demonstrating the faith and loyalty of the Communists, the original heart and mission that they have cast with their lives and blood.
History is the best textbook, and for Party members, the history of the Party and the history of New China is the brightest chapter in this textbook.
Every member of the Party of Communists must constantly strengthen his or her historical thinking on the basis of history and the future, based on the new quest and new mission, and take the "connecting rod" of the times and the long journey of contemporaries.
To cast the soul of history, in studying the history of the Party and the history of New China, to stick to the original mission.
Opening up the history of the Party and the history of New China is full of the constant mission of the Communists and their rock-solid conviction, which shows the simplicity of the Communists and the people together forever.
To learn the history of the Party, the history of New China, important events, important meetings and important people at close range is not only an intuitive shock to the mind, but also a baptism of thought.
For the Party cadres, if they want to continue to sharpen the mission of the original heart and preserve the advanced character, they must find the starting point and the supporting point of the original heart from the history of the Party and the history of New China, maintain a sober understanding and a firm position, excite the strength to fight valiantly for the country and the people, and ensure that the red rivers and mountains that the revolutionary forefathers struck with blood and life are passed down from generation to generation.
It is wise to study history and inherit the noble spirit in studying the history of the Party and the history of New China.
Since the founding of the Communist Party of China, it has shaped a series of great spirits such as the spirit of the Red Ship, the spirit of the Jinggang Mountain, the spirit of the Long March, the spirit of the Yan'an, the spirit of resistance to war, the spirit of the Saipao, the spirit of "two bullets, one star" and the spirit of space travel.
These great spirits under the sediments of history provide us with a powerful spiritual incentive to overcome the various risks and challenges on our Party's way forward. They are a precious spiritual treasure that cannot be broken down, scattered or snatched away.
The process of studying the history of the Party and China is the process of tempering these spirits and shaping one's own spirit.We should consciously take the lofty spirit of the revolutionary forefathers as a mirror, preserve the spiritual homeland of the Communists, lay a solid spiritual foundation for the advancement of great undertakings and the realization of great dreams, and inherit and carry forward these spirits, so as to radiate the light of a new era.
To study the history of the Party and the history of New China, we must study the history of the Party and the history of New China.
For the Party cadres, there is no history that can bring more profound warning, enlightenment and reference than the history of the Party and the history of New China.
In the history of the Party and the history of New China, we can see not only the great achievements of the old generation of revolutionaries in their determination to devote themselves to faith and indomitable striving to achieve the set goals, but also the profound lessons of certain people who have been shaken by their ideal beliefs and come to the opposite side of the revolution.
If we really want to become a firm believer and faithful practitioner of the far-reaching ideals of communism, we need to brush away the "dust" of our thoughts and guard ourselves against the "dirt." The history of the Party and the history of New China should serve as the basis for every Party member to examine and warn himself.
To learn the history of the Party and the history of New China.
"Learning the history of the Party and the history of the country is a compulsory lesson for adherence to and development of socialism with Chinese characteristics, and for pushing forward the various undertakings of the Party and the country," the Chinese President pointed out.
Looking back on history, asking the heart of the beginning, for the sake of continuing glory and moving towards the future.
Each Party member should study the history of the Party and the history of New China as a lifelong pursuit, constantly adjust his or her life course in his or her study, and take up the historical mission courageously, responsibly and actively in their respective positions.
We will continue to use the advanced achievements of the older generation of revolutionaries as a reference and guide, constantly polish the political essence of the Communists, and maintain the spirit of fighting only for the day and for the night, striving to do what is right, and striving the harder and the further forward, so that we can write a brilliant book of our own in the great quest for the Chinese nation's great revival.
"Segami Jiangnan" Searches for Poetry "Huanghe Dream"-CNN News
(China's Poverty Alleviation Story) "Set Up Jiangnan" to Search for Poetry "The Dream of the Yellow River"
Xinhua News Agency, Yinchuan, July 26 (Yang Di): "There are nine rivers of the Yellow River, sand, waves and winds from the ends of the earth.
The Yellow River, which has given rise to countless literary figures and children, has nurtured the beautiful and fertile Ningxia Plain. Now, Ningxia, which has the reputation of "sealing up Jiangnan," is pursuing the idea of "ecological priority and green development," and is pursuing the poetic "the dream of the Yellow River."
The "Bamboo Dream" of Shimizu Show
The Yellow River flows 397 kilometers through Ningxia, and is the mother river of one of the farms.
However, with the rapid advancement of industrialization and urbanization, the development, utilization and management of rivers and lakes have imbalanced, and disturbances such as excessive discharge of sewage, enclosed lake farming, and encroachment on water bodies have emerged, leading to black odor in water bodies, excessive water quality, environmental pollution, and ecological degradation.
Now, Ningxia is promoting the restoration of water ecosystem diversity, striving to restore the Yellow River's water quality.
Water treatment starts at the source.
In Yinchuan, Ningxia, the local government adopted the "tendering + sewage treatment + strict management" method, all sewage in industrial parks was treated centrally, all urban sewage treatment plants were discharged according to the standard of 1A, black odor water in urban built-up areas was basically eliminated, and the third batch of China's black odor water demonstration cities were successfully declared.
In addition, Ningxia Province implemented the river and lake lengthening system in 2017, and now it has achieved the responsibility system of the five-level river and lake lengthening system in districts, cities, counties and villages, and river and lake lengthening patrols have become the norm.
Gu Jincheng, 64, who lives in a village by the Yellow River, witnessed the change: "The water used to smell bad, but after it was cleaned up, it doesn't smell bad anymore.
Gu Jincheng said the ecological environment is better and his life is more comfortable. Now he and his family often go for a walk by the Yellow River to feel the blue sky.
The "Wetland Dream" of the Sand Gulls
Flying Birds, Green Trees, Stack Roads, Blue Water...The beautiful scenery of Fanzhong's "sand gulls flying assembly" has become a reality in Ningxia's Yellow River Wetland Park in Yinchuan.
The Yellow River passes through Ningxia and along the way forms a variety of wetlands such as river wetlands, lake wetlands, swamp wetlands, etc. It plays an important role in promoting the rational use of water resources and water ecological balance, and also becomes an important international bird migration route.
Since 2009, Ningxia's relevant departments have invested about 34.5 billion yuan in wetland protection projects.At present, Yinchuan Wetland covers an area of 19.2 million hectares, has a wetland protection rate of 78.5%, has nearly 200 natural lakes and marsh wetland, has five national wetland parks, one national urban wetland park, six autonomous region-level wetland parks, and eight city-level parks.
Liu Jinhu, deputy director of the Yinchuan Wetland Conservation Center, told reporters that wetland conservation has increased biodiversity and is particularly evident in birds. "The gull is an endangered bird, there are only more than 20,000 of them in the world, and more than 2,000 of them inhabit the Yinchuan Wetland.
At the same time, Ningxia Prefecture has legally delineated a 500-meter red line between the two sides of the Yellow River and Yinchuan sections of the wetlands protection area, stipulating that no units or individuals, except for public welfare projects, may carry out development and construction and business activities within the protected area.
Zhao Shaoyong, deputy director of the Yinchuan City Water Conservancy Service Center, said nine of Ningxia's main Yellow Drainage ditches have now achieved 100% Class IV water quality through pollution source control, integrated river and lake ecology management and end-of-river wetland construction. "Now the water is clean, the fish are swimming and the flowers are blooming," he said.
The "Dream of Drinking Water" of the People's Welfare
Ningxia Yinchuan once had an "awkward" nickname: the only city along the Yellow River that "protects the Yellow River from water shortages".
Since 2010, the city of Yinchuan has been facing the problem of water shortage during the continuous summer peak period, and the "pain of water shortage" for nearly a decade has been the summer suffering experience of many high-rise residents, but under the current situation of over-exploitation limits in major water sources and underground underground underground underground water over-exploitation funnel area, water shortage has become a problem plaguing the city of Yinchuan.
Thanks to the improvement of the quality of the Yellow River water, drinking the purified Yellow River water becomes a good solution to the local residents' drinking problems.
Mr Ding Ming, deputy director of Yinchuan City Water Supply Bureau, said that in order to improve the demand for production water for urban and rural residents in Yinchuan, Ningxia Province had launched the Yinchuan Urban and Rural West Line Water Supply Project in a timely manner, replacing the existing groundwater source with high-quality Yellow River water.
"On December 29, 2019, the water supply project was officially opened to the three districts of Yinchuan City, and in 2020, residents of Minning Town and Helan County also drank the Yellow River water."
Ding Ming said the Yinchuan water conservancy department will consider the integration of regional rural drinking water and urban water supply. "Next, we will integrate the dispersed rural water supply points into the West Line water supply project after all, and we expect to achieve the urban-rural integration of the Yinchuan region by the end of this year.

US launches first anti-subsidy investigation against China for "undervaluing the RMB exchange rate"
The U.S. Department of Commerce recently announced it had decided to initiate an anti-dumping and anti-subsidy investigation into bundles of products originating in China, as well as an investigation into "undervaluation of the yuan's exchange rate."
China's Ministry of Commerce said it was the first time the U.S. had filed an anti-subsidy inquiry into a project that allegedly undervalued the renminbi's exchange rate.
The Ministry of Commerce issued a press release on the subject on the evening of the 23rd, saying that China has a floating exchange rate system based on market supply and demand, regulated by reference to a basket of currencies, and that the market plays a decisive role in the formation of the exchange rate.
The press release stressed that, overall, the renminbi's exchange rate was reasonably balanced and not undervalued.
Since 2005, the renminbi has appreciated by more than 17% against the dollar.
According to data released by the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), the renminbi's nominal effective exchange rate rose 38% and its real effective exchange rate rose 49% between early 2005 and May 2020, making it the strongest currency in the G20 economies and one of the fastest-growing currencies in the world.
The Ministry of Commerce pointed out that the exchange rate issue exceeds the power of members to conduct anti-subsidy investigations in accordance with World Trade Organization rules.
The United States amended its rules in February to conduct anti-subsidy investigations of other countries' exchange rates, which are suspected of violating WTO rules, amid widespread opposition.
Even under U.S. law, the press release said, the applicant's claim contained a large number of errors and lacked the necessary anti-subsidy elements of financial support, benefit allocation and specialization.
China urged the US to abide by existing international rules and stop conducting anti-subsidy investigations into the so-called “undervaluation of the renminbi exchange rate.”
Due to the further rise in tensions between China and the United States, the renminbi's overseas and overseas exchange rates fell sharply against the U.S. dollar on the 22nd, falling by more than a dollar against the renminbi's exchange rate of 7.0 yuan.
The U.S. Department of Commerce's move to push up the renminbi is cause for concern.
The renminbi's spot exchange rate against the U.S. dollar rose 23 days to 6.9961, above the 7.0 mark.
The officially regulated exchange rate of the renminbi against the U.S. dollar dropped 17 basis points to 6.9938 on the 24th.

Venezuelan Foreign Minister accuses U.S. of fabricating lies against China
Mr. Areasa said the U.S. government's recent political, diplomatic, economic and public pressure on China is an unwarranted attack on a sovereign nation.
Mr. Areasa forwarded the comments to Chinese Ambassador to Venezuela Li Baorong, who posted them on his personal account earlier in the day.
"China strongly condemns the US forcible entry into the Consulate General of China in Houston, which is a serious violation of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations and the Sino-American Consular Treaty," Li said in a tweet.
Government officials, social figures and mainstream media reporters, such as Venezuelan Vice President Rodrigo Malmierca Díaz and Carlos Long, deputy foreign minister in charge of North American affairs, also relayed Li's remarks, condemning the United States' behavior as a serious violation of international law.
On 26 January, the day before President Donald Trump's fifth State of the Union Address (SONA), more than 80,000 new cases of pneumonia were diagnosed in the Philippines, bringing the number of confirmed cases to 25 for the Department of Public Information (PCOO) and its staff.
To this end, the PCOO has specially prepared a working group that has not had any contact with the diagnosis staff, in conjunction with President Duterte's press release on SONA.
PCOO Minister Martin Andanar said in an interview with DZBB Radio on 26 April that two sets of plans had been prepared for the release of the SONA format by President Duterte.
Under Plan A, Duterte will deliver SONA at the Batasang Pambansa building in Quezon City on the afternoon of the 27th.
Due to the epidemic, only 50 seats were reserved for some members of the cabinet and legislators, and a dedicated video conference room was set up for other cabinet members, local government officials, and others to watch.
All attendees must pass a rapid security check before entering the Capitol building.
As soon as one of the attendees tested positive, Plan B was activated, with President Duterte announcing SONA at the Presidential Palace in Maracaibo, and fewer seats were allocated.
As usual, SONA broadcasts live to Fiji nationwide.
At the time of writing, the President's Office had not yet confirmed whether Duterte's family would attend SONA.
Mr. Andanar said President Duterte's SONA will focus on how the government will lead the Philippines in responding to the new cholera epidemic and restoring social and economic life, as well as on his commitments to fight anti-government corruption, illicit drugs and poverty reduction.
Mr Duterte will also outline the government's other plans, including creating more jobs, revitalizing the economy, promoting education, and helping Filipino workers overseas who are suffering from the epidemic.
Yinchuan: Classified measures to support kindergarten teachers' team stability - Official website
Yinchuan, Ningxia Prefecture, has yet to reopen kindergartens as a result of the epidemic, Xinhua news agency said by wire on July 26 (reporter Ai Fumei).In particular, the increasing pressure on privately run kindergartens' funds has had some impact on the stability of the kindergarten teachers' workforce and their future sustainable development.
To this end, Yinchuan City has adopted a number of measures such as pre-allocation of subsidized funds for publicly-run kindergartens, subsidized job security for non-publicly-run kindergartens, and reduced and exempted rents for publicly-run kindergartens to support teachers in these kindergartens.
According to the relevant policies of Yinchuan City, if, during the epidemic period, the organizers of public kindergartens (which have been converted into public kindergartens after the management of supportive kindergartens in urban areas) pay basic living expenses of not less than $1,660 per month to teaching staff in accordance with the minimum wage standards of the three districts, the municipal finance will allocate a six-month subsidy fund to settle teachers' salaries and social insurance expenses in accordance with the standard of $1,000 per student per year for the average funds for public kindergartens.
For non-public private kindergartens, which also provide basic living expenses of not less than $1,660 per person per month to teaching staff, Yinchuan City will allocate six-month subsidy funds as a fixed-term subsidy fund for nursery teachers according to the standard of $500 per student per year.
At the same time, for private kindergartens rented from state-owned assets, Yinchuan City will reduce the rent for three months during the immunization prevention and control period, and encourage developers and other leasing entities to assume social responsibilities.
Formation of the Third Flood of the Yangtze River in 2020 Detailed and Practical Response Measures of the Ministry of Water Resources - China New Network
Xinhua News Agency (Beijing Daily News, July 26) The third flood of the Yangtze River in 2020 formed on July 26.
The Minister of Water Resources, Mr O Keng Ping, at the meeting requested that the Three Gorges Reservoirs be fine-tuned to take into account the influx of water from the upper reaches of the Yangtze River and Lake Dongting, that the misalignment of the reservoirs be implemented, that the reservoirs be maintained in order to prepare for possible heavy floods, and that the flood protection of the lower and middle reaches of the river and the important embankment of Lake Dongting be ensured.
According to forecasts, over the next three days, there will be heavy to heavy rainfall in parts of eastern southwest, southern Jianghuai, northwestern Jiangnan, southeastern Hubei and central Guangxi, including parts of northern Hunan and southwestern Jiangsu, and moderate to heavy rainfall in parts of central western North China, including parts of central Hebei.
The Ministry of Water Resources estimates that, as a result of the flooding, the inflow into the upper Three Gorges Reservoir of the Yangtze River could reach about 60,000 cubic meters per second by 28 days, the water level in the middle reaches of Lianhuatang River and Dongting Lake will rise again and exceed 0.20 meters, the water level in the middle reaches of Huai River will generally subside, and the water level in Hongze Lake will continue to subside, and rivers such as the Daqing River System and Yongding River will experience a process of rising water.
O'Keeping suggested that the Huai River basin should be further extensively drained, and that the water level of Lake Hongze should be reduced as soon as possible.
We should do well to cope with heavy rain and flooding in Yijiang and Sabi Rivers.
He said the Taihu basin should not relax and continue to increase the outflow of flood water, reduce the Taihu and surrounding river network water level as soon as possible, and reduce the risk of Taihu high water level and typhoon.
In addition, he emphasized that the floods in northern areas such as Inner Mongolia and Hebei Province are steeply rising and falling, the early warning time is short, it is very easy to cause landslides and mudslides in mountainous floods, and it is difficult to defend; the number of small and medium-sized reservoirs and silt dams is large, and there are safety dangers.
APPs infringing on users' rights and interests are exposed involving more than 10 listed companies-CNN
According to the Ministry of Industry and Communications, in accordance with the Law on Network Security, Regulations on Telecommunications, Provisions on the Protection of Personal Information of Telecommunications and Internet Users, and other laws and regulations, the third-party testing organizations have recently organized inspection of mobile phone application software and urged enterprises with problems to make corrections.
Some of the problems with these 58 apps include self-collection of personal information, excessive collection of personal information, frequent requests for permissions, excessive requests for permissions, difficulty in deleting accounts, self-sharing to third parties, denial of permissions and denial of use.
The Ministry of Industry and Communications requested that Section 58 of the APP should be completed by July 30 before the correction and implementation of the work, and if no correction is made within the time limit, the Ministry of Industry and Communications will organize the relevant disposal work according to the regulations.

For example, there are five problems with the private collection of personal information, over-the-counter collection of personal information, private sharing to third parties, forced users to use the forwarding function, and frequent application rights.
As of November 2019, the company is the "first real estate brokerage company in the country in the Internet SaaS (software serviced) model", providing online solutions for many brokerage firms, according to public information.
In response to the difficulty of deleting the "go-where-net" APP accounts pointed out in the notice, according to the Xinjing Daily, go-where-net responded that, in order to prevent the use of fraudulent registration and deletion to seek profits, go-where on the basis of the self-cancellation of the registration and the need to cancel the interval of one month.
Considering the convenience of cancellation and account security, the cancellation has been changed to immediate effect and is currently awaiting verification.
An unnamed cybersecurity expert told Xinhua's clients that the ministry has issued three such apps this year that violate users' rights and interests.
Among them, privately collecting personal information, over-request permission, account cancellation difficulty three problems repeatedly "manage" more than.
It can also be found from the notice that at present APP infringement of privacy is attracting more and more attention.
On 24 July, the Ministry of Industry and Communications issued a notice on the day of the 58 infringement of users' rights and interests APP, deploying special operations to deepen the infringement of users' rights and interests APP.
The special regulation will strengthen supervision and inspection in accordance with the regulations, urge relevant enterprises to strengthen the protection of personal information in APPs, eliminate violations of collection, use of users' personal information and harassment of users, deceiving and misleading users, implementation of application distribution platform management responsibilities, and purify the application space of APPs.
The Lewis Family: John Lewis was a warrior fighting for the weakest
John Lewis, a U.S. Congressman and civil rights activist, was remembered as a soldier "fighting for the weakest" at a memorial service for him on Saturday (July 25).
Lewis's public memorial service began on Saturday in Alabama.
There were two memorial services on the first day.
At a public memorial service at Troy University in Alabama on Saturday, Lewis's five brothers and sisters and a niece spoke of him as a loving, fearless, and family-oriented man.
Lewis' youngest brother, Henry "Grant" Lewis, said at the meeting: "He's dedicated his life to helping others.
Samuel Lewis said his mother had warned John, "Don't get in trouble, don't get in trouble.
He added that John did not listen to his mother's warning, saying, "We all know that John always gets into trouble, always gets into trouble, but it's because he insists on doing the right thing, it's a good trouble.
Lewis's brothers and sisters reminded people at the memorial that John's best-known argument was to create "good trouble," that is, to raise the issue for the sake of righteousness.
John had applied to Troy University in Troy, Alabama, where he was born, but Troy University, a white school at the time, refused to accept him.
John Lewis, who preached the gospel to chickens on his farm as a child, eventually earned a degree in religion and philosophy from Fisk University.
Many years later, the University of Troy awarded Lewis an honorary doctorate.
Congressman Doug Jones of Alabama said the current protesters were "peacefully, non-violently protesting," as Lewis had done in the Civil Rights Movement.
Jones said: "Even if President Trump overthrew a boatman with a rod and called all the protesters thugs, he was wrong.
The protesters are patriots who want the United States to move towards a more equal nation.
A six-day series of events in honor of Lewis will culminate this week at a funeral in Georgia.
Lewis's coffin was placed on display Saturday at a public memorial service at Troy University to pay tribute to the civil rights pioneer.
Later Saturday, a private ceremony honored him in a small church in Selma, Alabama, followed by an open memorial service.
On Sunday, Lewis' body will pass through Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma.
In 1965, he and demonstrators demanding black voting rights were severely beaten by Alabama police in front of the bridge, who also threw tear gas at the demonstrators.
Lewis was nearly killed.
The day was later known as Bloody Sunday.
Lewis' body will be transported to Montgomery, Alabama.
Mayor Steven Reed encouraged people to line up on the sidewalk and walk with Lewis on the final leg.
At the same time, officials demanded that the public wear masks and stay away from social activities.
Governor Kay Ivey ordered the flag to be lowered halfway to commemorate Lewis on Saturday and Sunday.
During the week-long memorial service, Lewis' remains will be temporarily displayed at the Alabama State Capitol in Montgomery, Georgia, the Georgia State Capitol in Atlanta, and the United States Capitol in Washington, D.C., for public mourning.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced last week that people could visit the Capitol on Monday and Tuesday to pay tribute to Lewis.
Due to the coronary virus outbreak, public events to mourn Lewis will be held outdoors.

Recently, during his visit to Jilin Province, the Chinese President stressed the need to strengthen the leadership of the Party, promote the extension of Party organization to the most grass-roots level, improve the working system of Party organization at the grass-roots level, and provide strong guarantees for the governance of urban and rural communities.
It is a fundamental requirement that the leadership of the Party should be carried out in all areas of grass-roots governance, and that the leadership of the Party should be guided by the establishment of the Party.
To raise the level of governance at the grass-roots level, we must insist on building the leadership of the Party, by strengthening political leadership, building battle fortresses, and consolidating the Red Force, and by promoting the transformation of the Party's political superiority, organizational superiority, and the superiority of the work of the masses into governance superiority, we must pass on the Party's strength and ideas to the "neural tip" and the "last kilometer".
Focus on rebuilding the soul of calcium and strengthening political leadership.
To strengthen the political leadership of grass-roots governance, it is necessary to implement the "calcium-filling casting soul" project well.
We should make it our first task to learn deeply and thoroughly about China's new economic and social development, make "not forgetting the original intention and keeping in mind the mission" an eternal task in the construction of the Party and a lifelong task for Party members and cadres, strengthen reading and learning the principles of the original text, promote the Party's innovation theory by continuously arming and strengthening its hearts and minds through thematic training, batch training, discussions and exchanges, holding lecture halls, and so on, and promote Party cadres to further strengthen the "four consciousnesses", firmly uphold the "four self-confidence," maintain the "two safeguards," and perform their duties and responsibilities better.
By combining online and offline learning methods, we can broaden the channels of learning and education and guide grass-roots Party organizations and Party cadres to truly integrate learning and education into their daily lives and grasp them regularly.
In the process of resolving the key difficulties in the field of grass-roots governance, we should focus on practical exercises to resolve the troubles and disturbances that the masses are concerned about, and to hammer out the Party's strength and ability.
Take up the standard upgrade and build a battle fortress.
The grass-roots party organization is not only an important part of the grass-roots governance system, but also an important carrier of the governance ability.
To promote the standardization of Party organization at the grass-roots level, we should start by grasping the rules and regulations governing the work of Party branches, focusing on the weakening and virtualization of the leadership of Party organizations, and establishing mechanisms for up-and-down linkages, innovative forms of branch formation, normalizing weaknesses and laxity, establishing and improving decision-making and discussion mechanisms, and mechanisms for serving the masses.
In rural areas, we should strengthen the standardization of Party organizations at the village level and, in line with the standardization construction standards of Party branches, standardize the organizational form, learning activities and management mechanisms, and effectively promote the implementation of the "three meetings, one lesson" and thematic Party Day activities.
In cities, focus on street communities, explore the form of setting up innovative branch offices, focus on weak areas, "blocking points" and "pain spots", actively build urban party-building alliances, so that the Party's work can be effectively covered.
At the same time, we have established and improved the system of governance at the grass-roots level, improved the decision-making and discussion mechanisms led by the Party organizations at the grass-roots level for discussing important matters, carrying out practical work together, deciding important matters jointly, negotiating urgent matters jointly, resolving difficult matters jointly, and improving the mechanism of contacting Party cadres to serve the masses.
To play a pioneering role and consolidate the red power.
Party cadres at the grass-roots level are the cornerstone of grass-roots governance.
To enhance grass-roots governance capacity, we will focus on improving the governance capacity of the Party cadres at the grass-roots level, emphasize the demonstration leadership role of the "red cells" in grass-roots governance, and consolidate the red power at the forefront of connecting and serving the masses.
We should make it a compulsory lesson for Party cadres at the grass-roots level to improve their governance ability, constantly strengthen their thought hardening, professional training and practical exercise, and develop the spirit of responsibility in their current posts and in critical and dangerous tasks, thus laying solid foundations and contributing to the modernization of the state governance system and governance capacity.
Communist Party members should play a role in community governance by participating in thematic Party Day activities, communicating with the hard-pressed masses, identifying service projects, acknowledging the smallest wishes, and making reasonable proposals, etc., and by participating in community construction, management and service.
We should give full play to the role of unemployed Party members in rural areas, and by setting up pioneer posts for unemployed Party members and forming unemployed Party members' task forces, we should guide the broad masses of grass-roots Party members to participate actively in various tasks such as fighting poverty, strengthening ecological construction, ensuring the stability of letters and visits, and banning the burning of straw, so as to better integrate the Red Force and serve the people.
The foundations of the building are solid.
The grassroots party organization is the foundation of the ruling building.
Only by insisting on a close relationship between the Party and its constituents, increasing the well-being of the people, and taking the leadership of the Party as a fundamental way of promoting the innovative development of grass-roots governance can we lay a firm foundation for the grass-roots Party organizations to be able to pull out and rise to the top, and for the Party cadres at the grass-roots level to be able to catch up and rush up, so as to promote grass-roots governance in a spirited, orderly, powerful and effective manner.

Xinhua News Agency (Xinning) reported by wire on July 25 (reporter Wang Jinjin) that the monitoring showed that Tibetan antelopes that had previously migrated to the Zhongnohu area of the Cocos Territory's hinterland were gradually ending their breeding and beginning to return to their original habitats with their young.
On 25 July, about 40 female Tibetan antelopes led by three young Tibetan antelopes passed 3002 km of the Qinghai-Tibet Highway and the Qinghai-Tibet Railway Five-Beam North Bridge.
Experts analyzed that in recent years, the number of young Tibetan antelopes in the return sheep herd accounted for one-quarter to one-fifth of the total number of Tibetan antelopes.
Lian Xinming, associate researcher at the Northwest Plateau Institute of Biology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said: "In the early stages of migration, Tibetan antelopes face a high risk of predation, so the number of pups in the flock will be relatively small, and there may even be no pups.
According to the National Park Service, the number of Tibetan antelope returns has been increasing year by year, and in 2019, the number of Tibetan antelope returns was 4,860, an increase of 338 from 2018.
"It is expected that the return of Tibetan antelopes this year will end at the beginning of September, and the number of returning Tibetan antelopes is still expected to increase," Lian said.
Tibetan antelope belongs to the national level of animal protection.
At the end of May every year, Tibetan antelopes from Qinghai's Three Rivers, Tibet's Qiangtang, and Xinjiang's Al Jinshan go to Lake Zhongno, which lies in the hinterland of Kokoxi.
"Tibetan antelope migration is the process of female antelopes returning to their homeland with their offspring after they have finished breeding," said Wu Xiaomin, an expert on the conservation of Tibetan antelopes and a researcher at the Shaanxi Provincial Zoological Institute (Northwest Endangered Animal Research Institute).
In order to ensure the safe relocation of the Tibetan antelope herd, reporters learned that the Coco Sili Administration Office of the Yangtze River Source Park of the Sanjiangyuan National Park Administration has arranged staff to carry out video surveillance and patrol in the main relocation area.
If a Tibetan antelope tries to cross the highway, the mountaineering team will conduct temporary traffic control at the earliest opportunity, so that the sheep can safely pass through the wildlife passageway, ensuring that they are as little as possible disturbed by humans on the way back.
So, how in everyday life should cool down the heat?
Experts recommend that you avoid high temperatures when you go out in the summer. It is best not to walk or work in the hot sun after mid-afternoon, because the sun is the strongest and the chances of heatstroke are higher.
If you have to go out at this time, be sure to do a good job of protection, such as shading the sun umbrella, wearing a sun hat, wearing sunglasses, the best condition is to apply sunscreen to protect against sunburn.
Wear light-colored, breathable cotton, linen and silk fabrics as much as possible, and wear fewer garments of synthetic fibers, so as not to be able to dissipate heat in time when sweating profusely, causing heat stroke.
Drink plenty of water in hot and humid weather. Do not wait until you are thirsty to drink, because if you feel thirsty, it means you are running out of water.
Depending on the temperature, the average person drinks 1.5 to 2 liters of water per day, while high-temperature workers drink 3 to 5 liters of water per day.
When sweating more, you can properly replenish some salt water to make up for the loss of salt in the body due to sweating.
In addition, in summer, the human body is easily deprived of potassium, making people feel tired and tired, potassium-containing tea is a great summer drink.
Eat plenty of watery fruits and vegetables in summer, such as raw vegetables, cucumbers, tomatoes, etc. Fresh fruits, such as peaches, apricots, cucumbers, melons, etc., with a water content of 80% to 90% can be used to replenish water; dairy products can both replenish water and satisfy the body's nutritional needs.
In addition, people working in high-temperature environments should be properly supplemented with drinks containing elements such as potassium and magnesium.
Summer days and nights are short, the temperature is high, the body metabolism is vigorous, the consumption is also large, easy to feel tired.
Sufficient sleep can relax both the brain and the body's systems, both for work and study, and as a measure to prevent heatstroke.
Experts say the best time to go to bed is between 22:00 and 23:00, and the best time to get up is between 5:30 and 6:30.
When sleeping, be careful not to lie under the air conditioner outlet and electric fan, so as not to suffer from air conditioning disease and thermal injury.
Experts suggest that people who are outdoors or engaged in high-temperature work should carry ten drops of heat-resistant medicines such as water, dandelion, herb-flavored water or herb-flavored pills with them, or place them close to the workplace and use them at all times to prevent heat strokes.

Among the few graduates who exhibited in person was Li Kei-ting from the Sculpture Department of Tianjin Academy of Fine Arts.
"I came to Beijing on July 7th, when I was a little worried about the epidemic, and I had a nitric acid test three days in advance, which was spread with alcohol cotton and the test report.
The structure of his work, Yesterday as a Riddle, is more complicated and must be done by hand.
At the same time, he undertook the task of helping students repair damaged works.
"The cloth was unfolded until 4:30 in the morning, and then repaired. It was very tight, and I forgot to take a picture with the work, and it was a bit of a pity.
He hopes that when the epidemic becomes more stable, he and his classmates will come to Beijing to see his art exhibition.

50,000 yuan awarded in Hubei Enshi praise sand dam landslide "early warning first person" - China News Agency
Hubei Daily News (journalist Lin Jing) On July 26, Enshi City announced that Chen Guangming, a geological disaster site monitor, had made an important contribution to the early warning of sand dam landslides and was awarded a 50,000 yuan prize.
At the same time, we call on the Party cadres of the whole city to learn from him the spirit of strict adherence to his duties, daring to take responsibility, taking the initiative, and being willing to give.
On 21 July, a landslide at the sand dam in Majiacun, Tuenburi Township, Onshi City, caused the Qingjiang River drainage to form a weir, and Chen Guangming, 58, was the first to warn of the landslide.
On the afternoon of 17 July, Chen Guangming learned of the cracking of the walls in the villagers' houses and immediately went to the scene to inspect them.
He had just come out of his house, five or six hundred meters away, when he saw the village road split four or five centimeters wide and stretched along the road to the corn fields, about 50 meters long.
Chen Guangmington was alarmed, the first time to send photos of the road bursting to the township "geological disaster monitors contact group".
After inspecting and judging the site by the relevant persons in charge of Tuen Mun Township Natural Planning, the possibility of landslides was great, and a decision was made to evacuate the people immediately.
Chen Guangming's timely warning gained 36 hours of valuable time for the safe evacuation of 315 households and 1,339 people in the affected area.
No one was injured or killed in this major geological disaster.
Chen Guangming's conscientious and responsible devotion to his profession has been praised by the masses.
Faced with the praise, he said, “There is no one to save, and it is my responsibility.”
New drug to treat angioedema caused by new coronary artery at University of Australia - Official website
Researchers at Monash University in Australia are developing a new drug that could help prevent heart disease and stroke and hope to treat blood clots caused by the new crown virus, Xinhua reported in Sydney on July 26.
The researchers found that an enzyme in the platelets accelerates platelet coagulation before a heart attack or stroke.
So they developed a drug that temporarily inhibits platelet aggregation, thereby avoiding blood vessel clogging and preventing heart disease and stroke.
The drug only suppresses platelet coagulation when heart disease or stroke signs appear, the researchers said.
Since studies have shown that similar blood clots are one of the main causes of death in patients with new coronary heart disease, the researchers hope the drug will be used in the future to treat such patients.
Now that the drug has been shown to work well in animal models, the researchers are preparing for the next phase of human clinical trials.
The results have been published in the journal Science and Transformative Medicine in the United States.
He became the first player to enter the CBA Tournament after allowing the audience to watch the game live.
On the same day, in Qingdao, Shandong, in the 2019-2020 season of the Chinese men's basketball professional league (CBA) replay second stage (Laoshan Playground), medical personnel, teachers, public security front personnel through the official ticketing platform, completed the relevant procedures including the nucleic acid test after entering the stadium to watch the Shanghai Jiuji Team against the East and West Wang Team match.
During the race, the spectators must wear a mask all the way to the pit stop, strictly keeping a distance of one meter.
When leaving the stage, the audience should keep the "one-meter line" social distance in an orderly sequence from the back to the front, the first two sides to the back and the middle.
Deep Cultivation of "Sunflower Field" in Xinjiang Using Clean Energy - China New Internet
Author: Chen Haifeng Editor-in-Chief: Chen Haifeng
Xinjiang's deep-cultivated sunflower fields use clean energy, Xinjiang News Agency, July 26, 2007 (Xinjiang News Agency)
More than 6,000 five-sided sundials, each 48 square meters in size, are arranged neatly in a circle, like a silver sunflower field, which rotates with the sun, reflecting the sunlight to a central heat-absorbing tower more than 200 meters high, generating electricity.
The reporter saw the scene at the Central Power Engineering Hami molten salt tower-type photothermal power plant in the town of Mu Maohu in Igo County, Hami City, Xinjiang.
"The so-called molten salt tower photo-thermal power generation is the reflection of sunlight through the mirror surface to the heat-absorbing tower to form thermal energy, and then through traditional power generation technology to convert thermal energy into electricity.
Zhang Yong, deputy general manager of CPC Hami Solar Thermal Power Co., Ltd., said the design principle is similar to the solar cooker used in rural areas of northwest China, all the sunlight will be gathered.
Construction of the power plant began in October 2017, and the network was completed by the end of last year, covering an area of 6,600 acres, with a total of 14,500 sets of sundials planned to be installed.
"Compared to conventional solar power generation, its greatest advantage is that it can store the accumulated heat and generate electricity at night.
Mr. Zhang said the 13-hour heat storage system provided by the project would allow the generators to operate continuously and stably, without being affected by changes in light, and to participate rapidly in the peak adjustment of the grid according to the peak load valley requirements.
After completion, the project will generate 198 million degrees of electricity annually, save more than 60,000 tons of standard coal per year, reduce emissions of more than 60 tons of sulphur dioxide, more than 60 tons of nitrogen oxides, about 20 tons of smoke and dust, and more than 1.5 million tons of carbon dioxide, providing local clean energy sources.
In addition, there is another silver "Sunflower Field" in the Ishinomaki Photovoltaic Industrial Park in Hami City.
Over 2,300 acres of Hampshire Light's solar photovoltaic power plant, 714 generating units have been built that also follow the sun's rotation, always keeping the sun's rays at 90 degrees perpendicular to the surface of the photovoltaic panel.
"We use double-axis tracking photovoltaic power generation technology. Through integrated control, all power generation equipment can be adjusted to the angle of the sun's altitude to maintain power generation efficiency.
The power generation technology can increase the efficiency of photovoltaic generation by about 20 percent compared to conventional photovoltaics in sunny weather conditions, said Meng Qi, the station's director.
In the first half of this year, the power station has generated more than 7 million degrees of electricity, replenishing local demand for electricity.
At present, Shichengzi Photovoltaic Industrial Park is Xinjiang's largest single-unit, the most complete photovoltaic component type of a photovoltaic industry demonstration park, a total of 38 residential photovoltaic power generation projects, a total installed capacity of 820,000 kilowatts.
Electricity generated in the first half of this year exceeded 110 million degrees, an increase of 6% compared to the same period in 2019.
Hami is one of the best areas in China for solar energy.
The average annual total solar radiation is more than 6,200 megajoules per square metre, with around 3,200 hours of sunshine per year.
In recent years, the city has vigorously developed the photovoltaic industry and planted "Sunflower Fields".
Solar power generation of more than 2.5 million kilowatts has been installed, and the city's photovoltaic generation exceeded 1.4 billion degrees in the first half of this year, up about 14% year-on-year.
At present, there are more than 330 photovoltaic power plants in Xinjiang, with an installed capacity of more than 10 million kilowatts.
Photovoltaic generation is expected to reach 15 billion degrees this year, replacing more than 6 million tons of standard coal.
Police report details of "women university students travelling to Qinghai lost connections" Search and rescue work continues - Xinhua News Agency
Xinhua News Agency, Xining, July 26, by wire (journalist Wang Jinjing Zhou Zheng) Recently, "a female university student traveled to Qinghai Gulmo after the disconnection" caused netizens concern.
The Guermo Public Security Bureau of Haixi Mongolian-Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in Qinghai Province reported on Sunday that Huang Zhi, a student at a university in Nanjing, is still in a disconnected state.
On July 10, 2020, the security branch of the Guermo Public Security Bureau of Hexi Province received a notification from a superior that a student of a Nanjing University, Mr. Huang, was traveling on a Z164 train from Nanjing to Guermo on July 5, and on July 9, the officer's aircraft in the southwestern area of the Shimizu River at Sonan Dajie Protection Station in Qumale County, Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Qinghai Province, was lost and requested assistance in locating it.
According to the investigation of the Guermo Public Security Bureau, Mr. Huang entered Qinghai at 19:54 on July 6, and arrived in Guermo at 4:00 on July 7.
At 8 a.m. on the same day, Mr. Huang left the Yellow River Hotel in Gorm City by taxi on the G109 National Highway and arrived at the Sonandajie Protection Station in Cocos City at 12 a.m., the taxi driver returned alone, and Mr. Huang arrived at the Shimizu River area near the Sonandajie Protection Station at 3 p.m. on the 7th and left the area at 6 p.m. on the 9th.
In further investigation, the police found that Mr. Huang passed through the Nogigou checkpoint at 17:07 on July 13.
Since the checkpoint does not have video surveillance, it is not possible to ascertain the information about me and the vehicles I am driving, the police can only drive along the way to conduct searches, coordinate the checkpoints along the way in Tibet, and if they find Mr. Huang, immediately get in touch with the Guermo Public Security Bureau.
According to the latest information, at 1 a.m. on July 26, the Guermo Public Security Bureau organized the rescue force to carry rescue equipment and go to the Unfrozen Spring Protection Station and Sonan Dajie Protection Station along the Qinghai-Tibet Highway for search and rescue.

At the same time, the relevant experts warned that tourists should be standardized, rational and civilized when outdoor activities, pay attention to the roadside warning signs at all times, do not venture into uninhabited areas, and in the event of an emergency, call the police in a timely manner.
US media unveils the truth of America's unjustified demand for China's closure of the consulate-general in Houston-Chinanews.net
| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |
Media outlets reveal the truth about the U.S.'s unjustified demand that China shut down its consulate in Houston
On 24 April, the Chinese Foreign Ministry informed the U.S. Embassy in China that China had decided to revoke the permit for the establishment and operation of the U.S. Consulate General in Chengdu, and made specific requests to the Consulate General to cease all operations and activities, as a countermeasure to the U.S. abruptly requested China to close the Consulate General in Houston on 21 April.
The U.S. government's actions have sparked widespread concern, and its political motives have been questioned by outsiders and academics.
Why is China demanding the closure of the Consulate General?
Several foreign media outlets said it was unclear why the U.S. would choose China's consulate-general in Houston, but spoke bluntly about the purpose of the move: for the election.
CNN reported on July 23 that the U.S. move to ask China to close its consulate-general in Houston raised questions about its political motives.
According to the article, the US government's disastrous response to the new crown disease caused a relatively low turnout in the pre-election polls for President Donald Trump.
White House officials privately claim that China’s tough strategy is aimed at saving Trump’s approval ratings, as well as shifting the blame for the White House’s failure for the outbreak.
The article argued that China's consulate-general in Houston was a "politically driven, very cautious" target chosen by the U.S. government "in order to create a tough attitude while avoiding the risk of a major conflict".
The BBC also believed that Trump had a “political advantage in playing the Chinese card” as the US election season approached and the US economy was hit hard by the epidemic.
The current state of affairs is “a spiralling, confrontational struggle,” driven in part by the US government’s domestic considerations, which will only exacerbate tensions between the two countries.
CBS reported that Trump’s prospects for re-election were undermined by the outbreak, which he repeatedly blamed on China.
Almost every day, the US takes new action against Trump’s so-called “China’s exploitation of America” rhetoric.
"The Consulate-General of Houston is very important in establishing ties between the two countries"
The Associated Press commented that the U.S. demand that China shut down its consulate in Houston has exacerbated tensions between the world's two largest economies.
With the closure of the Chinese Consulate-General in Houston, in addition to diplomatic repercussions, Chinese citizens in the southern United States faced difficulties in obtaining consular services, as did American citizens seeking visas and other services.
A business group in Houston has expressed regret over US demands that China shut down its consulate in Houston, saying the consulate has played an important role in establishing trade, investment and cultural ties between the two countries.
The Associated Press believes this reflects the importance of China's economy.
According to the website of the US magazine Foreign Policy, the U.S. move "is part of a series of provocative moves that will only worsen U.S.-China relations".
Jonathan Pollack, an expert on East Asia at the American think tank The Brookings Institution, quoted Reuters as saying that since the establishment of full diplomatic relations between the United States and China in 1979, he could not think of any move that could be equated with the U.S. action against China's consulate in Houston.
The South China Morning Post reported that the move was unprecedented in the more than 40 years of diplomatic relations between the two countries.
Analysts believe the move could cause lasting damage.
The Chinese Consulate-General in Houston was established in 1979 and was the first Chinese Consulate-General to open in the United States.
Currently, China has one embassy and five consulates-general in the United States.
"Russian Navy celebrates Navy Day".
On 26 July, in Saint Petersburg, Russia, a flotilla participated in the Navy Day celebrations.
Xinhua News Agency (Mochina)
Moscow, July 26 (Xinhua News Agency) - Russian fleets held a parade on July 26 to celebrate the Navy Day, marking the 324th anniversary of the founding of the Russian Navy.
On the same day, the Russian North Sea, Baltic Sea, Black Sea, Caspian Sea and Pacific Fleets held parades in the waters of their respective bases, with a total of 15,000 troops, 219 ships of various types and 71 military aircraft participating.
Russian President Vladimir Putin, commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces, attended the parade of the Baltic Fleet.
Approximately 4,000 soldiers, 46 ships and more than 40 warplanes participated in the parade.
Putin first inspected the flotilla in the waters of the Baltic naval base at Kronstadt.
Subsequently, he arrived in the waters of the Neva River in the centre of Saint Petersburg in a speedboat and went ashore to watch a parade on the Neva River.
Speaking at the parade, Putin said the modernization of the Russian Navy's equipment has been steadily improving in recent years, and the Navy will receive a total of about 40 new ships equipped with a unique high-speed supersonic strike system by 2020.
In addition, the commander-in-chief of the Russian Navy Yevgeny Menov said in an interview with the Russian Defense Ministry's Red Star newspaper that the plan to build Russian ships has been effectively implemented, and the number of new ships the Russian Navy plans to receive in 2020 is larger in recent years.
In 1696, Tsar Peter the Great set about forming a naval fleet, beginning the history of the Russian Navy.
The last Sunday of July is the Russian Navy Day.
In response to the new changes in epidemic prevention and control, since July 17, trade unions at all levels in Xinjiang have responded to the call of the Autonomous Region's General Trade Union and actively participated in epidemic prevention and control.
North and South Tianshan trade union cadres, workers and labor models went into the street community and the residents, carried out activities such as delivering vegetables, medicines, disinfection and sterilization, publicizing the knowledge of epidemic prevention, serving the workers and the people, and demonstrating the "hard core strength" of the trade union with practical actions.
Recently, a group of the General Union of the Tianshan District of Urumqi City sent a batch of urgently needed epidemic prevention and control supplies to the workers of 12 quarantine stations.
After the outbreak, the Tianshan District allocated more than $1.05 million in emergency funds to 23 directly affiliated grassroots trade unions.
Zhao Xiangguo, deputy secretary of the party committee and chairman of the trade union of the Xinjiang Construction Workers' Party and the Xinjiang Construction Workers' Party, after receiving the notice of the company on the prevention and control of epidemics, took the initiative to ask Yi, and chose to remain on duty in the units, and sail safely for the workers.
He delivers cooking utensils, food and daily necessities to the flatmates and newly employed workers, and organizes supplies for their daily living every two days.
"Starting from July 21, the cadres and workers on the front line who are firmly committed to the war 'epidemic' will be examined, and orders will be placed online and goods will be delivered to the doors of merchants, and the 704 workers and workers on the front line in the Urumqi region will be the first to supplement their purchases of anti-epidemic supplies and livelihood materials."
The head of Xinjiang Transportation Trade Union told reporters that in the face of a sudden epidemic, they are doing their utmost to ensure epidemic prevention and control services, steadily push forward all kinds of transportation development activities, and create a strong atmosphere of a concerted fight against the "epidemic."
At this time of high summer temperatures, trade unions at all levels are focusing on the front line workers in key areas to prevent and control the epidemic.
On 19 July, the Urumqi County General Union launched a "cooling off" campaign to the first-line workers in the prevention and control of the epidemic, and the entire county police station, card points and sanitation system received beverages, fruit, and other relief items.
"Trade union cadres need to further improve their political standing, strengthen their accountability, warm their hearts with concern, and inspire their spirits with action.
We must give full play to the role of trade unions in organizing and uniting workers, ensuring the protection of epidemic prevention and control services, actively safeguarding the health rights and interests of the vast majority of workers, and bringing care to the front-line workers."
The head of the autonomous region's trade unions said.

Chinese Government is a Firm Safeguarder of Cyber Security - China New Net, Embassy Spokesman
A spokesman for the Chinese embassy in the United Kingdom responded to a reporter's question about the mistaken statements about cyber attacks on July 25, according to the website of the Chinese embassy in the United Kingdom.
The spokesman emphasized that the Chinese government is a staunch defender of cyber security and has always resolutely opposed and fought against any form of cyber attacks and cyber crime.
According to media reports, Chinese-related hacking organizations have disrupted a British company's network system, launched attacks on U.S. and U.K. technology companies that hold patent data, and invaded the networks of EU governments.
The spokesman said the Chinese government is a staunch defender of cyber security and has consistently strongly opposed and fought against any form of cyber attacks and cyber crime.
The virtuality of network space is strong, traceability is difficult, and behaviors are diverse. When investigating and characterizing network events, sufficient evidence should be presented, and no endless speculation should be made.
The spokesman said a series of incidents in the past, such as the "prism door," have shown that the United States has been engaged in the world's largest network theft operations.
It is in the common interest of all countries to maintain peace and stability in cyberspace.
The spokesman pointed out that China's achievements in technological innovation had not been stolen or snatched, but had been achieved through self-reliance and hard work.
In 2019, China submitted about 59,000 patent applications through the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT), with an annual growth rate of 10.6%, becoming the country with the highest number of international patent applications.
China has become an innovation and intellectual property powerhouse.
According to the People's Bank of China's Urumqi Central Branch, in the first half of the year, Xinjiang's new loans to farmers and small- and medium-sized enterprises all exceeded the year-on-year increase in 2019.
In the first half of this year, the People's Bank of China's Urumqi Central Branch used a variety of monetary policy instruments to guide the banking industry in stepping up lending and providing adequate financial guarantees for the prevention and control of epidemics and the resumption of industrial reconstruction.
Urumqi Free Nucleic Acid Testing in Most Areas Has Been Completed Secondary Testing in High Risk Areas - Xinhua News Agency
Zhang Wei, director of the city's health and safety committee, said on July 26 that most of the city's free nucleic acid testing has been basically completed.
The expert group of the State Council and the experts of the autonomous region and the city of Urumqi are making a further assessment of the development of the epidemic on the basis of the results of nucleic acid testing and epidemiological investigation.
The Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region Information Office held a press conference on 26th to report on the epidemic situation and prevention and control in Xinjiang.
According to him, 22 new confirmed cases of new coronary pneumonia (of which 5 were confirmed as asymptomatic) and 38 asymptomatic cases were reported in Urumqi from 0:00 to 24:00 on July 25.
As at 2400 hours on 25 July, there were 135 confirmed cases and 147 asymptomatic cases in Urumqi.
Additional asymptomatic infections on the 25th were also essentially screened through the city's free nucleic acid testing and proactive screening.
Zhang Wei, director of the city's health and safety committee, said on Sunday that most of the city's free nucleic acid testing has been basically completed.
He added that from the experience of other parts of the country, there are many factors that influence the results of nucleic acid testing, such as the sensitivity of the test reagents, the time of infection and detoxification of the test subjects, the co-ordination of the test subjects when samples are collected (the lack of co-ordination may result in the samples not being collected in place), the testing environment and the proficiency of the test subjects.
For various reasons, nucleic acid testing also produces false negative results.
The so-called false negative means that the tested person is indeed infected, but the nucleic acid test results are negative.
In addition, for persons who have had close contact with confirmed cases and suspected cases, it usually takes two nucleic acid tests to exclude.
For people who have been to high-risk areas of the epidemic, if fever and respiratory symptoms occur, a negative nucleic acid test may be false negative, so it also takes two nucleic acid tests to rule out.
In view of the above, he said, for the sake of the health of the people of all ethnic groups in the city, from today, the city of Urumqi will conduct free secondary nucleic acid testing in key areas such as Tianshan District, Shai Baq District, and will also carry out "checking for residual leaks".
It is reported that Tianshan and Shaibak areas are high-risk areas for the epidemic.

Shanghai International Film Festival Showcases Uncommon Industry Confidence
Yesterday, the 23rd Shanghai International Film and Television Festival, held against the backdrop of stringent anti-epidemic measures, opened with an industry summit forum on the theme of "going all out for a healthy life and building a new era of dreams".
This year's Shanghai International Film Festival is of great significance as the first international film and television festival organized since the spread of the global epidemic and the normalization of epidemic prevention and control in China.
The Shanghai International Film and Television Festival is both an expression of confidence and a declaration of determination that, on the basis of the normalization of epidemic prevention and control, we are determined to overcome the epidemic, hold people’s festivals, build a global film and television production center, and launch the “Shanghai Culture” brand.
Each year, the Shanghai International Film Festival, with its constant innovation and aggressive attitude, is a new beginning and a new beginning.
Therefore, it is necessary to take every step to satisfy the people's spiritual life and service the development of the film and television industry.
This year is even more so.
In order to cherish the difficult epidemic prevention and control situation, the Shanghai International Film Festival, on the one hand, strictly adheres to the epidemic prevention and control requirements, implements the epidemic prevention and control measures in detail; on the other hand, with the vision of gathering wisdom for Chinese film creation, satisfying the demand of movie fans, opens online and offline multi-platform activities.
On the first day of the festival, from online screenings to industry forums, the festival's related activities strictly implement related anti-epidemic policies.
The forums are controlled by no more than 50 people, and the number of seats and the attendance rate are strictly controlled by no more than 30%.
As the Film Festival Organizing Committee maintains, in any case, "putting the people's life safety and health first" are the main prerequisites.
There is a lot of activity downstream, and the "cloud" is much more lively.
In order to implement the important idea of "People's City for People, People's City for People," and as a festival for the people, this year's Shanghai International Film Festival plans to innovate and seek transformation, using online "cloud exhibition" and master class "cloud sharing" initiatives to meet the diverse needs of film fans.
On the opening day, the festival’s official partners, Miko Video and Oriental Pearl百视通, presented several “Broad Belt and Road” films, “Up the Cloud,” respectively, to fans.
On that evening, the Jinzhao Opening Forum and the Jia Zhang Ke Master Class were also launched on platforms such as Zhong Video, Learn Stronger Country, and Wenhui App, allowing people to watch the latest trends in Chinese cinema from home.
At the opening forum yesterday, Yan Xiaoming, a member of the Central Radio and Television Broadcasting Corporation's party group and deputy director, delivered a speech announcing the opening of the festival. Minister Zhou Huilin, member of the Standing Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Communist Party and Minister of Publicity, and Deputy Mayor Zong Ming attended.
White House Epidemic Expert: Cautionary Optimism for Vaccine Development in Early 2021
Mr Foggy made the statement at an online videoconference hosted by the International Leadership Foundation on May 25.
It is not yet clear how the outbreak will develop in the autumn and winter, nor what the final impact of the outbreak will be, he reminded. "The only way to end it is for each of us to choose to be part of the solution.
According to data from Johns Hopkins University, 417,600 newly diagnosed cases and 146,000 deaths were reported in the United States by 2100 hours on May 25.
Mr Fogg said some parts of the U.S. are struggling to cope with the rebounding epidemic.
Although epidemics vary across regions and require tailor-made responses, a diversified strategy does not mean that there are no close links between regions.
The epidemic in one area will eventually affect other areas.
"This is not a time for complacency," he said. "Our work is not finished, we must intensify our efforts, and we must be vigilant about the uncertainties of the future.
At the meeting, Ho Dai-ichi, a Chinese-American medical expert and founder of the cocktail cure for AIDS, said the new crown epidemic in the United States had not yet reached its peak.
Every one of us must do our part to slow down the spread of the virus.
Mr Ho called for the public to use its practical actions to buy time for scientists to accelerate the development of new crown-treatment drugs and vaccines.
The International Leadership Foundation (ILF) is a non-profit organization dedicated to promoting international exchange in the United States and the Asia-Pacific region.
On the same day, U.S. Transportation Secretary Zhao Xiaolan, U.S. Representative Meng Zhaowen and International Leaders Foundation founding president Dong Jiling spoke at the meeting.
They paid special tribute to Asian-American health workers and volunteers on the front line, and called on the American public to continue to adhere to anti-epidemic norms such as "social distance" to curb the spread of the disease.

Brazilian study shows that hydrochlorobenzene is ineffective in the treatment of mild-to-moderate pneumonia - CNS
Recently, a Brazilian study has shown that hydrochlorobenzene is ineffective in patients with mild to moderate pneumonia.
The study was published in the New England Journal of Medicine.
The researchers divided 667 patients from 55 hospitals across the country into three groups and conducted clinical trials comparing the efficacy of hydrochlorobenzene alone or in combination with other antibiotics, azithromycin, to see if it could improve the condition of mild and moderate patients with new coronary pneumonia.

U.S.-China Trade Representative Meets in August
The head of China's trade negotiating team, Vice Premier Liu He, and the joint leader of the US team, trade representative Lai Haizhe, are expected to hold formal talks in August to assess the implementation of the first-stage trade agreement between the two countries, the South China Morning Post quoted an anonymous person familiar with the matter as saying on Sunday.
Although China has increased its purchases of U.S. agricultural products substantially in the past few months, it still has a long way to go from what it pledged in the trade agreement, the report said, citing factors such as the outbreak of the new crop virus.
Analysts say the recent US-China closure of each other's consulates, coupled with other disputes, could undermine any progress on trade.
The first-stage trade agreement between China and the United States comes into effect one month after its signing on January 15. The agreement stipulates that a high-level trade framework group of the two sides should meet every six months.
The meeting will be "an important turning point" for both sides to assess the progress of the agreement, people familiar with the matter said.
But the man also said that if tensions between the U.S. and China led to a lack of willingness at the time, the two sides might agree to a May 8 telephone meeting between Mr. Lai and Mr. Liu, which meets the terms of the trade agreement's six-monthly meeting.
Since this year, Sino-US relations have deteriorated rapidly, with disputes over the origin of the new crown virus, trade, Hong Kong, Xinjiang, the South China Sea, and ideology among other issues.
US President Donald Trump, who boasted earlier this year of what he had achieved in the first phase of the deal, has recently changed his mind.
He told reporters at the White House on the 23rd that although China has recently purchased a record amount of corn from the United States on a daily basis and a lot of soybeans, <unk>he trade deal is not as important to me as it was when it was made<unk>?
An anonymous Beijing government adviser also believes that a new round of trade talks is unlikely to take place because of poor US-China relations.
But he revealed that China’s economic and trade partners were still meeting on the 23rd to discuss a range of issues, including how to increase imports from the US. “We’ve done our best to buy, so any additional purchases will be difficult.”
<unk>淚t is more important than ever to keep the first-stage agreement alive,<unk>?said Peng Jiening, vice-chairman of the U.S.-China National Trade Commission, and noted that China has made progress this year in further opening up financial markets to U.S. firms.
"It's better to talk than not to talk, although it might just be routine," said analyst Plenum, an independent research firm.
Xinhua news agency reported by wire on July 26 (reporter Wei Yukun) from the Ministry of Emergency Management that the Ministry of Defense and Emergency Management will once again urgently dispatch 1.35 million knitted bags, 1.2 million knitted cloths and 1.3 million earthwork cloths from the State Food and Material Reserve Bureau to Anhui province to support the relief efforts of the province.

NASDAQ China Chief Representative Yusheng Hao: Now is the Best Time for Chinese Companies to IPO in the U.S.-Economic Watch-Specialized Financial News Website
Due to the counterfeiting incident, the U.S. market has imposed more stringent regulation on Chinese short-selling stocks, along with long-term valuation pressure, and the pressure on Chinese short-selling stocks listed in the U.S., Netease, jingjing and other Chinese short-selling stocks have recently begun to seek listing back in Hong Kong.
And recently shell, ideal car and other companies, the enthusiasm for listing in the United States rose.
Is now the best time for Chinese companies to go public in the U.S. amid the epidemic and the Chinese stock market crisis?
"As far as the recent IPOs and the companies that are going to be listed in the U.S. are concerned, the IPOs in the U.S. have essentially been unaffected. Instead, the market is very good, and even now is the best time for Chinese companies to go to the U.S. for IPOs in the past decade.
Hao Yusheng, chief representative of Nasdaq's China region, said at the "2020 Leaders of Listed Companies Summit," hosted by Snowball.
In April, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Public Company Accounting Regulatory Commission (PCAOB) issued a Statement on the Importance of Audit Quality and Regulatory Access to Audit and Other International Information – A Discussion of Current Information Access Challenges for US Listed Companies with Extensive Operations in China.
The statement said that, despite significant increases in international cooperation and coordination in recent years, U.S. regulators still face legal and practical challenges in accessing information, and that the SEC and PCAOB faced legal and practical challenges.
Moreover, in May, the Senate passed the Foreign Companies Accountability Act, requiring additional disclosure of information about foreign companies listed in the United States.
According to Hao Yu-sheng, the crisis of short-selling stocks has not affected the appetite of investors.
<unk>淚t scared everybody when it came out, and everyone was asking about the future of not being able to go public in the U.S., but then we found out that these questions weren't on the investor side, that investors might ask about them on their recent tour of the U.S. IPO, and that they might even become standardized questions, but that's not what investors see as an important factor in investing in or not investing in a Chinese company.<unk>?
I suggest that we look at the current situation as normally as possible.
Of course, this may seem like the worst case in two years, but it hasn't affected investor appetite.
So the IPO boom will continue from now until the end of this year or before the U.S. elections.
On May 9, Jinshan Yun was officially listed on Nasdaq in the U.S., becoming the first Chinese company to go to the U.S. for an IPO after the outbreak.
"The listing of Jinshan Yun gives a lot of confidence to the Chinese companies that are preparing for IPOs.
Hao Yusheng said.
In the first half of this year, a total of 20 Chinese companies went to the US for IPOs, up 17.6% from the same period last year, according to a report released by Snowball on China’s mid-term stock market prospects for the first half of 2020; the total amount of initial capital raised by the 20 companies totaled $27.25 billion, up 52.4% from the same period last year; and, in terms of the distribution of industries, the number of IPOs in the health-care sector was outstanding in the first half of this year, up 100% from the same period last year.
According to Mr. Hao, Chinese companies that go to the US for IPOs in the first half of this year are of high quality, and those that have a solid foundation and high-quality growth will be more attractive to investors.
In the short, medium and long term, Mr. Hao remains optimistic about the Ming Chinese company's IPO in the U.S.
"In the short term, the IPO boom in the U.S. will continue; in the medium term, Chinese companies will have more options, A-shares, Hong Kong stocks, U.S. stocks, and everyone will consider the U.S. election and the relationship between China and the U.S. as factors of market choice and timing; in the long term, everything will return to normal, market fluctuations will be cyclical, both political cycles and economic cycles, and eventually will return to normal, the stock market has always been volatile.
"There are a lot of uncertainties this year, but for high-quality companies, whether the market is good or bad, as long as they are solid and have the growth that investors can see, the other factors are relatively minor, and investors need to invest in good Chinese companies," Mr. Hao said.

People's Daily Commentator: Focusing on Our Own Businesses Building New Advantages for Future Development - On Learning and Implementing the Key Points of the President-in-Office at the Entrepreneurs' Symposium
Xinhua, July 25, 2007 People's Daily, July 26, 2007 Focus on your own business and build new advantages for future development
At present, the global epidemic situation and the world economic situation are still severe and complicated, and the challenges facing China's development are unprecedented.
Maintaining our strategic strength, strengthening our confidence in winning, and concentrating on doing our own thing are the keys to meeting all kinds of risk challenges.
At the recent entrepreneurs' symposium, the Chinese President stressed that in the current external environment of rising protectionism, sluggish world economy and shrinking global markets, we must concentrate our efforts to do our own thing, give full play to the advantages of the ultra-large domestic market, gradually form a new development pattern with the domestic large-scale circulation as the main body and the domestic and international dual circulation mutually promoted, upgrade the level of modernization of industrial chain supply chains, vigorously promote scientific and technological innovation, accelerate the key core technology offensive, and build new advantages for future development.
The seeker wins, the steer wins.
In the external environment of the deep development of economic globalization, markets and resources play an important role in China's rapid development.
Now, the world is undergoing profound changes under the impact of the epidemic, facing more instability and uncertainty, and economic globalization is facing headwinds and reversals.
One of the most important aspects of preparing for and working on the changes in the external environment for a longer period of time and pushing China's economy to break through the winds and make steady progress is to expand and satisfy domestic demand as a strategic base for development, to give full play to its own advantages, and to add impetus to China's economic development through the prosperity of its domestic economy and the smooth passage of the domestic cycle, thereby promoting the recovery of the world economy.
We should deeply realize that building a complete system of domestic demand is related to our country's long-term development and long-term security.
The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) has clearly stated that it is necessary to resolutely implement the strategy of expanding domestic demand in order to cope with the impact of the epidemic, to maintain the long-term and sustainable healthy development of China's economy, and to satisfy the people's growing need for a better life.
The advantage of a large economy is that it is internally recyclable.
China has the most complete and largest industrial system in the world, a strong productive capacity, a perfect supporting capacity, more than 100 million market entities, more than 170 million people with higher education or various professional skills, and an ultra-large domestic demand market of 1.4 billion people, including more than 400 million middle-income groups.
Socialist basic economic systems, such as the socialist market economy system, can not only stimulate the vitality of all kinds of market entities, liberate and develop social productivity, but also promote efficiency and equitable organic unification and continuously achieve common prosperity.
We should firmly grasp the strategic basis of expanding domestic demand, make the production, distribution and circulation of all the links more reliant on the domestic market to achieve a virtuous cycle, clarify the strategic direction of supply-side structural reform, and promote a dynamic balance between aggregate supply and aggregate demand at a higher level.
We must accelerate the construction of a complete system of domestic demand, vigorously promote scientific and technological innovation and other innovations in all aspects, accelerate the advancement of strategic emerging industries such as the digital economy, intelligent manufacturing, life and health, and new materials, and form more new growth points and growth poles.
Openness brings progress, but closedness inevitably lags behind.
President Xi Jinping has repeatedly emphasized that China's open door will not be closed, only the more open the bigger.
Taking the Great Domestic Cycle as the main subject, we should not close our doors and shut down our operations, but achieve stronger and more sustainable development by exploiting the potential of domestic demand, better connecting domestic and international markets, and making better use of both domestic and international markets and resources.
At the same time, the expansion of domestic demand and the expansion of openness are not contradictory.The smoother the domestic cycle, the more favorable it is to construct a new pattern of openness, and the more favorable it is to form new advantages in participating in international cooperation and competition.
Although protectionism is on the rise internationally, we should stand on the right side of history, insist on deepening reform, expanding openness, strengthening open cooperation in the field of science and technology, promoting the construction of an open world economy, and promoting the construction of a community of human destiny.
The Chinese nation has experienced many hardships in its history, but has never been crushed. Instead, the more it is crushed, the braver it becomes.
On the way forward, with the strong leadership of the Central Committee of the Party with Comrade Xi Jinping as its core, with the remarkable advantages of the socialism with Chinese characteristics system, with the strong mobilization capability and comprehensive strength, and with the unity and struggle of the entire Party and the entire army of the people of all ethnic groups, we will surely be able to overcome all difficulties and obstacles, maintain our country's good economic and social development momentum, achieve economic and social development and smoothly start the new quest of building a socialist modernized country in an all-round manner!
The balance of the treasure proceeds after the "90" instead of the "retaliation" deposit money?
With the proceeds of the surplus falling, not only did “90’s” not escape the surplus, but began to “retaliate” to save money?
In the first half of the year, after 90, people are saving more: the amount of money saved per capita has grown by nearly 40% since 2019, according to the China New Economic Research Institute's Balanced Savings Report after 90 (2020 edition).
Interestingly enough, people in their late 90s are more likely to start saving small amounts of money, with 60% averaging less than $20 per saved
It has also become a habit to save money after 90.
Of the more than 700 million subscribers, 134 million are “after 90,” according to the data.
In China, there are 174 million “90 afters,” which means that about three out of every four “90 afters” in the country are saving with surpluses.
Currently, the 7-day annualized yields of money funds such as Yue Bao have fallen to about 1.5 per cent from above 2 per cent at the beginning of the year.
Even so, it does not affect the pace of saving after the 1990s.
In the background of the rise of the "saving effect" of the balance, many young people who are accustomed to using the balance are also directly converted into "basic citizens".
As of July 13, more than a doubling of the year-on-year growth in the number of new "basic citizens" on pay-as-you-go has taken place in the past month, and more and more young people are pursuing "advanced" financial management on pay-as-you-go, according to pay-as-you-go data.
Some analysts argue that the flow of funds from the surplus into the stock market was also a significant factor in the clear decline in the money funds' share in June.
The report also found that girls were more likely than boys to save more after 90, averaging 20 per cent more than boys; 60 per cent of users of the pay-as-you-go platform who held funds were men, and women were more likely than men to choose a more secure form of finance.
After saving money, what is the plan after 90?
According to PayPal data, the '90s have a habit of saving money for a purpose, with travel being the most popular savings goal.
As a result of the outbreak, many "after 90s" saved money to prepare for post-epidemic travel; movie theaters resumed operations and provided a new way to move from saving to consumption.

France will add hundreds of millions of euros to its space defense budget to develop a military force in space to guard against “unfriendly actions” by other countries in outer space, French Defence Minister François Pali said on Thursday.
Parry told the Provence newspaper on the same day that the budget for France's military space program would increase from €3.6 billion ($4.2 billion) to €4.3 billion ($5.0 billion) between 2019 and 2025.
Under the French Military Planning Act 2019–2025, approved by the French Parliament in 2018, France is expected to upgrade its existing observation and communications satellites, launch three electromagnetic reconnaissance satellites, and upgrade its space surveillance radar.
French President Emmanuel Macron announced last July that the French Air Force would establish a Space Military Command and an Air and Space Force.
Parry said she would officially announce the creation of the space force when she visited a military school in Saron, in the Provence region, later that day.
Parry says the space force is part of the Air Force and will have 500 personnel by 2025.
"Space was once thought to serve the common interests of science, and it is no longer the case," she said. "Now it is a place where nations compete for global hegemony.
Parry reiterated Macron's earlier statement that the French had no intention of launching an arms race.
"We are not engaged in an arms race, but I have a responsibility to fully understand the threats we may face.
Parry recounted the surveillance of a French-Italian military satellite in 2017.
She said the spy was a Russian satellite.
Russia denies this claim.
Parry said France would soon have a small patrol satellite capable of detecting and tracking "the moles behind those unfriendly acts".
The French media attribute France’s quest for a space force to US President Donald Trump’s request last February for the US Department of Defense to draft a space force bill.
Trump signed the Defense Authorization Act last December, approving the creation of America’s sixth-largest military, the Space Force.
Some experts worry that the U.S. moves have accelerated the pace of U.S. space militarization and may trigger a new space arms race.

Shaanxi: Solving the Problem of Helping People after Relocation to Avoid People's "Running on Both Heads"
CCTV News: Aiming at the follow-up difficulties encountered by migrants in integrating into local life, Ankang Langao County, Shaanxi Province, has built a "good-neighbourly home" based on local innovations, guiding the villagers to move to become citizens, achieving stability, rapid integration and prosperity.
Langao County is located in the mountainous area of Qinba, where nearly one-third of the local population moved out of the mountains through immigration.
Qiao Changjiang, 39, moved from Zhongwu Village in Yanmen Town in Langao County to the Mingzhu community in Democracy Town.
He took his old-age insurance card to the community’s “good-neighborhood home,” where he completed his old-age insurance this year in less than two minutes.
Earlier this year, Langao County incorporated employment, civil affairs, medical insurance, and other businesses into its administration by building a "good-neighbourly home."
In the Mingzhu community, 305 residents entered local community factories through the "Good Neighbors' Home" employment information.
At present, more than 31 hundred households in Langao County have been resettled and community factories have been fully covered, providing employment for 2,598 people.
Shared Accommodation Market Rebounds in March, Report Says - Xinhua News Agency
The China Shared Accommodation Development Report 2020 (hereinafter referred to as the Report) released by the Research Center for Sharing Economics of the National Information Centre (NICC) in Beijing today shows that the share of transactions in China's shared accommodation market fell 72.1% year-on-year in the first five months of 2020 due to the impact of the epidemic.
However, the share accommodation market has been warming since March, with market volumes, orders and visitors gradually recovering.
According to the report, the share accommodation market deals fell sharply, partly due to a sharp decline in demand for travel accommodation under epidemic prevention and control, a sharp decline in order volume, a 65 per cent decline in total orders for the previous five months and a 63 per cent decline in the number of guests received.On the other hand, weak demand also led to a relatively sharp decline in overnight prices, with the average overnight price for the previous five months falling by 16 per cent year-on-year.
However, in March, April and May, market volumes increased by 78 per cent, 99 per cent and 35 per cent respectively, orders increased by 141 per cent, 152 per cent and 50 per cent respectively, and patronage rose by 81 per cent, 112 per cent and 28 per cent respectively.
The report noted that the development of the shared accommodation industry has been promising for a long time, but there are still many uncertainties in the recent past.
In response, Yu Fengxia, deputy director of the Center for Sharing Economic Research of the National Information Center, told the Workers' Daily that the development of shared accommodation requires stronger policy support.On the one hand, it is necessary to implement the policies already adopted in advance, further strengthen the policy coherence and focus on creating a better business environment; on the other hand, it is necessary to further stimulate consumption demand, enrich the supply of tourist accommodation services, innovative service modes and strengthen the government's cooperation with platform enterprises, and further increase the policy guidance and support.
Twenty-one people have been killed so far in a new outbreak at the plant of the world's largest steelmaker, Anselmital, in the Mexican city of Lázaro Cárdenas, Reuters reported.
It was reported that the secretary-general of the local branch of the Mexican Mining and Metallurgical Workers' Union, Antonio Solorio, said the dead included employees, contractors and suppliers of the factory.
Solorio says 21 people, including nine union members, have died at the plant since April.
Because the factory has adopted strict hygiene measures, workers are likely to be infected with the virus outside the factory.
According to the union, the factory has more than 7,000 employees.
As of July 25, Mexico had more than 385,000 confirmed cases and more than 40,000 deaths, making it the world's fourth-highest number of new coronary deaths.
Xiamen, July 26 (Jijiang Fushan, Zhang Shushan, Xu Jingzhen) - China's famous angiology center, Shanghai Changhai Hospital Angiology of Naval Medical University, signed an agreement with Xiamen University affiliated Zhongshan Hospital Angiology on July 25 to jointly establish a collaborative center to promote exchange and cooperation in the field of angiology, especially acute aortic disease.
Zhongshan Hospital, affiliated with Xia University, said that after the two hospitals' vascular surgeries formally form a collaborative unit, they will conduct remote consultations, formulate treatment plans with Changhai Hospital in real-time online consultations, select talents for further training, and jointly carry out weekly surgical technology exchange, teaching check-up rooms, and so on.For complicated cases, Changhai experts can be invited to the hospital to perform operations according to patients' needs, thereby realizing that patients in southwestern Minchuan can enjoy top medical resources in China without leaving the province.
The two hospitals will also work together to carry out innovative surgical research, aortic diseases and early screening, etc.
The Aortic Seminar, sponsored by the Beijing Health Promotion Association and sponsored by Zhongshan Hospital of Xiamen University, was held in Xiamen on the same day.
The signing ceremony of the Angio-surgical Collaboration Centre was held at the same time by the two renowned hospitals in Shanghai and Xiamen to announce the establishment of a collaborative unit to jointly improve the treatment of angio-surgical-related diseases in the southwest of Fujian.
Shanghai Changhai Hospital Vascular Surgery is the only Institute of Vascular Surgery in the army and the only clinical medical center of vascular system diseases in Shanghai. It is also the first major department of vascular surgery in the country.
Professor Huang Xiaojin, Director of Vascular Surgery at Zhongshan Hospital, Xiamen University, was interviewed by the media.
The Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, affiliated with the University of Xi'an Zhongshan Hospital, is the first independent department of cardiovascular surgery in Fujian Province, and has long been dedicated to the diagnosis and treatment of aortic and peripheral vascular diseases.
In the treatment of aortic diseases, besides the treatment of interlayered aneurysms and aortic aneurysms, we have extensive experience in the diagnosis of ruptured aortic aneurysms.
"The history of vascular surgery at Xiamen University's Sun Yat-sen Hospital, the scope, difficulty and complexity of operations, and so many other aspects are very outstanding in this region, so this time we have established a collaborative center, in addition to the aorta, we can also carry out in-depth cooperation in all aspects of medicine, teaching and scientific research in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases such as lower extremity artery and cervical artery," he said.
Professor Feng Rui, deputy director of vascular surgery at Shanghai Changhai Hospital, said.
Xiamen University's Sun Yat-sen Hospital and Shanghai Changhai Hospital signed a contract in 2018 to establish a digestive medicine "Li Zhaoxing Famous Medical Studio".
Professor Huang Xiaojin, director of the department of vascular surgery, told reporters on CNN that the department of vascular surgery and Changhai Hospital have a long history of exchange. The two hospitals have now formally formed a collaborative unit, enabling the two sides to cooperate and exchange on a new level.
He said the institute would regularly invite Shanghai experts to Xiamen to conduct exchanges of surgical techniques, conduct classroom visits, discuss cases of suspected diseases and so on.At the same time, the institute would further develop remote consultations, which are currently planned to be held once a week.
At the meeting, the reporters learned that vascular disease is the leading cause of death in China, and the aorta as the main artery of all organs of the human body, from the heart to the whole body, plays an important role.
The aortic disease is often associated with high risk, high mortality, and difficulty in treatment. The thickest section of the aorta, up to 4 cm in diameter, is at high risk of bleeding if an aneurysm develops and ruptures, or if an endothelial rupture creates a septum.
In recent years, as people's lifestyles change and the pace of life accelerates, China has become the world's largest country for high blood pressure, and aortic diseases have increased accordingly. Nowadays, with the development of surgical technology and industrial materials, the treatment of aortic diseases is continuously developing in the direction of minimally invasive, rapid and efficient.
Doctors can achieve good therapeutic results by inserting a stent from the thigh into the aorta to "transform" the blood flow, thus avoiding the impact of an aneurysm or ruptured septum, and in some operations even requiring local anesthesia.
This academic seminar invited more than ten domestic experts to discuss new advances in the treatment of aortic diseases, and conducted advanced technology training and discussion of suspected cases in the form of conference salon.
At the meeting, the reporters learned that with the development of surgical technology and industrial materials, the treatment of aortic diseases is continuously developing in the direction of minimally invasive, rapid and efficient.

The longest high-speed railway tunnel in the Three Gorges Reservoir Area - China New Railway Network
Author: Chen Haifeng Editor-in-Chief: Chen Haifeng
The picture shows the construction site of the Little Three Gorges Tunnel.
China Railways Chengdu Branch Group Co., Ltd.
China Railways Chengdu Bureau Group Co., Ltd. reported on July 26 that the 13.9-kilometer-long Zheng Wan High-Speed Railway's Little Three Gorges Tunnel would pass through the city on the same day.
It is understood that the Little Three Gorges Tunnel is not only the longest high-speed tunnel in the Three Gorges Reservoir Area, but also the longest single-hole double-track high-speed tunnel designed to reach 350 km/h in the projects currently under construction in China.
Zheng Wan high-speed railway is located in Henan, Hubei, and Chongqing three provinces, in Zhengzhou north to Beijing Guangdong, Xu Lan high-speed railway, in Wanzhou south to Yuan Wan high-speed railway arrives in Chongqing, is an important part of China's "eight-column eight-sided" high-speed railway network along the river channel and Hunan channel.
The entire route of the Zheng Wan high-speed railway passes through the Little Three Gorges Tunnel on the 26th.
The graph shows the permeation of the site.
Zheng Wan high-speed railway starts in Zhengzhou City, Henan Province, and runs southwest through Pingding City, Nanyang City, Xiangyang City, Hubei Province to Wanzhou District, Chongqing City, with a total length of about 818 km, design speed of 350 km/h, and about 184 km within Chongqing.
The Zhengzhou to Xiangyang section was opened on December 1, 2019, and the Chongqing section is accelerating construction.
The project is located at the junction of Fengjie County and Wushan County, Chongqing City, and is about 18.9 kilometers long and 890 meters deep.
Construction of the tunnel began in February 2017 and the entire line was completed on 26 July 2020.
According to Wang Guojun, the head of the design department of Zheng Wan High-speed Railway Tunnel, China Central Railway Secondary School Engineering Group Co., Ltd., the geological conditions of the Xiao Three Gorges Tunnel are very complicated, and it faces risks such as lava flow, mudslides, soft rock large deformation, and belongs to the I-class high-risk tunnel, and the tunnel design and construction are very difficult.
"During the construction of the project, we used geological surveying, physical exploration and advanced drilling methods to make advanced geological forecasts, and adopted special design schemes for more than 30 different types of holes. For example, we designed and constructed a bridge 24 meters long and a large hole with a longitudinal length of more than 10 meters and a depth of more than 55 meters across the tunnel to prevent the tunnel from sinking," Wang said.
According to the construction party, the Central Railway Tunnel Bureau, the tunnel construction, adopted a combination of evacuation and blockade, through the construction of horizontal tunnel flat guide, slurry blockade, strengthening the tunnel structure support and construction of sewage treatment station, not only ensured the orderly advancement of the project, but also avoided the construction drainage to the water body of the Small Three Gorges scenic area, while successfully overcoming the bad geology such as the large deformation of soft rock for 7 kilometers, the multi-tipped mud flooding with the maximum daily flow of 15.7 million cubic meters.
After the completion and opening of the Zheng Wan high-speed railway, it will become a new convenient and fast main passenger corridor to the Central Plains, North China and Northeast China in the southwest of China.It is of great significance to improve the capacity and quality of the railway corridor from the southwest to the northeast of China, improve the layout of the regional road network, accelerate the development of tourism resources and urbanization along the line, promote regional coordination and development, and promote the implementation of the strategy of large-scale development in the west.
Experts say gathering immigration data through the U.S. Census to allocate seats in the House of Representatives is unconstitutional
Some civil rights groups and several US cities and counties have filed lawsuits against the US federal government, claiming that the Trump administration's attempts to exclude undocumented immigrants from the US census are both unconstitutional and impractical.
The United States Census will determine the distribution of seats in the United States House of Representatives.
"It's not going to work," Sarah Brannon, executive attorney for the American Civil Rights League, told VOA.
She went on to say that Trump's demands for a census to determine the citizenship of the census takers were difficult to achieve and "not very reliable."
Another civil-rights group, Common cause, filed a lawsuit Thursday challenging Trump’s executive order.
Several cities in New Jersey and Georgia joined the lawsuit.
Arlington County, Virginia, joined the suit Friday.
"The U.S. Constitution requires us to accurately count our population every 10 years, and we must accurately count everyone who lives in Arlington County," said Gary Garvey, chairman of Arlington County's board of directors.
Other organizations and individuals have praised President Trump’s executive orders.
Alabama Attorney General Marshall called the executive order a "victory" for the state.
"The allocation of seats in the House of Representatives and electoral districts in each state must be based on the number of residents residing in the states and the number of residents legally resident," he said.
The US Supreme Court last year prevented the Trump administration from including citizenship in the 2020 census.
President Donald Trump signed an executive order earlier this week directing U.S. Census Bureau Trade Secretary Robert Ross to submit census data on undocumented populations so that the administration can exclude them from state census figures, thereby determining whether each state increases or decreases or maintains seats in the House of Representatives.
Every 10 years, the United States redistributes seats in the House of Representatives according to demographic changes.

Hunan in the peak of summer, hot waves.
And the province's industrial project construction promotes the enthusiasm released by the on-site sightseeing, over three-hundred-days of intense heat, "Industry versus strength, project heroism" is the clear direction that stirred up the three provinces and four waters.
The development of Hunan always depends on building projects and fostering industries.
Faced with the extraordinary first half of the year, under the strong leadership of the Central Committee, with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, the entire province has persisted in playing a game of chess, devoting all its efforts to fighting the two hard battles of preventing epidemics and floods, and using industrial projects as the “first moves” in implementing the “six-steady” and “six-guarantee” principles.
From a 1.9% year-on-year decline in GDP in the first quarter, to a 1.3% year-on-year increase in the first half, it goes without saying that the period was difficult and the effort enormous.
In this precious list of achievements, industrial project construction is the key support to accelerate Hunan's economic recovery and development stability.
The momentum is steady and irreversible.
The construction of industrial projects should be put into the big picture, be good at accumulating potential, accumulating potential, seeking potential, and be good at understanding change, seeking change, and responding to change.
In the context of the current complicated and severe international situation, in addition to the painstaking efforts to attract investment, it is necessary to study the new features of the current new situation, grasp the rules more accurately and scientifically, and better integrate into the new development pattern promoted by the large domestic cycle and the bilateral domestic and international cycles.
Greater emphasis will be placed on upgrading the industry's basic capabilities.
In the first half of the year, our province not only has a large number of heavy-weight investment projects in emerging industries to break ground and sow hope, but also has traditionally superior industrial enterprises to accelerate the industrial transformation of digitization, intelligence and greening.
The new factory area of the Changde Cigarette Factory in Hunan Province is dedicated to the process of intelligent transformation and construction of modern factories, and is also a vivid picture of the "old tree sprouting new shoots"Around the country's major strategy and the "two new ones", we will strive to consolidate the promotion of superior industries, actively cultivate the development of new industries, and increase technological innovation and domestic substitution in a comprehensive manner, in order to consolidate the basic conditions and accumulate the dynamic energy of transformation.
More attention should be paid to fostering the development of new economy and new business modes.
In the first half of the year, computer and office equipment manufacturing, electronics and communication equipment manufacturing in our province grew by 12.6%, wholesale retail enterprises over the limit online retail sales by 32.2% year-on-year, and catering enterprises online meal fees revenue by 35.6% year-on-year.
It is the tendency to nurture new opportunities in the crisis and open up new ones in the changing situation, actively promote digital industrialization and industrial digitization, and guide the integration of the digital economy and the real economy.
We will pay more attention to optimizing and stabilizing the supply chain of industrial chains.
Engineering machinery is Hunan industry's main army, but two-thirds of the supporting enterprises are outside the province, there is still room and potential in the supporting chain.
Strengthening industrial chain thinking and grasping projects requires not only the continuous accumulation of leading enterprises, but also the realization of technological breakthroughs in key links in the industrial chain; it also requires the cultivation of the latent hearts of all regions to stimulate the "chain" lock reaction by strengthening the chain and extending the chain, to promote the coordinated layout of related supporting industries, and to accelerate the construction of independently controllable, safe and reliable industrial chain supply chains.
Hunan is still a hot land of good business environment and market opportunities.
In the process of recovering the losses caused by the epidemic, all kinds of "thousands and hundreds of measures" were taken to find the short-term pain points, the bright stories of success and danger.
A focus on researching, nurturing and developing industries, and firmly optimizing the business environment will surely win the favour of more investors.
The winds and waves are still in the foreground, but the state of breaking the winds and waves has become the normality of catching up with the construction of industrial projects and promoting the development of the economy in the upper and lower parts of the province.
During this critical period, we must learn and implement the spirit of the series of important instructions and approvals issued by the President-in-Office of the People's Republic of China, respond effectively to external uncertainties with the certainty of our own work, steadily push forward the construction of industrial projects, share enthusiasm and sweat, and ensure the successful completion of the "Thirteenth Five-Year Plan" and China's economic growth and development.

Employment and Prices Overall Steady Show "Temperature" in the Economy
China Economic Daily, China Economic Network.
In the first half of this year, faced with the impact of the epidemic of pneumonia, China has coordinated efforts to promote epidemic prevention and control and economic and social development, the epidemic prevention and control situation has been steadily improving, the steady recovery of the economy is evident, employment and prices, which are closely related to people's livelihoods, have been generally stable, and the Chinese economy has submitted a warm economic performance report.
The survey unemployment rate rose in the first two months of this year.
In particular, in February, many enterprises' production and operation activities were essentially suspended, demand for workers decreased, recruitment was delayed or cancelled, and the unemployment rate in urban surveys rose.
With the gradual improvement of the epidemic prevention and control situation, the order of production and life of the whole society is continuously restored.
The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) insists on the overall basic tone of its efforts to secure steady progress, further intensifies macroeconomic policy countermeasures, strengthens employment priority policies in an all-round manner, and actively promotes the work of supporting enterprises to secure and expand employment.
China has stepped up its policy to hedge against job insecurity, launched a policy mix of "deductions, exemptions and repayments," phased-in deductions and exemptions from the payment of three social insurance units, allowed delays in the payment of social insurance contributions, expanded the return of unemployment insurance to small and medium-sized enterprises on a steady basis, benefited from the worker-on-the-job training policy, and granted subsidies and apprenticeship subsidies to enterprises to absorb the employment of key groups.
With the implementation of various employment stabilization policies, the demand for workers by enterprises steadily increased, the employment situation gradually improved, and the urban unemployment survey rate gradually fell, and in June, the survey unemployment rate was 5.7%.
Zhang Yi, director of the Population and Employment Statistics Division of the National Bureau of Statistics, said that in the second quarter, various employment policies continued to be effective, and the labor force that had withdrawn due to the epidemic in the previous quarter was gradually returning, and the labour participation rate in urban areas rose by about 10 percentage points in June compared to February, which was close to the level of the same period of the previous year.
The figures show that the total number of jobs in urban areas rose more than 19% in June compared to February, with most industries reaching the pre-epidemic level.The average weekly working hours of enterprise employees reached 46.8 hours, up 6.6 hours from February and slightly more than 0.1 hours from January.
Prices also affect thousands of households.
In January, the CPI rose 5.4 per cent year-on-year, the highest it has seen in years.
In February, year-on-year growth in the CPI remained in the “five-zone” despite a slight decline.
The year-on-year increase in CPI was at a high level, driven not only by consumer demand before the Spring Festival, but also by the wrong month and lower year-on-year base figures.
However, the effect of pneumonia epidemic on prices is particularly pronounced.
Due to the prevention and control of the epidemic, delays in logistics, inadequate supplies of materials and increased transportation costs were observed throughout the country in January and February.
In order to cope with the disturbance caused by the epidemic prevention and control to the price situation, the relevant departments have included important living materials in the scope of emergency transportation protection to ensure the smooth transportation of materials.
Under the influence of a series of policy measures, the supply of vegetables and fruits in the market is strongly guaranteed.
To cope with the rapid rise in pigmeat prices at the beginning of this year, the central government has introduced a policy of price stability in supply and demand, which has been implemented rapidly by all regions and departments, and the supply of pigmeat from the pigmeat reserves has improved markedly, pig production capacity has been restored in an orderly manner, and the order of production and sale has gradually become normal.
Since March, the price of pork has been falling steadily, leading to a year-on-year increase in food prices of 10.6% in May.In June, the price of pork has risen slightly due to the slowdown in the production of piglets, a reduction in imports and a rise in demand for group consumption.
The seasonal variation in the price of fresh vegetables was evident, with an average increase of 3.4 per cent in the first half.
Fresh fruit prices continued to fall year-on-year, falling 13.3% on average in the first half of the year, due to higher base figures compared to the same period last year.
The basic life of the masses is effectively guaranteed and the general economic and social situation remains stable and orderly.
With the gradual resumption of transportation logistics, the strengthening of supply and demand insurance in various places, the market supply and demand situation improved.
At the start of March, the CPI fell for four consecutive months, and year-on-year growth fell from 4.3 per cent in March to 2.5 per cent in June.
In the second half of the year, China's prices will continue to remain moderate, and overall inflationary pressure will be moderate.However, we still need to restore the order of production and life on the premise that epidemic prevention and control are normalized.
We will respond effectively to natural disasters such as flooding and drought in the main producing areas of agricultural products such as grains, fruits and vegetables, strengthen market supervision, and resolutely combat acts that disturb market order such as hoarding and extortion of prices.

"Sweet" Carrying Goods Helps Farmers Raise Yields in Qinghai Lakeside Flowers and Sea Broadcasting Hall, Hainan, July 26, China News Agency (China News Agency)
Author Hu Guilong Pan Yujie
"In the summer, the lakeside of Qinghai is full of golden flowers and dancing bees. Its high altitude, great difference in day and night temperature, low air pollution, and strong sunlight have nurtured the most tenacious and generous bee colony, which has made Qinghai Bee King Ju high in activity, high in protein, rich in nutritional value, low in sugar and low in fat.
Zhang Jianxun, deputy director of the Industry and Information Administration of the Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture of Hainan, Qinghai Province, said on Sunday.
On the same day, the live delivery of bee products was held on the shore of the Qinghai Lake.The Chinese Bee Products Association and representatives of entrepreneurs, bee farmers and others gathered together to promote the characteristic bee products of Qinghai.
The picture shows the bee products at the bee farmer's site.
It is reported that the live delivery campaign, with the help of the network of beekeeping chain stores in Beijing, such as Quick Hand, Taobao and other well-known domestic bee products retail enterprises, live and electronic platforms, promotes the exchange and cooperation of "enterprises + bee farmers + growers," and through online and offline channels to continue to issue "Qinghai Plateau Spring Pulp Consumer Coupons" to consumers, the enterprises are expected to yield a total of nearly 52.8 million yuan.
In response, Wu Na, president of Beijing Hou De Li Bee Industry Co., Ltd., said it was "very worthwhile": "This move will increase the visibility of Qinghai's bee products, attract more consumers to understand, like pure natural bee products without additives, and drive bee farmers to increase yields.
At present, the company has signed a production cooperation strategy agreement with Qinghai Yun Bee Industry Co. Ltd. and Qinghai Hua Bao Bee Industry Co. Ltd., hoping to jointly promote the long-term development of the local beekeeping industry in Qinghai.
The picture shows the sea of rape blossoms on the shores of Qinghai Lake.
This spring, roadblocks have been put in place to prevent and control the epidemic. Beekeepers have been blocked on their way from one flower to the next. Many bees have died because they missed the blooming season and lack food, and their incomes have been severely affected.
"At the beginning of the year, beekeepers made long journeys from Yunnan and Sichuan provinces to the northwestern part of the country.
As a company, we have a responsibility to help them.
"Wanna Says".
"Little bees are environmental scouts, and bees cannot survive in areas with serious pollution," said Zhao Xiaochuan, deputy chairman of the China Bee Products Association.Pollination is an important link in the ecological chain and plays an irreplaceable role in protecting plant diversity and improving the ecological environment.
At the same time, bee pollination can increase the productivity and improve the quality of crops, especially in areas of widespread cultivation and poor management conditions, pollination is more meaningful.
Research shows that pollination can increase the yield of oilseed rape by about 15–30%.
The picture shows Zhao Xiaochuan (right), vice president of China Bee Products Association, promoting Qinghai bee products.
"The economic, ecological and social benefits of bee pollination far outweigh the value of bee products themselves. The potential of the beekeeping industry for human health, crop production, vegetation reproduction and ecological protection has been little known.
Zhao Xiaochuan said.
Nowadays, the number of beekeepers is decreasing, and besides the beekeepers who are always on the move, there are many poor people who are unable to move and choose to participate in cooperatives with beehives.
"The state has financial support, and we have contacted technicians to help guide us. Bee farmers lack understanding and judgment about the market environment. To open markets, they also need the help and coordination of the government, enterprises and industry associations," he said.
said Zhao Xiaochuan.
"We hope that in the future more attention will be paid to helping bee-keeping groups," Wu said. "Our bee products will also be strictly screened and controlled according to national standards to ensure quality and protect consumers' rights while helping bee farmers."

U.S. White House adviser "anti-biting" states too early to resume work-CNN
U.S. White House advisers "anti-bite" states to resume work too early
On July 23 local time, the number of confirmed cases of new coronary pneumonia in the United States surpassed four million, accounting for 30% of cases worldwide.
For months, US President Donald Trump repeatedly urged states to restart schooling, until he recently changed his mind, taking the initiative to wear masks in public, and his advisers have “taken a backseat” to saying that some state governments are restarting too soon.
On the 22nd, White House adviser Carrie Conway told a news conference that some state governments had failed to comply with the reopening standards and had reopened places such as bars too early.
Conway also noted that earlier claims that the president had "absolute authority" to decide on state reconstruction were misleading.
The president is a federalist, and he believes that each state has autonomy.
She defended Trump.
Conway’s “rumours,” however, were spoken out by Trump at a White House briefing on the outbreak on April 13.
This self-deprecating operation has been ridiculed by netizens as "rewriting history".
Carrie Conway wants to rewrite history. She's a liar.
Trump called Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmore a dictator because she followed medical guidelines and insisted on a shutdown.
Trump wants to push for reconstruction so that he can hold a rally.
This is not the first time that Carrie Conway has caused controversy.
On April 15, in an interview with Fox News, Conway blurted out, "This is COVID-19, not COVID-1, my friends!"
She seems to understand "19" as a version number, by netizens madly exclaimed: If you do not have common sense, look at the newspaper!

The playground was smashed and the children appealed to the school after receiving compensation
Zhao Yifan, correspondent of this newspaper
Three-year-old Xiao Wen was playing on a college playground when he was hit in the head by a baseball pitcher named Chen Sung.
As a result of the court's decision, the school's board of directors ordered the school to pay $20,000 in damages, and the school's board of trustees ordered the school to pay $20,000 in damages.
Recently, the Haidian District People's Court in Beijing dismissed the plaintiff's lawsuit on the grounds that the school had set up a safety net on the playground at the time of the incident and had fulfilled its duty to provide adequate security, and that Chen had made compensation.
Mr. Wen alleged that during the summer vacation of 2019, he played with Mr. Wen at the school playground while the baseball team was training on the playground.
In order to avoid the risks involved, Mr. Wen, Mr. Wen and many other children and parents are allowed to play in the safe areas designated by the baseball team.
But then the baseball player Chen Sung took off his hand while pitching, causing the baseball to fly over the net into the above-mentioned safety zone and hit Xiao Wen's back brain.
Mr. Wen immediately took Xiao Wen to the hospital for treatment, was diagnosed as a head injury.
Mr Wen believes that the facilities of the school playground do not comply with the relevant safety regulations and do not manage the teams and related facilities effectively.
The school's negligence led to the above-mentioned incidents, which resulted in great pain for Xiao Wen, both physically and mentally, and also brought great pain to his family, and the school should bear legal responsibility for this.
In response, the school argued that the school had set up a safety net at the playground, posted management regulations and training notices, told children to keep a safe distance from the playground and reminded them of their own safety, and that the plaintiff could not prove that the school "did not meet its obligation to ensure safety" and therefore did not agree to compensation.
The court held that the place where the incident occurred was a place open to the public free of charge by the university in question, and that although the school had an obligation to safeguard the management of the playground, such an obligation could only be fulfilled by meeting the general duty of care.
At the time of the incident, the school had set up a safety net on the playground, and had done its utmost to ensure proper safety, and Chen Shang also compensated Xiao Wen for medical expenses, transportation costs and other losses of more than 2,000 yuan in accordance with the previous compensation agreement, the two sides agreed to settle the dispute once and for all.
After the incident, Xiao Wen's parents again claimed the school's compensation, and the court ruled that the plaintiff's appeal was dismissed.
Neither side appealed the verdict, which is now in effect.
According to Article 37 of the tort liability law of our country, a school, as the manager of a public place, has the obligation of security; in the event that the act of a third party causes damage to others, the third party bears the tort liability, and the manager of a public place who has not fulfilled the obligation of security shall bear the corresponding supplementary liability.
The judge said that since as the manager of a public place, it is most likely to know the actual situation of the whole place, foresee the risks and damages that may occur, thus it is most likely to take the necessary measures to prevent the occurrence of losses or mitigate the extent of damages, and the cost of avoiding and mitigating the occurrence of damages is the lowest, so the law stipulates that it undertakes the corresponding guarantee obligation to engage in social activities.
In the present case, the school's obligation to ensure the safety of the unspecified entrants to the playground, which is open to the public free of charge, should be commensurate with the social activities it engages in. Specifically, it should mainly take basic safety measures and have an obligation to inform the public of the hidden dangers.
In the judicial practice, it is also not advisable to impose excessive safety guarantee obligations on the managers of public places.
If the school has already established a safety net and has done its duty to inform, it can be determined that the school has no fault and should not be held legally liable.
Furthermore, in the event of infringement by a third party, even if the manager of a public place, such as a school, fails to fulfil his obligation to ensure safety, his liability is supplemented by compensation for damages.
Therefore, in such accidents, the victim should not extend the scope of claims after having received compensation from the directly infringing party.
With the normalization of epidemic prevention and control, people's enthusiasm for sports and fitness is on the rise.
With the gradual liberalization of the cross-provincial tourism business, the tourism market is about to recover.
Fujian Province resumed cross-provincial tourism operations on July 21, the first weekend after opening, Xiamen, a popular tourist destination, greeted the peak of tourist flow.
As a popular tourist destination city, Xiamen is visited by many tourists on weekends.
Xiamen railway station is expected to send 3.7 million passengers during the summer season, while the airport's passenger flow is dominated by students, tourism, and family visits.
As the tourism market gradually warmed, Xiamen Airport operated 440 daily flights in July, and domestic flights had recovered to 80% of their pre-epidemic levels.
The airlines have encrypted the high-speed airlines from Xiamen to Shanghai, Beijing, Kunming, Xi'an and other major cities, grabbing the revived tourism market.
At present, Xiamen a number of travel agencies have launched a series of domestic cross-provincial tour products in the summer, team trips are mainly outdoor attractions.
In response to the peak of summer passenger traffic at railway stations and airports, the relevant units dispatched additional personnel to evacuate people in areas where people were easily assembled, such as on-call counters and security checkpoints, Fujian also optimized and upgraded the "Eight Fujian Health Code," and achieved health data sharing and mutual recognition with 31 provinces, promoting an orderly recovery of the tourism market.

Israel Strengthens Prevention and Control of Repeated Outbreaks-CNN News

Israel Strengthens Repeated Epidemic Prevention and Control
In the early stages of the outbreak, Israel's preventive and control measures were effective.
However, with the gradual lifting of control measures, the number of new cases of pneumonia diagnosed in Israel has risen markedly in the recent past, and the Israeli Government has taken emergency measures to strengthen the control of the epidemic on several occasions.
On 28 February, the first case of new coronary pneumonia was diagnosed in Israel, prompting the closure of all ports of entry and exit, suspension of unnecessary industries, switching of schools to online classes, restrictions on public transport and unnecessary social activities, blockade of cities with serious epidemics, and joint military-police efforts to maintain control and prevention.
The series of measures quickly proved to be successful, and by mid-May, the number of new cases of new coronary pneumonia diagnosed in Israel had dropped to one in a single day.
As the epidemic was brought under control, Israel's preventive and control measures were completely lifted, and since June the number of new confirmed cases of pneumonia had gradually rebounded.
Especially after July, the spread of the epidemic has been accelerating.
More than 1,500 new cases a day have been reported in Israel over the past eight days, with 916 new cases reported on the same day as of the publication of the report on July 25.
As of 25 July, there were 59745 confirmed cases and 448 deaths in Israel.
Faced with the rapid rebound of the epidemic, the Israeli government has repeatedly taken emergency measures to strengthen the prevention and control of the epidemic.
On July 6, after the number of confirmed cases exceeded 30,000, the Israeli government closed gyms, swimming pools, bars, nightclubs, and other public places of entertainment, and imposed restrictions on public transportation, requiring no more than 20 passengers per bus.
On the 17th, the government announced a series of new restrictions, including the introduction of a curfew on weekends, stipulating that curfews would be imposed between 5 p.m. and 5 a.m. on Fridays and Sundays.
During this period, shops, malls, barbershops, beauty salons, libraries, zoos, museums, galleries, swimming pools and tourist attractions will be closed, while basic services such as supermarkets and pharmacies will remain open.
At the same time, meetings of more than 10 people will be prohibited on all dates and times, gyms, studios, etc. will be closed, restaurants and cafes will be closed to patrons, and only out-of-pocket services will be permitted.
At the same time, the Israeli people have not paid sufficient attention to the seriousness of the epidemic and have not been able to form a coalition with the government in the fight against the epidemic.
After repeated outbreaks of the disease in Israel, many people took to the streets to protest the government's control measures affecting their own economic interests.
On 11 July, tens of thousands of people demonstrated in Tel Aviv, claiming that anti-epidemic policies were affecting the economy.
On the evening of the 21st, thousands of protesters gathered in front of Netanyahu's official residence in Jerusalem, protesting against Netanyahu's ban on restaurants, cafeterias, and other restrictive measures without compensation.
In addition, many people do not wear a mask while outdoor activities, maintain two meters of safe social distance, and to avoid being fined by police for not wearing a mask, many people wear a mask only on the chin or hanging on the wrist.
During the recurrence of the epidemic, the school is a severe disaster area for the spread of the new crown virus, and according to a recent visit to the kindergarten, teachers and students in the kindergarten did not wear masks as required by the government, nor maintain two meters of safe social distance between each other, for a large number of teachers and students infected with the virus hidden dangers.
Professor Eli Waxman, a member of the National Security Council's expert advisory group on combating the epidemic, believes that Israel is heading towards a "dangerous situation", pointing out that Israel's current epidemic prevention and control measures are not sufficient and that all recreational and entertainment venues and summer schools should be closed in order to control the epidemic's further spread.
Mr. Waxman said Israel lacks a comprehensive plan to combat the epidemic, and that parliament and government departments should abandon their interests as soon as possible and agree on clear steps to combat the epidemic, including restrictions on different sectors.
The newspaper's correspondent in Tel Aviv, Wang Jiang, said by wire in Tel Aviv on July 25
Ningxia Guyuan farmer Wu Fengfang reluctantly but the old companion's son to wear heavenly blessings, two people in a car, from 20 miles away from home, to the Liangyun Cultural University.
Despite these two years of inconvenience, 77-year-old Dai Tianfu hopes to “come here every three to five years and get hooked.”
This is a remarkable courtyard in Yuyuan City, Yuanzhou District, and unlike ordinary farmhouses, the courtyard is often spreading a cheerful Qin-cause, there are wonderful scenery, embroidered works, traditional Qin-cause, eyebrow drama, etc.
The owner of the manor, Liang Yun, was once a carpenter.
More than a decade ago, he, who loves film and singing, began planning the construction of a cultural college.
The cultural life of the villagers has become rich and colorful with the establishment of Liangyun Cultural University.
The reporter has not yet entered the Liangyun Cultural University, the tune of Qin has been passed out.
The neighboring villagers Li Xiang are singing Qin songs for the villagers.
She loved Qin from her childhood and is now a minor celebrity in the area. Whenever she has free time, she will come to the Cultural Hall to perform programs for the locals.
Recently, she's been playing live on the net.
"It's a happy thing to have a stage where more people can see you perform," she said.
On stage, the singer at a glance, the player in tune, though amateur, but enthusiasm is not diminished in the slightest.
Just like the rustic style of the farmhouse, the "grassroots" art and non-heritage culture in the Liangyun Cultural Hall come together outside the Qin Room.
It also houses more than 300 artifacts, including agricultural implements from different ages, traditional and handmade tiles, paper clippings, embroidery, and leather shades.
Liang Yun led the reporter into the exhibition hall in the courtyard, where he displayed his collection of old objects, an old wine kettle, three strings, a spinning wheel, etc.
Why does an ordinary peasant build a cultural college?
"Picture theater is my family's handicraft, and I've been studying it since I was 15," he said.
Liang Yun Cultural University was established in 2012, and became Ningxia's first rural "intangible cultural heritage exhibition hall", as well as the demonstration university for the protection of intangible cultural heritage in Guyuan City.
In addition to the Liangyun Cultural Institute, the Yueyuan District of Yueyuan City has emerged more than 120 cultural institutes, 79 folk performing groups, among them, there are more than 50 cultural institutes of a certain size, such as Shenjiahe Cultural Institute, Wang Yonghong Cultural Institute, Yang Lang Cultural Institute, etc., covering the townships and streets of the Yueyuan District, attended by more than 5,000 people.
These grassroots artists are active in the countryside, enriching the cultural life of the masses and satisfying their spiritual needs.
"As life gets better and better, traditional culture cannot be dropped like this.

The 40th episode of the spy war drama "Winning Numbers" will be aired on Beijing TV on July 16.
The book is based on the Soviet military archives, which were sealed for many years and first appeared.
Liu Yunlong, an actor known to audiences for his spy dramas, broke through the image in the play, challenging a rather cheerful "mouth-eating agent".
In recent years, the popularity of such dramas as The Undercover, Mask, and Kite, all prove that spy warfare type dramas have a vigorous vitality.
Unlike its predecessors, the game is set in the Soviet Far East.
It is set in the final stages of the 1944 Anti-Japanese War, and tells the story of Chinese Communist Party secret intelligence officer Tang Fei (柳云龙) who, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China's Linhe Provincial Committee secretary and the Soviet Director of Far Eastern Intelligence, executes the Soviet Far Eastern Intelligence Bureau's "Mudanura" plot operation.
In many spy dramas, the main character as a high-ranking spy, the appearance is a handsome, high-intelligence, mature perfect image.
But in Liu Yunlong's opinion, such a person is not suited to be a spy. "A spy should be the kind of person who can't be found in a pile of people, if the appearance is that very handsome image, I wish everyone would pay attention to you, can you still hide?
Thus, in "Winning Calculation", Liu Yunlong did not take the initiative to design his main character Tang Fei as a "mouth-eating agent" with a sense of joy.
The other side of the battle was supported by Fukuhara, portrayed by Liang Guanhua, and Sebao Fang, the head of the police department, portrayed by Li Li Guang.
Both the north and south sides of the power play bones, for the whole play adds a lot of expert oversights.
Director Yin Fei describes the rivalry between Li Li and Liu Yunlong as "absolutely a soap opera.They are two very special people, and the kind of harmony in them is very shocking to me.Many times their plays are 'hanging', for example, we wrote only half a page of paper, and I didn't stop shouting at the time of shooting, and they could go on and on.
When the actors are all in the roles and ensure their character status, not only can the character be shaped from the perspective of the character, but also to bring the audience more viewing possibilities, Yin Fei said such a play is sufficiently colorful.
In the play, you can also see many familiar faces in the "Liu's spy warfare", the famous "F4 Mountain City" in "Kites" for a while, the imposing, and in the "Winning Calculation" also gathered three.
He played the roles of Song Xiao'an and Zhao Jianzhi's Hou Yu and Liu Nayang, this time again playing Tang Fei's left arm and right arm.
Director Yin Fei introduced, "These two people have no inferiority, they just follow the flow in that time, that environment.
Liu Yunlong also suggested, "We need to have a sense of compassion. This sense of compassion means that the people around me must have good and bad, and the bad people are the enemy, but we must also develop them, and our troops must also be strengthened.
The ending of the play is also carefully designed by Liu Yunlong, who believes he will give the audience a satisfactory answer.

Hong Kong's financial market remains active and orderly, said Xu Zhengyu, the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, Xinhua news agency reported on July 25.
He expressed optimism about Hong Kong's financial stability and economy.
"Hong Kong is experiencing difficulties due to the 'recurrent outbreak' and the outbreak of pneumonia," Mr Hui said at an online seminar organised by the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in Toronto and the Hong Kong-Canadian Chamber of Commerce (Canadian Chamber of Commerce) on 24 October (Toronto time).
The Hong Kong dollar exchange rate is stable and favours the exchange guarantee level of the stronger party.
The banking system has not seen any significant outflows; on the contrary, more than $11 billion has flowed in since June.
Bank deposits have also continued to rise in the past few months, and the stock market has seen a series of public offerings and rising market volumes.
Mr Hui said the outbreak of pneumonia was putting pressure on the global economy and financial markets, but Hong Kong's fundamental advantages remained unchanged.
Hong Kong's many advantages, including geography, the rule of law, high-speed communications, the free flow of information and capital, and a simple, low-tax system, continue to make Hong Kong a leading international financial centre.
Mr Hui pointed out that the Government had set aside HK$6 billion in the "Epidemic Prevention and Control Fund" to create about 30,000 temporary jobs in the public and private sectors over the next two years, covering people with different skills and qualifications.
To support the development of financial technology, the HKSAR Government has also launched the Thousand People Scheme to support local financial technology companies, start-ups and other enterprises with financial technology-related business to create 1,000 new jobs, employ local talent and enrich Hong Kong's financial technology talent pool.
Looking ahead, Mr Hui expressed optimism about Hong Kong's financial stability and economy.
He encouraged Canadian companies to take advantage of Hong Kong's position as an international financial centre, an international asset and wealth management centre and a global offshore renminbi business hub to develop and invest in Guangdong, Hong Kong, Macao and the Gulf of Guangdong and the surrounding areas.
China's Anti-Epidemic Efforts Praised in the Journal of Willow Blade-Chinanews.net
As a country with a population of 1.4 billion and a size similar to that of Europe or the United States, China has effectively controlled the outbreak of the new crown disease at this stage and has largely contained the country's epidemic without a large-scale outbreak, Liu Yedao said in a 25th-day issue of Liu Yedao magazine.
China has invested heavily in domestic research and public health over the past decade, making it much better prepared for new crowns than it was for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), the article said.
At the time of the SARS outbreak in 2002, China was initially underprepared, especially for the uncertainty of the pathogen, the authors said.
When the new crown virus was discovered in December 2019, Chinese scientists were quickly able to identify the virus species and shared genome sequencing data with the international community on January 11, 2020.
By the end of January, doctors from mainland China and Hong Kong had elucidated the clinical characteristics of the virus and warned the world of the threat of the new crown virus by publishing a study in The Lancet.
China has also been at the forefront of vaccine research, which has been conducted very quickly and rigorously through close cooperation within the country in times of state-declared emergency, and the results of early trials of a new crown vaccine developed in China were published in May and July, respectively, in The Lancet.
China's experience shows that it is very important to invest in the national health and research system and effectively improve laboratory capacity.
This is the basis for a rapid and effective national response to health emergencies and global health security.
Other countries, especially low- and middle-income countries, are worth learning from.
Moreover, China’s experience has shown that, on the basis of strong research, strong high-level decision-makers must be decisive in making the right decisions based on scientific evidence, so that the new crop epidemic can be effectively controlled.
The article emphasizes that governments and their leaders must respect science, understand its value, and act on it in ways that are most beneficial to society.
In the early stages of the outbreak, the China National Defense and Construction Commission dispatched three groups of infectious disease experts to Wuhan to investigate the risks and spread of the new crown virus.Their recommendations provided the basis for the decision to seal off Wuhan on January 23.When experts suggested the necessity and urgency of building a square-cell hospital, the government quickly made a decision and implemented it quickly.
Finally, the article emphasizes that in response to global health emergencies, countries need to strengthen global cooperation and jointly respond.

Of the newly diagnosed cases, 5 were local community cases, 4 were imported cases and the rest were foreign workers living in special dormitories.

There are still 173 new coronary patients in hospital, most of whom are stable or improving, and no one is in a critical care ward.
In addition, 4,648 people were segregated from community facilities.
Foreign workers make up the vast majority of Singapore's new crown infected population.
According to statistics, there are 200,000 foreign workers living in 43 foreign workers' dormitories, and about 100,000 foreign workers living in other types of dormitories.
Singapore's government is stepping up testing for the last few foreign workers' dormitories with higher rates of new crown infection, the interdepartmental anti-epidemic task force said.
The vast majority of foreign workers will be able to return to work after the completion of all occupational housing tests, but they will still have to undergo periodic new examinations.
Winner of the Golden Globe Award for Best Director for "Good Luck" by Dapeng - Official website
On 18 July, the 23rd Shanghai International Film Festival announced the official list of films to be selected for the Golden Globe Awards.
Dapeng's first real-life film, Good Luck Like It, was successfully screened at the Shanghai Film Festival, and the film officially released its first poster.
Poster sheets for illustration
The film was the first real-life film directed by Dapeng, and he also had a two-time tie to the Golden Globe.
The film tells the story of a comedic director who comes back to his old home in the northeastern countryside, hoping to make a film about his family's New Year's holidays.
Family members gathered for the filming and finished the final party.
In today’s poster, a member of the family, Wang Jiaoqiang, sits smoking in the center of the picture, against a silver-clad northeastern black landscape, with the red lanterns that Chinese must hang at New Year’s Eve in the foreground.
The red lantern, which symbolizes joy and unity, contrasts greatly with the lonely king's auspicious sign, which seems to reveal the complexity and entanglement of this family relationship.
It is reported that in the film, except for the "three uncles" Wang Jiaoqiang's daughter played by actor Liu Lu, the rest of the scenes were completed by the real director's family, the film's experimental audio-visual style broke the boundary between drama and reality, bringing the audience a new immersive viewing experience.
According to director Dapeng, the film’s inspiration came from “a divine will,” a series of sudden changes in the family during filming that forced the original filming plan to change, with life without a script ultimately recorded in the film, but unleashing tensions that transcended design.
How does director Dapeng face this " will of heaven ", and how should continue to meet the changes brought by this will of heaven?
There is no doubt that Lucky Charms is full of experimental, almost amateur line-up and innovative audio-visual style that turns the life in front of the camera into a movie. Under the wrapping of the real image, the audience will also find themselves and their family's shadow from the family presented in the film, as the end of the family reunion in the film, arouses a series of thoughts.

Batong Zhongkang sentry post, platoon Chang Yuwang and a soldier on duty station.
In a place where the average annual temperature is less than ten degrees centigrade, a row of simple barracks stands at the mouth of the mountain. Not far from the barracks, a flag flutters in the breeze, and soldiers are on duty in the wind every day, while regularly patrolling higher altitudes.
The soldiers climbed the steep slopes of the quarries, using their hands and feet.
At the end of July, the low-lying areas were full of flowers and plants, while in Batong Zhongkang, only the trenches behind the camp were relatively dense in green.
Gao Peng, a soldier who had been stationed at the sentry post for six years, pointed to the ditch and said that this was their back garden. It was only in July and August each year that the grass grew slowly, and soon afterwards it turned yellow and covered with snow.
Hiking can take up to nine hours.
Under harsh plateau conditions, the soldiers stationed here are often accompanied by snowy mountains and glaciers, and they also regularly patrol higher altitudes.
Yesterday, a patrol of eight soldiers, led by instructor Liang Yixian, once again went on patrol.
Each soldier weighs about 30 kg and heads for the target early in the morning.
A soldier was on the way, and his comrades rushed to rescue him.
In addition to their patrol duties, the soldiers at the Bagucheon sentry station undergo tactical and physical training on a daily basis.
One minute at a time, rising altitudes, decreasing oxygen levels, and overexertion test the will of the patrol.
They persisted in biting their teeth, successively crossed several landslides, crossed several hurricane-prone beaches.
At 4:00 p.m., it was lunch time for the patrols. They took out their dried food and sat on the ground at an altitude of over 5,700 meters, accompanied by rain and snow, to replenish their strength with food.
Tactical and physical training was conducted by the soldiers of the Bagucheon sentry post.
During the break, they would play cards together, and the losers would have to bend over, both for entertainment and physical exercise.
After a brief rest in the cold wind, they climbed to the patrol's target point and took a solemn oath with the national flag at the mouth of the mountain.
Behind them are snow-capped mountains, and in front of them are hundreds of miles of no man's land. They are the safest guardians of the country's gates.
Beijing Consumption Quarter Reopens - Official website
Beijing will re-launch the various activities of the Beijing Consumer Season in accordance with the principle of "overall re-launch, priority planning, orderly advancement and strict organization."
On July 26, 1.5 million government and business consumer coupons were issued, including one million underground food and beverage coupons and 500,000 smart product coupons.
Liu Meiying, deputy director of Beijing's Commerce Bureau, said at a press conference on the 25th that the reopening of the consumption season will further reduce the company's capital allocation on the basis of maintaining the existing discounted subsidy for consumer vouchers and packages.
Starting in early August, the current 1:1 ratio of government and business financing will be adjusted to 2:1. For example, if a consumer receives a card and goes to a store for consumption, he or she will be entitled to a 120-yuan discount, with a government subsidy of 60 yuan and a business profit of 60 yuan; after the adjustment, the government subsidy will be 80 yuan and the business profit will be 40 yuan.
During the consumption season, the three major carriers will subsidize traffic and terminals around 5G consumption, further promoting Beijing's new 5G infrastructure and new 5G consumption.
Hong Kong's economy hit again by outbreak of plague, Chen says - China News Agency
Hong Kong is facing a new wave of cholera outbreaks, which are hitting business and economic activity, the finance secretary of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) said on Sunday.
The HKSAR Government once again calls on small and medium-sized owners to reduce their rents and to work hard with retailers, restaurants and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
On the same day, Chen published an article on the Internet entitled "Rugged Road to Recovery".
He said the recent high number of confirmed cases of new coronary pneumonia in Hong Kong is a serious situation affecting the livelihoods of the community and the economy.
In the event of repeated outbreaks, the first priority is to prevent the importation of cases, deal with them as quickly as possible and interrupt the transmission chain. Economic activities should be resumed in a timely manner when the outbreaks are under control.
He pointed out that in the face of a new wave of epidemic shocks, business and economic activity, which had initially seen a slight recovery, were also hit.
In addition to the spirit of contract, social responsibility is equally important for the business community, especially for groups receiving large government subsidies under the Employment Insurance Scheme.
He said Hong Kong's economy remained severe in the second quarter of this year, but the contraction seemed to have slowed slightly.
In terms of exports, he said the situation on Hong Kong's periphery remained grim.
Mr Chan said the development of Hong Kong over the past decades has shown that every crisis hides new opportunities and every difficulty hides the keys to future development.

"The cost of services is rising," he said.
People are spending more time on the Internet because of the epidemic.
Marinichev does not rule out a sharp rise in Internet prices this year, arguing that operators can offset dissatisfaction with the rise in prices by offering customers higher speeds and more services.

It is understood that the first time on the day of the liberation of Wuhan, Bona Company overcame the difficulties, sent a team to deepen the epidemic situation, and with hundreds of health care workers face-to-face to exchange information and collect data. At present, we have interviewed including Zhong Nanshan himself, the first person in Guangzhou to help Wuhan, Guangdong medical team to help E, and Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital, Wuhan Co-operation Hospital, Wuhan University Central South Hospital, Wuhan Center Hospital and other frontline white-coated angels of the anti-epidemic front, and recorded a large number of precious first-hand video materials.
"I am very much looking forward to it, and I hope that you will not only visit some of the experts who have come forward, but also interview more of the medical personnel who have been working hard at the front line, and they are the majority of them," he said.
He says he's seen "Me and My Country" and "Chinese Captain" before and thinks it's a good way to tell a big-picture story from the perspective of ordinary people.
Now some foreign friends still have some misunderstandings about China.
Speaking about the spread of the film, Zhong Nanshan said that some people abroad now like to put the virus on political labels. He hoped the film would appeal to audiences from a humane point of view. "This film, besides being shown in China, would be best shown abroad.
"After so many years, the film that impressed me the most after the reform and opening-up was People to Middle Ages. At that time, doctors' friends from abroad were crying, and it would be great if Doctors of China could play such a role," he said.
"If Doctor Who can resonate with foreign audiences, it will be a great success," said Zhong Nanshan.
In the course of the exchange, Zhong Nanshan also shared his views and suggestions on the current international epidemic prevention and control. "I believe that people are always smarter than viruses.
According to Zhong Nanshan, although the virus is difficult to predict, from the primitive society to the present day, mankind has passed through many difficulties and dangers. Nowadays, modern society has developed medical technology and social management measures, plus medical personnel and even ordinary people all over the world have a basic understanding of the scientific response to the new coronary pneumonia epidemic, people will no longer be as passive as before.

Jiaxing Red Ship Mould, Shaoshan Mao Zedong bronze statue, Yan'an cloth pile flower crafts, Xiangxi Yongshun sausage ... July 25, 2020 Hunan Red Tourism Culture Festival opens in Shaoshan.
As one of the main activities, the first Xiangtan Red Cultural Industry Expo was held at the Shaoshan Tourism Advisory Distribution Center.
The exhibition area is full of red creative products, the revolutionary old area special products and so on, attracting tourists from all over the world to compete for purchases.
"The Red Expo is not only an exhibition of the achievements of the national red cultural industry, but also an important platform for exchanging experiences and exploring development paths between exhibiting units and enterprises," he said.
The theme of the first Hong Kong Expo was "Promoting Red Culture to Raise the Temperature of Literary Journeys," and the total area of the exhibition was nearly 3,000 square meters.
We invited 137 enterprises and units from 8 overseas provinces and cities such as Jiaxing, Guizhou, Zunyi, Yan'an, Shaanxi, Changsha, Zhuzhou, Yueyang, Chenzhou and so on to exhibit 768 kinds of exhibits, including red cultural relics, handicrafts, food specialties, tourism routes, red training courses, red creative products and so on.
The exhibition area will be open until 29 July.
As the host of the Red Expo, Xiangtan exhibition area bright spots.
The head of the exhibition area introduced that Xiangtan exhibition area is divided into red industry and red cultural industry.
The Red Industrial Exhibition Area displayed 31 exhibits from six Chinese enterprises, including Hualing Xiang Steel, Hualing Cable and Xiang Electric Power, while the Red Cultural Industry Development Exhibition Area displayed nearly 200 products from 27 units, including the Red Series of Books, the Red Series of Food, and the Red Series of Creative Products.
In Yan'an exhibition area, many visitors are attracted by the display of cloth pile handcrafts and paper cutting arts.

Sixty percent increase in telecommunications network fraud crime in the first half of the year - Xinhua News Agency
According to the website of the Supreme Prosecutor's Office, in the first half of this year, the country's prosecutors prosecuted a total of 58,101 people for fraudulent crimes, an increase of 35% year-on-year.
In particular, fraudulent offenses are frequently committed in the prevention and control of epidemic conditions, and the number of fraudulent offenses prosecuted by procuratorial organs accounts for 43.4% of the total number of crimes in the prevention and control of epidemic conditions.
The Supreme People's Prosecutor's Office has been carrying out targeted guidance, and nine of the ten batches of typical cases involving epidemic prevention and control that have been published so far involve crimes of fraud.
From the first half of the year, the number of cases handled by procuratorial organs involving fraudulent crimes ranged from macroeconomic policies of the state to ordinary people's clothing, food and lodging, including fraud involving epidemics, fraud involving "medical care", fraud involving "health care products", fraud involving "enrollment intermediaries", fraud involving "routing loans", fraud involving fraud involving state subsidies, fraud involving fraud involving the freezing of national assets, and so on.
In particular, some telecommunications network frauds break through national boundaries, geographical and personnel limitations, have the characteristics of involvement of the public, cross-border, remote, electronic payment, etc.
For example, some establish specialized companies, rent high-end office buildings, set up multiple departments or posts, use legitimate online platforms to advertise, recruit, train and evaluate recruiters, adopt business model management, dress in "legitimate clothes", and be more confusing.
It is the inalienable duty of procuratorial organs to punish and prevent crime in accordance with law, and to issue early warnings to the public and relevant departments in a timely manner.
In the administration of justice, procuratorial organs carry out their duties conscientiously, not only insisting on maintaining a high level of pressure on fraudulent crimes, but also targetedly fine-tuning various enforcement measures and promoting social governance through the issuance of procuratorial recommendations.
The procuratorial organs shall strictly examine the facts, evidence, procedures and application of the law in cases of arrest and prosecution of fraud, taking the facts as the basis and the law as the criterion, and do so in good faith.
Especially for the crime of telecommunication network fraud, we pay attention to the core role of electronic data in fact identification, and try to build the chain of evidence between electronic data, verbal evidence and written evidence.
In the case of an epidemic-related fraud case handled by the Yinzhou District Procuratorate of Ningbo City, Zhejiang Province, the procuratorial organ intervened early in the first place, from the case to the conclusion, taking only five days, demonstrating the attitude and determination to handle the case strictly and safeguard the stability of the social situation.
In the process of reviewing arrests and prosecutions, attention was paid to the prosecution of offenders who had omitted to report their cases, correcting 733 people who had omitted to report their cases to public security organs, and correcting 1,113 people who had omitted to report their cases to public security organs.
In the first half of the year, the national procuratorial organs issued 298 procuratorial recommendations against fraudulent crimes, promoting joint efforts to prevent fraudulent crimes and promote deep-level governance.
For example, the Guangzhou Procuratorate of Guangdong Province and the Dongguan City Procuratorate of Dongguan City of Guangdong Province, in response to the loopholes in the regulation of telecommunications networks found by telecommunications enterprises, banks and intermediary organizations, urge the relevant units to strengthen the regulation and improve the mechanisms to help promote the construction of an effective system.
Fourth, do your best to track down the stolen and damage the work.
The procuratorial organs at various places seize the important links of intervening in the investigation, guiding the taking of evidence, examining and prosecuting, urging the investigating organs to actively recover the stolen money, cooperating with the relevant departments to do a good job of recovering and damaging the stolen money, and striving to minimize the economic losses caused by fraudulent crimes to the people.
In the case of the Lin Road Loan case handled by the Beijing Public Prosecutor's Office, the case involved 22 sets of houses waiting to be sealed off.In the event that the houses might be dealt with beforehand in other cases, the first instituted the issuance of the Letter of Suspension of Enforcement, which was delivered to the relevant courts in a timely manner, recommending that the courts that had previously sealed off the houses concerned be delayed in enforcing them, pending the clarification of the facts of the crime and their unified disposition, so as to make the greatest efforts to recover the houses concerned and recover the losses of the victims.
The prosecutor reminded people to be very vigilant against fraudulent crimes, not to expect "the pie will fall in the sky", and not to believe in cheapness, and to keep their "money bag".
Lengna Town, Wenning County, Guizhou Province: Shortening the Apple Tree and Widening the Road to Poverty Alleviation - Zhongxin News Agency
| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |
A reporter from China Economic Daily - China Economic Network walks into Zhonghai Village in Yanna Town, Wenning County, Guizhou Province.
In the hot sun, the villager Li Yuanzhong hoes grass in the base, although his face is red, but he hums a few little songs from time to time in his mouth.
Because of its low latitude, high altitude, abundant sunlight and large difference in day and night temperatures, the apples produced contain high sugar content and good taste, and have a certain reputation in the surrounding area, but also because of the small head and many spots, it has not been able to sell a good price, and has not been able to form an industrial scale.
The town was once a poverty-stricken township known as "Baotani Yangimo De Chunqiu," where the incidence of poverty was as high as 25.8% 10 years ago.
It is imperative to change traditional cultivation habits, adjust the industrial structure and increase farmers' incomes during the critical period when the fight against poverty and hunger is firmly on the way to a decisive victory.
After several visits by Chen Chao and a group of people in the town, Yunnan Town Party Committee believes that the development of industry can no longer go the old way.
For this reason, Yanna town introduced the leading enterprises, grow apples in a modern way.
Hou Jianwen, deputy general manager of Weining Beyond Agriculture Co., Ltd., came to Yanna Town from Shaanxi in 2015 to investigate the local planting conditions at a glance, and began to grow apple trees there in 2016.
At first, the village mobilized Li Yuanzhong to turn the land around and plant apple trees. Li Yuanzhong and his wife began to wonder, "I have grown apples for so many years, and I have not seen anyone in the village grow apples to make money.
"All the apples that are grown are dwarf apples. They don't make the apple tree grow too tall.
To Li Yuanzhong's surprise, a new method of apple cultivation was adopted. Irrigation pipes were laid under each apple tree, water and fertilizer were poured into the roots, and when the fruit was harvested in the autumn, the tractor went directly into the orchard and could pick it standing.
At present, the apple base has gradually entered a booming period, and the market is also as expected by Hou Jianwen, apples do not worry about selling, and are loved by consumers in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and other cities.
The growing apple industry has brought new changes to Li Yuanzhong's life. Although he is still cultivating the land, he has a new source of income.
Every year, in addition to the guaranteed land transfer fee, there is a profit dividend after the fruit hanging, and the couple usually work at the base, "one person can get 80 yuan a day, and always have a job."
Li Yuanzhong told reporters that last year, the profit margin was more than 2,800 yuan, plus the land transfer fee and the husband and wife's worker's income, the family earned more than 80,000 yuan.
"At the moment, the first results have been seen, and the annual value of an acre of apples exceeds 150,000 yuan, about 10 times that of corn," he said.
Chen Chao told reporters that the entire town has planted 20,000 acres of apples, and there are 6,000 acres in Zhonghai Village alone, covering 4,056 farming households and 1,720,000 people, including 656 households and 2,952 people who are poor enough to build a business card, and pay more than 6 million yuan a year.
Li Yuanzhong, whose waistcoat is getting heavier and heavier, is also beginning to realize his "wishes".
"I still have a dozen acres of land at home, and when the next step is to expand the Apple base, all of it will be transferred to them, which will give them more income," he said.

Membrane separation technology helps crack the "greenhouse effect" - China News Agency
Membrane Separation Technology Helps to Defeat the "Greenhouse Effect"
Illustration of Preparation Technology of New Mixed Matrix Film
Tianjin University's Atmospheric Environment and Bioenergy Team has made significant progress in the field of membrane separation for capturing carbon dioxide, and has successfully developed a new mixed matrix membrane preparation technology that greatly improves the capturing capability of carbon dioxide in membrane materials.
The results have been published on the cover of the international journal Greenhouse Gases: Science and Technology.
The "greenhouse effect" is a major environmental problem that plagues human development, and carbon dioxide emissions are the culprits of the "greenhouse effect".
How to efficiently capture and use carbon dioxide from human emissions is the focus of scientists' attention.
"Membrane separation" is an emerging technology of carbon dioxide capture. It separates carbon dioxide gas with the help of membrane materials, and has the characteristics of efficient energy saving and simple operation.
The bottleneck of capturing carbon dioxide by membrane separation is how to let the membrane material breathe deeply and improve the gas separation efficiency.
The research team of Tianjin University explored the influence of different solvents on membrane gas separation properties through repeated experiments.
Experimental results show that N-methylpyrrolactone as a solvent produces a more even distribution of carbon nanotubes in the membrane material and "more permeable", which effectively improves the gas separation efficiency and rate of the membrane material.
The carbon dioxide separation properties of mixed matrix membranes prepared with this new technology are close to the theoretical separation limits of such membrane materials.
"The new technology provides a new way of capturing carbon dioxide by membrane separation," he said.
Li Lun, a member of Tianjin University's Atmospheric Environment and Bioenergy team, said: "We hope this technology will provide strong support for future coal-fired power plants and chemical companies to handle flue gas and play a major role in controlling greenhouse gas emissions.
Find out what is the professional grade difference before filling out the volunteer form-CNN
Chongqing Morning Post | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |
Before filling out the form, get to know what is the professional grade difference
Every year, students or parents who do not know the noun involved in the application of the entrance examination volunteer, and thus affect the application of the volunteer.
This year, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing University of Science and Technology, Beijing Postal and Telecommunication University, Beijing Forestry University, and Beijing Chemical University jointly issued admission policies for 2020, eliminating the difference in professional grades.
What does professional grade difference mean and what is its significance in volunteering?
There are three types of professional allocation rules
Experts reminded that before filling out the application form, you must read carefully the Admission Regulations of the College of Hearts and Minds, and understand the admission rules of universities, including filing ratio, specialty allocation rules, etc.
The specialty allocation rule refers to the three ways of specialty priority, grade priority and grade difference for specialty admission after university filing.
Which method is used by the universities will be specified in the Admissions Regulations.
However, there are some universities admission principle is the total priority, there is no grade difference between majors.
If the student fails to reach the 1st Professional Volunteer Admission Point Line, he/she will be considered to have reached the 2nd Professional Volunteer Admission Point Line, and so on until he/she is admitted to the last Professional Volunteer, with no grade differences between the different Professional Volunteers.
In order to determine the admission of volunteer candidates in different specialties, the institutions, when arranging candidates' specialties, according to one or more points published in the admission regulations, such points are called "specialty grade difference".
This is the difference in grades between the first and non-first professional volunteers, and the difference in grades between the first and non-first professional volunteers, such as 3, 2, 1, and so on.
For example.
Assume that the student Xiao Ming registered for A universities, took 560 marks, their professional volunteers are: computer, international trade, automation, mechanical engineering, e-commerce, A university's professional admission practices the method of professional grade difference, the grade difference is divided into 2 points, 1 point, 1 point, 0 points.
If he fails, his score will be reduced by 2 points, and he will be ranked according to his score of 558 points with the candidates who have applied for International Trade in the first major.If he fails, his score will be reduced by 1 point (i.e., 557 points) for the "automated" admission of the third major.If he fails, his score will be reduced by 1 point (i.e., 556 points) for the admission of the fourth major.If he fails, his score will be reduced by 1 point (i.e., 556 points) for the admission of the fourth major.
Different colleges and universities have different degree levels
With the popularization of parallel volunteering, many universities have now abolished the professional grade difference, but this year, some universities still retain this method, according to the Admissions Regulations issued by the universities, more than 20 universities have set the professional grade difference this year.
For example, Sichuan Agricultural University, Shandong University of Science and Technology, Heilongjiang University of Chinese Medicine, Jiangsu University of Science and Technology, Jiangxi Normal University, Chengdu Medical College, Northeast Electric Power University, Jimei University, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing Industrial University, Ningxia University, Shandong University of Science and Technology, China Civil Aviation Flight Academy, etc.
In these universities, each university sets a different professional grade difference.
Some universities have grading differences for each major, such as Ningxia University, where the files have been submitted to the candidates, according to the order of the candidates volunteering for the major, decreasing one point after another in order of admission scores.
Some universities have different degrees for different subjects.
For example, at the University of Chicago, there is a four-point difference in the overall grade of the Professional Volunteer, i.e., a three-point difference between the First Professional Volunteer and the other Professional Volunteers, no grade difference between the other Professional Volunteers, and a one-point difference between the other Professional Volunteers and the Adjustment Professional Volunteers.
When filling out the application, candidates and parents must carefully read the admission policy of the reported schools, see if there are any specialty grade differences, the form of grade differences, while fully considering the scores, also have a reasonable analysis of the proposed school and specialty. If the institutions in the admission regulations clearly adopt a grade difference in the way of admission, candidates should pay attention to the gradient between the various specialties when choosing a specialty, to increase the admission rate.

"Belgium's three-year-old girl dies of new crown virus infection".
A three-year-old girl died of a new-crown virus infection, the youngest new-crown death in the country, the Belgian health ministry said on Thursday.
A Belgian health ministry spokesman, Boudewijn Cartery, said the girl had other serious illnesses before she contracted the virus; in addition to the girl, an 18-year-old had recently died of the virus.
Last week, 85 per cent of the new coronary surgeons in Belgium were under the age of 60, Cartery said.
He cautioned healthy, younger people not to lose heart.
“While young people are less likely to die from new crown-virus infections, no one is immune today.”
Last week, the number of new confirmed cases in Belgium rose 89% from the previous week, with an average of 2.9 deaths per day from new coronavirus infections, up from 1.7 per day the previous week.
During the peak of the epidemic in Europe, the proportion of the Belgian population infected with the new crown virus was “at the top of the list” in Europe.
Belgium has a population of more than 11 million.
The latest figures show that a total of 64847 people in Belgium have been infected with the new crown virus.
Mr. Carter warned earlier this week that action must be taken before the snowballs roll larger and larger and eventually cause avalanches.
To curb the resurgence of the epidemic, Belgian Prime Minister Sophie Wilms announced on 23 August that restrictions on wearing masks in public places would be tightened and that further lifting of the restrictions would be suspended in August.

All APEC member economies should act together to fight the epidemic, promote economic recovery and avoid the creation of unnecessary trade barriers in accordance with their rights and obligations under the World Trade Organization, the Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government, Mr. Qiu Danghua, said on July 25, Xinhua.
Mr. Qiu made the statement as he attended a videoconference of trade ministers at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) meeting on 25 September to combat the new crown disease epidemic.
At the meeting, ministers exchanged views on substantive programmes to be undertaken by APEC in response to the impact of the new cholera epidemic and to promote economic recovery in the region.
Mr. Qiu said the public health and economic crisis triggered by the outbreak had unprecedented far-reaching social and economic consequences.
"We are in a double battle, and we must overcome the epidemic before we can save the economy.
We need to have a clear goal. The virus is our common enemy. Cooperation is the only way to win, and failure is the only way to lose.
Qiu said a series of trade restrictions triggered by the pneumonia outbreak did not help control the outbreak.
Trade is the key to solving the current problems and should not be seen as the problem.
He condemned all policies and measures of discrimination and differentiation and urged all economies to keep their borders open at this critical juncture, to maintain the smooth functioning of supply chains and to avoid the creation of trade barriers or the adoption of irrational trade policies.

Chengdu crowds around American consulate, police stop people "looking too happy"
In response to the U.S. closure of China's consulate in Houston, China announced Friday the closure of the U.S. consulate in Chengdu.
On Saturday, the badge of the U.S. consulate was removed, and on Sunday, a dark-glass car drove away from the consulate amid the screams of passers-by.
On Sunday, many people in Chengdu piled up in front of the U.S. consulate to take photos, and those who had not come to see them were driven by curiosity about the current situation.
AFP Chengdu station reporters also visited the Chengdu American Consulate nearby to observe, relaying news that the curiosity is endless, and many parents with children to walk to the consulate, take photos of the building, or take selfies.
The consulate was surrounded by guards who, from time to time, "corrected" people's behavior and seemed to prevent any outbursts: a woman who had just begun singing the song was stopped, and a guard confiscated a banner.
But residents of a nearby residential building succeeded in raising a giant Chinese flag on their balcony and shouting slogans in support of China.
The U.S. Consulate in Chengdu was opened in 1985 and covers all U.S. consular-related matters in southwestern China, particularly in the Tibet Autonomous Region.
The Chinese government's response to the U.S. has been relatively restrained, with many Chinese online demanding the closure of the U.S. consulate in Hong Kong, but officials saying "the closure of the U.S. consulate in Chengdu is a necessary and legitimate response to the U.S.'s unreasonable behavior," AFP's Chengdu station correspondent said.

"Currently, there is a large-scale media campaign aimed at lifting people out of poverty. - Today's News - Hunan Daily News - China Voice Online".
On July 25, two tent cars carrying the 5G new media mobile cloud broadcasting system set off from Xuzhou, Jiangsu province, for the large-scale media-sharing operation "Go Village Live to Watch the Eradication of Poverty" sponsored by the Central Broadcasting and Television Corporation's Financial Program Center.
The President said, "2020 will be a landmark year, and we will achieve economic growth and development, achieve the first hundred-year goal, and 2020 will also be the year of decisive victory in the fight to eradicate poverty."
The large-scale media bridging campaign "Going to villages to see poverty alleviation live" is an important initiative of the Central Radio and Television Broadcasting Corporation's Financial Program Center to coordinate with this major theme and do a good job of fighting poverty alleviation.
The campaign will go into the poverty-reduction villages of more than 20 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities directly under the Central Government, digging up lively stories of poverty-reduction, directly hitting the villages with huge changes in their appearance, and show the villagers how to break through the difficulties of survival and development, and on the way to becoming rich.
The operation will last for more than three months.
From Xuzhou, the reporter divided his troops into two routes, one along the Southwest Line, passing through Anhui, Hubei, Jiangxi, Hunan, Guangxi, Guizhou, Sichuan, Chongqing, Yunnan, Tibet, etc., and the other along the Northwest Line, passing through Henan, Shaanxi, Gansu, Qinghai, Xinjiang, Ningxia, Inner Mongolia, Shanxi, Hebei, etc., traveling more than 10,000 kilometers.
In the form of reporting, "go village live to see poverty alleviation" boldly integrated.
The economic development of the caravans to the villages will be broadcast through CCTV Financial Channel, Central Broadcasting Corporation, China Communications Broadcasting Corporation, CCTV Financial New Media.
