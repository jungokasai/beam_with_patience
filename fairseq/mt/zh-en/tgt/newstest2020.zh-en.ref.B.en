The Confucius Institute of the Royal Cambodian Academy of Sciences has unveiled its "China in My Heart" Chinese essay competition
The Chinese essay competition "China in My Heart," themed on the 70th anniversary of new China, was unveiled and awarded at the Confucius Institute of the Royal Cambodian Academy of Sciences on June 26.
Zhong Jifa, a diplomat from the Chinese Embassy in Cambodia, Wei Siyu, a representative of the Cambodian-Chinese Council and the President of the Jiangxi Chamber of Commerce in Cambodia, presented awards to the honored guests.
According to Chai Keqing, the Chinese dean of the Confucius Institute at the Royal Cambodian Academy of Sciences, the competition has lasted two months. Participants include Cambodian students from junior, middle school (including specialized schools) and universities (including social personnel).
Diplomat Zhong Jifa of the Chinese Embassy in Cambodia presented certificates to Lin Weicai, the first prize winner of the university group, and Guo Lina, the first prize winner of the primary and secondary school group.
Chai Keqing said that the entries were organized separately by the university group and the primary and secondary school group. Senior Cambodian-Chinese experts were invited to form an evaluation panel. Through the initial evaluation, re-evaluation, final evaluation and other steps, the university group has finally picked out one first-prize winner, two second-prize winners, three third-prize winners, and ten excellent prize winners.

As announced by the International Atomic Energy Agency（IAEA）on 26th, Iran has started using the advanced centrifuge to accelerate the production of enriched uranium, which further violates the nuclear agreement that has been reached with the great power in the world in 2015.
As reported by the foreign media, IAEA announced that the advanced centrifuge of the Iranian Natanz Nuclear Facility “is accumulating or ready to accumulate the enriched uranium”.
Since the US President Trump withdrew from the nuclear agreement and imposed sanctions on Iran in May last year, Iran has been gradually violating the nuclear agreement reached with the world power in 2015.
The agreement regulates that Iran can only use the type IR-1 centrifuge of first generation to extract uranium.
Other signatory countries of this agreement including the UK, China, France, Germany and Russia were trying to remedy it. Yet Europe has been censured repeatedly by Teheran for not doing enough.
On the 25th local time, Japanese Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi held a discussion with his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov at the United Nations headquarters New York City on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly. The talk was about pushing forward the signing of a peace treaty between the two countries regarding issues including the ownership over the Northern Territories, called the Southern Kuril Islands in Russia, strengthening political and economic ties and reaching an agreement on Motegi's future visit to Russia, according to a Japanese news agency Kyodo News.
This is Motegi's first discussion with Russia as the top negotiator in the signing of the peace treaty after he was appointed as Japan's foreign minister.
Motegi said that "I would like to hold a discussion regarding issues including promoting the economic activities in the Northern Territories with Russia as soon as possible."
According to the Japanese government, both sides did not go into detail about the territory issue.
The foreign ministers of the two countries developed a plan to be in charge of accelerating the negotiation at the Japan-Russia Foreign Ministers’ Meeting in December 2018.
At the meeting, the two foreign ministers welcomed the progress made in the negotiation on mutual economic activities in tourism and refuse disposal.
When talking about the trial businesses in the tourism industry in October, Motegi said that “I hope that they could be successful and contribute to our next step.”
On top of that, they also confirmed the date for Lavrov to visit Japan during the G20 Foreign Ministers’ Meeting held in Nagoya in November.

Women's volleyball team might successfully defend World Cup championship in advance!
In the match between China and the Netherlands on the 27th, China lost the last set after winning the first two, defeating the Netherlands 3-1 for their ninth consecutive win.
As the World Cup is approaching its end, China's women's volleyball team still need to stay alert in front of the Serbian team, though they are so close to their goal of defending the championship.
In the first two sets, China kept an advantage over the Netherlands with strong performance as usual, establishing its 25-19 and 26-16 victory. But the team struggled in the third set.
Despite the disadvantages, the Netherlands rallied back with aggressive serves, creating huge pressure on China's first pass. The Chinese ladies were anxious to attack, leading to more errors and ultimately losing 21-25.
After the match, Lang Ping pointed out in the interview, "We lost about 8 points because of our errors in the third set."
Of course, one should never underestimate the Netherlands women's volleyball team. China's team was prepared for a tough game. Everything was under Lang Ping's control despite their defeat in one set. "When you play against a strong team, it is perfectly normal to win, to lose, or end up with a five-set match, so I told my team to concentrate," said Lang Ping.
In the fourth set, the players adjusted their conditions effectively. Zhang Changning on her full attacking power scored 8 points in one single set, making a huge contribution to China's victory.
As of now, there are only two rounds of matches remaining from the initial eleven rounds. China is almost grabbing the championship, but the match against the Netherlands did serve as a reminder: the closer they get to the critical moment, the more they need to make every effort.
In another match on the 27th, Russia and USA had a full five-set game. As USA did not manage to win all the three points, there is a chance that China can defend the champion if it could win all the three points in the match against Serbia.
Everything seems to be moving to the direction to China's advantage.
However, Serbia will not give the three points to China that easily, though the six leading Serbian players are all absent this time.
Given the current ranking, it is unlikely that Serbia will get any medal, which means they can go to the game against China with "light packs" and challenge their opponents without any burden, whereas China’s anxiety to win the game might lead to performance inconsistencies.
Moreover, the Serbian substitutes are not to be slaughtered like sacrificial lambs. They fought against the Netherlands line-up of their main players in five sets and reversed the latter's advantage with a 3-2 victory, which certainly says something about their capabilities.
Before the start of the third stage of the tournament, Lang Ping anticipated that her team could have a hard time with the Netherlands and Serbia, "The game in Osaka will be very tough, but we will prepare for it as much as we can, as we always do. "
Now the horn for defending the championship has been sounded, and the game is reaching its climax.
China is stronger than its opponent in terms of ability and the line-up, but the result will depend on whether the ladies can stay calm in the critical, final moment and release all their power on the court.

When delivering a speech at the West Point Military Academy in the US, Stoltenberg said that “For 70 years, the containment and defensive measures that North Atlantic Treaty Organization have taken were all based on the maintenance of the technological superiority”.
He said, but this is an era of change.
Stoltenberg said: “The competitions we encounter will be increasingly fierce.
Therefore, we should make much more efforts to prevent others from surpassing us.”
He said: “Some technologies were developed by the authoritarian states rather than the member states of NATO.
The companies in China are developing the 5th generation networks.
Russia is developing the independent internet and investing heavily in the development of the next generation of weapons, such as the hypersonic missile.
Stoltenberg said, the future safety of NATO “depends on its ability to understand, accept and apply the cutting-edge technologies”.
The love outreach for helping the disable, “a steamer ticket takes me to have a look”, was held at the Orange Island in Changsha on September 24. Over 100 disabled people were invited to cruise “The Star of Juzhou” to enjoy the magnificent scenery of Xiang River and celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of New China together.
It was the first time for most of the disabled people who joined this activity to go on a cruise.
Zhao Zhengang, who was 56-year-old, is physically disabled. He rarely goes out due to the difficulty in moving.
He said: “Today is my first time to go on a cruise. I am excited about enjoying the magnificent scenery of Xiang River at a short distance and feeling the development of Changsha. It is difficult to forget. “
The volunteers from Fukang Social Service Center in Changsha and Blue Sky Rescue provided meticulous services for the disable.
Especially for those with serious physical disability, volunteers would carry them on the back to go on and off the cruise.
The relevant person in charge at Fukang Social Service Center said, in the past 70 years, the services for the disable in Changsha have kept developing and improving with the support of the Party and Government. More and more disabled people are really becoming the participants, contributors and beneficiaries of the development of social economics. Caring about the disable and services for the disable is also gradually becoming a social consensus.
As the Republic is about to celebrate its 70th anniversary, the flashing spotlights of all kinds of media have refreshed our memories of numerous character images that don't often come to our minds and made them glitter with brilliance again-- it is they, in their days of shining upon us, who bring in the heat and light little by little.
However, a hero walking on the side seems nothing other than an ordinary person like you and me.
Yuan Longping, who has devoted himself to rice research and bred elite varieties that can be used in farming all over the world, makes remarkable contributions so that more than one billion Chinese people would no longer have to fear going hungry, and this old man usually looks like an old farmer who likes to wander in the fields. Nan Rendong, the chief scientist who has taken his great care to put China's "Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope" into service, only did one thing in his whole life. With one man and a cooking pot, he ate cold steamed buns in the deep Guizhou mountains, no different from an old man in the countryside. Zhou Ruchang, the redologist was a village boy who started learning very late, still looks like a child when he is old, and has a thorough knowledge of both western and traditional Chinese culture. With shaggy white hair, he likes to burst into a roar of laughter when his heart is stricken by the academic communication. Qin Yi, a heavyweight film artist, still spends six or seven hours bumping on the plateau every day for rehearsal when she is past 90, she was even willing to play as an unknown old maid in Legend of the Demon Cat.
They, living their own ways, hold a simple, reclusive and unswerving attitude toward life. As long as they are immersed in their favorite undertakings which are elusive to the outsiders but invaluable in their own eyes, they will feel easy to be happy, living in ignorance of social rankings, honors, wealth and interests.
Just like the ground-sweeping monk in the Sutras pavilion of Shaolin Temple as described in Jin Yong's novel, although he has stunning skills in martial art that can shock the world, he is neither pretentious nor haughty, neither happy nor sad.
As for every "ground-sweeping monk" and every single one of the childlike at heart, there lies the commitments to the call of duty that who but myself can do it.
The responsibility of family-country rests not only on the shoulders of heroes but also in the hands of millions of people.
Once, a female middle school student's words went viral on the web: "When the hero passes by, there always are people who have to sit on the roadside to applaud... I don't want to be a hero. I want to be the one sitting on the roadside applauding."
Actually, being a hero and applauding a hero are not in conflicts.
People applauding on the roadside can also deliver their heat and light, and they are also luminous bodies themselves.
Ordinary like you and me, there are always in life some opportunities, some moments and sort of accumulations through long years, which also shape the appearance of heroes.
Zou Bihua, an excellent judge in Shanghai who shouldered the responsibility of carrying out judicial reforms, asked an old clerk from the reception room to tell his own story in public at an annual meeting about how newspapers and letters were delivered and received throughout the year without any mistake. "To do simple things well is not simple." Zou Bihua led the judges in applauding the old clerk--- the likes of "ground-sweeping monk."
It's the appreciations from heroes, one hero is paying tribute to another.
The group-sweeping monk had his Sutra Depository of the Shaolin Temple, Yuan Longping had a vast experimental rice field, Nan Rendong has the "Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope", Qin Yi has a stage, and Zhou Ruchang has a pulpit. Whether you can be a hero depends not only on your own efforts, but also on a good environment and a positive incentive mechanism.
China's "Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope", for example, is now a legend.
In the 1990s, China's scientific community was still struggling, and novelist Liu Cixin had yet to write the Three-Body Problem.
At that time, the most powerful "eye" was Arecibo, a single-aperture radio telescope in the valley of Puerto Rico, which was 350 meters in diameter and was considered to be the world's largest "that couldn't be surpassed."
At that time, China's radio telescope was less than one tenth of its diameter.
Nan Rendong, who was treated with the world-class research facilities and salaries in Japan, insisted on returning to China with his crazy idea: to build a new generation of radio "big telescope" in China to receive more information from outer space!
However, there were many things waiting to be done in China at that time; could it be that a heavy investment of money is poured in only for playing with the stars?
The motherland had confidence in Nan Rendong, and the "Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope" project was launched.
It took 12 years to find the right location and another 9 years to complete the project.
With the 500-meter caliber "Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope," China has completed "the world's exclusive great scientific project" with no precedent to follow.
Therefore, the "Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope" is great, the likes of Nan Rendong are great, tolerance brings respect, the republic is great by looking far and aiming high,
With the country's confidence and goodwill of its people, the likes of Nan Rendong have the opportunity to turn into the soul of the country and the courage of the people.
With youngsters of outstanding capabilities and heroes of grey hairs peacefully walking by and people clapping softly along the streets, a wonderful and harmonious life is promising in such a land.
Garbage classification education was introduced into Jilin kindergartens for the first time
On the 27th, a kindergarten at Jilin city in Jilin province has conducted a garbage classification education class, teaching young children to distinguish between the recyclables and other kinds of garbage.
It is reported that this is the first time that garbage classification was introduced into local educational classes for young children.
A few days ago nine departments of Jilin province have jointly issued the "Working Plan for Promoting the Classification and Disposal of Household Garbage at the Prefecture-Level Cities in Jilin Province."
Based on the pilot project of compulsory classification of household waste in Changchun in 2019, the province has decided to carry out the household waste classification in prefecture-level cities.
Jilin City is one of them.
"We hope through such an activity to realize the effect of young children driving the family and the kindergarten driving the society and advocate the concept of environmental protection,"
said Liu Lijuan, the executive director of Hifaner International Kindergarten where the event was held.
On that day, the head of the kindergarten read out the environmental protection proposal, hoping that garbage classification starts from children.
After the "Low Carbon Babe" dance performance, the children were grouped up to play the garbage sorting games.
The instructor also issued “recyclable” and “other garbage” labels, suggesting that the children stick these labels to the trash containers and record a short video clip when they return home.
Liu Lijuan noted that the kindergarten has kept advocating the concept of low-carbon, green and environmental protection, and opened up regular environmental classes.
Trash cans marked with containable types are also placed at the garbage dumps in the kindergarten.

According to preliminary statistics, the amount of urban household waste generated in Jilin Province in 2018 was around 5,465,200 tons, all of which were sent to household waste disposal sites for treatment.
Among them, 329,200 tons were treated by sanitary landfills, 2.0923 million tons by burning, and 80,100 tons by comprehensive utilization process.
Through years of hard work, every city and county in the province is able to conduct hazard-free treatment for household wastes.
According to the "Working Plan for Promoting the Classification and Disposal of Household Garbage at the Prefecture-Level Cities in Jilin Province” which has been issued, it is clearly required to deepen the works and carry out extensive activities such as bringing garbage classification education going into campus, textbooks and classrooms, strengthen the interactions between students and parents by creating the garbage classification songs, rhymes, comics and short videos, and achieve the effect of "teaching a child, influencing a family, driving a community, and cultivating a new generation."
Figures released on 27 September by Mazda showed that in August, the company sold 117,015 vehicles worldwide.
Sales in China dropped by 21 per cent due to reasons such as a shortage of new vehicles on the market and less reduction in price.
Domestic sales in Japan dropped by 6 per cent. The demand was still limited even before the rise in the consumption tax when people were busy seizing the last chance to purchase vehicles.
Mazda sold 17,729 vehicles in China in August.
Sales have been going down. They were 13 per cent lower in August 2018 than in the same period last year.
The China-exclusive CX-4 SUV also witnessed a fall in sales by 14 per cent.
It has been a long time since CX-4 was launched in 2016. It was no longer a new model.
In the long run, the strategy of providing less reduction in price will reinforce brand values. However, it also had significant impacts on sales.
Mazda sold 27,482 vehicles in the United States with a 7 per cent increase in sales. It has been 14 months since last time its sales grew.
An extra business day in August and Mazda's sales promotion led to a sales growth of vehicles such as CX-5 SUV.
Japan's domestic sales dropped by 6 per cent with only 14,422 vehicles were sold.
The company said that "not as many vehicles were sold as the last time (in 2014)" before the rise in the consumption tax.
Compact cars such as Demio also witnessed a decline in sales.
Chirac's political legacy lives long after he passed away
On the 26th local time, the former President of France Mr. Chirac suddenly passed away at the age of 86.
As the world is changing in a way unseen in a hundred years, the political legacies left by the French politician when he was in power are still worthy of our thumbs-up.
With his very personalized charismatic leadership, Chirac had been France's President for as long as 12 years.
Inheriting the independent diplomatic spirit of Gaullism and standing firm with the European integration, he was the representative personality in pursuit of the "European Dream."
At the same time he was also a strong advocate of the global multi-polarization and multilateralism, a politician with strategic vision.
For this reason, the French media hailed him as "France's outstanding representative in the international arena."
One of Mr. Chirac's memorable political decisions was his opposition of the US-led war in Iraq.
Led by him, France worked together with Germany to stand up to American pressure and took the lead in fighting against the war.
One year after the war broke out, he predicted that the war in Iraq would lead to increased terrorist activities and make the world more dangerous.
Mr. Chirac's warning turned out to be right.
At a time when European integration is going astray and American unilateralism is increasingly rising, Mr. Chirac's strategic thinking and choices in international politics and global affairs are undoubtedly of enlightening significance while we compare the past with the present.
Mr. Chirac was also a French politician who made Chinese people feel quite familiar and friendly.
He was one of the advocates and creators for the "Golden Decade" of Sino-France relations. After he was first elected as the President of France in 1995, he had been promoting the rapid development of Sino-France relations with a politicians' strategic vision.
In 2004, China and France established a comprehensive strategic partnership, ushering in a new stage of bilateral exchanges.
During Mr. Chirac's administration, Sino-France's bilateral trade volume grew rapidly, and cooperations in aviation, nuclear energy and railway transportation made breakthroughs.
The Sino-France Culture Year initiated by Mr. Chirac created a new mode of cultural exchange in the history of two countries.
Chirac's lifelong obsession with Chinese culture was particularly impressive.
According to Chinese diplomats who knew about him, he was able to recite some poems by Li Bai and Du Fu, and even accurately date Chinese bronze wares.
"You've not really been to Egypt without seeing the Pyramids, and not really been to China without seeing the Terracotta Army" -- it was Mr Chirac who said this golden phrase.
"The West is concerned about China's political and social development, the ecological problems arising from China's economic growth as well as China's political position in the world," Mr. Chirac said in an interview with Xinhua.
"But I have faith in China.
I think with a long history of civilization, China has enough experience of helping itself build and implement the visions and values of harmonious development to shoulder its responsibilities on the world stage for a long time."
I also believe that China's revitalization will release new creative vitality to global civilization and enrich the world's cultures.
Although he has passed away, Mr Chirac's political legacies and enlightenments to the world will live forever.

Legislative Council of Hong Kong pro-establishment politicians issued a joint statement to oppose the Hong Kong-related Act passed by USA
Several pro-establishment politicians in the Legislative Council of Hong Kong issued a joint statement on the 27th to denounce the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act 2019 passed by US House Committee on Foreign Affairs.
This statement, jointly signed by 40 pro-establishment politicians, says that the current rights of Hong Kong are conferred by the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, including the rights to maintain Hong Kong's status as a free-trade port and separate customs territory, and to trade, cooperate, develop relationships, and sign and implement bilateral and multilateral agreements in various fields such as economics, finance, shipping, trade, communications, tourism, culture, sports, etc. with other countries and regions around the world in the name of “Hong Kong, China.”
These rights are not granted by any foreign government or legislature.
Hong Kong has been strictly observing international agreements, international rules, laws, and business ethics. Hong Kong is well-known for its great achievements in its trade with different countries and regions and its collaborations in many related fields.
The statement says the approval of the Act by US House Committee on Foreign Affairs is unnecessary. It is nothing but a response to the call of the gang of their delegates in Hong Kong and represents blatant interference in Hong Kong's domestic affairs that helps those delegates in their political bargains.
The pro-establishment politicians expressed their deep disappointments and strong disapproval of this move of the US Congress.
The statement points out that Hong Kong is an important trading partner of the United States and the largest source of trade surplus.
Hong Kong has become a good option for American businessmen because of its excellent rule of law, its fair and free business environment, and its incorruptible society.
If the US Congress passes this Act, it will only hurt the interests of Hong Kong and the United States and worsen the China-US relations, which means it will do nothing good to itself or others.
The statement points out that Hong Kong will, as always, unswervingly implement the "One country, Two systems" policy, and continue to enjoy its rights conferred by the Basic Law and to perform its delegated duties effectively.
Just as in the past, Hong Kong is making its contributions to the international community and international business and will continue to do so in the future.
French national parliament is going to discuss the reform of the immigration policy next week, according to Nouvelles D'Europe on the 26th.
French President Emmanuel Macron stated that France cannot "host everyone", but is trying to "host people well" at the same time.
Macron has been trying to take the middle way regarding the immigration issue in order to reduce the tension in the coming debate, according to the report.
Macron said in an interview from the United Nations in New York where he is attending the annual General Assembly that about the immigration policy, he wanted to find a way to kill two birds with one stone and also find a balance between providing humanitarian aid and being efficient.
"France cannot host everyone (of the immigrants) if it wants to host people well", according to Macron.
Macron highlighted four key points of the immigration policy: giving rights to refugees who need protection, helping immigrants fit in more efficiently, accepting and protecting all immigrants who entered France and relocating people who entered France illegally and are not suitable to stay.
Whether or not illegal immigrants should be protected by the State Medical Aid (in French: “Aide Médicale d’Etat”, AME) has been discussed a lot recently.
Macron hopes that the AME system could be assessed and be restricted instead of being abolished.
Leader of France’s far-right Front National (FN) Marine Le Pen tweeted that Macron was just saying empty words after Macron made the announcement.
Gérard Larche, Member of the Les Républicains party and president of the Senate of France, also criticized Macron by saying that he should relax the tension and face reality at the same time when talking about the immigration policy.
Member of the Parti socialiste Boris Vallaud believes that France should "host more and host better" when it comes to the immigration issue. He also criticized Macron for not being serious about this issue.
According to the report, the new Immigration and Asylum Law not only caused the interior disagreement in the ruling party but also had no positive impact on the right opposition party in the year after it was issued.
In the 2020 presidential campaign, the immigration issue will once again become the target for the far-right. Macron has to make some progress in this issue, but is very likely to infuriate the left wing in the Republique en Marche.
According to the report, France's national parliament Assemblée nationale is going have a debate about the immigration issue on September 30th and the debate of the Senate of France will be held on October 2nd.
China's A-share shows a "repurchase wave" as several listed companies repurchase companies' stocks with cash.
According to a financial data service provider East Money, as of the 27th, the total amount of the repurchase of A-share listed companies in 2019 has exceeded 100 billion Chinese yuan, far more than the amount in the same period of previous years, hitting a record high for the amount of A-share repurchase capital.
Xu Yang, Chairman of Shanghai Macro Information Consulting Co, said that the overall valuation of the A-share market is relatively low this year. Repurchasing stocks at a relatively low price is conducive to improving the efficiency of capital use of listed companies. It reflects the willingness of listed companies to actively manage their market value, shows their sufficient cash flow conditions and therefore boosts investors' confidence.
In addition, improving the share repurchase system can also encourage listed companies to actively carry out share repurchases.
For example, at the beginning of this year, the Detailed Rules for the Repurchase of Shares by Listed Companies issued by the Shanghai Stock Exchange and Shenzhen Stock Exchange provided detailed rules and guides for listed companies to repurchase shares.
According to statistics, listed companies that have implemented share repurchase plans this year are mainly in the infrastructure, the real estate, the information technology and the electronic equipment manufacturing industry.
In addition, regarding the repurchase payment amount, there are six listed companies whose repurchase amount exceeded one billion yuan this year.
Among all of them, Yili was ranked first, with a repurchase amount of more than five billion yuan.
What impact will the repurchase of shares have on the market?
Zhao Xijun, deputy director of the School of Finance of Renmin University of China said in an interview with the China News Service that the repurchase shows that the listed company has strong economic power and good financial status so that it has the ability to maintain the stability of the stock price and give investors confidence. It also shows that listed companies and their shareholders are being responsible for the companies, the market and the investors.
The former is based on the company's good operating performance, while the latter requires listed companies and their controlling shareholders to have a higher quality.
For the capital market, this is the core basic element.
The repurchase of stocks by listed companies is beneficial to boost investors' confidence and support the stock price.
It is estimated by East Money that based on the estimated number of stocks being purchased set by the A-share listed companies since the beginning of this year and the average transaction price of the stocks repurchased, the incremental capital brought by the stock repurchase to the A-share market this year is expected to exceed 150 billion yuan.
Tianjin Tianhou Temple, a major historic and cultural site under state protection, just completed the restoration of a large piece of mural, Sketches of Mazu, who is also known as Mother Ancestor or Empress of Heaven in China, on September 26th. The restoration took almost two months and the mural will be reopened to visitors during China's National Day holiday.
The Sketches of Mazu is a series of mural telling the story of Mazu.
With the authorization from the government, the mural was painted by Cai Changkui, former curator of the Museum of Folk Customs of Tianjin(the Tianhou Temple) from 1991 to 1994.
The mural was painted on the north and south palace wall of the Tianhou Temple's main hall. It is 32 meters long and 2.6 meters high and is divided into two parts. It uses 358 characters to tell about Mazu's life with more than 30 stories, including how she was born, how she saved people on the sea and how she ascended to heaven and became an immortal.
Cai Changkui introduced that summers in Tianjin have been wet while winters have been dry in recent years. This led to cracks in the mural. 60 percent of the mural area was covered by cracks.
In order to protect and save the mural telling stories of Mazu, Ancient Cultural Street Committee of Nankai District, Tianjin, and the Tianhou Temple carried out the restoration work of the main hall of the Tianhou Temple and the mural inside of it.
The restoration work was led by Cai Changkui, together with four traditional Chinese painters.
The principle was to restore the mural to its original state instead of turning it into a new. Additionally, experts adjusted some of the contents and improved the imperfect parts of the mural.
During the restoration, we also had some innovation and attempts in the color, materials and painting techniques.
The original feature, style and spirit were still kept after the restoration.
The Tianhou Temple was built in 1326. Its original name was Tianfei Temple or Niangniang Temple. It has been through many times of restoration and is now the oldest groups of buildings in the urban area of Tianjin and one of the oldest Mazu Temples in China.
Opening ceremony of Beijing Daxing International Airport held on September 25th
The new aviation hub of Beijing Daxing International Airport is shaped like a phoenix spreading its wings and is honored the top of the "seven wonders in the new world".
Currently, Beijing Capital International Airport is overstressed with more than 100 million passengers handled in 2018. It has become the second airport handling more than 100 million passengers annually right after Atlanta International Airport in the United States.
Beijing Daxing International Airport, whose international code will be PKX, is designed to handle 45 million passengers by 2020 and 72 million passengers by 2025. International airlines will account for 20 percent by 2020 and grow to 30 percent by 2025.
As a new gate of the country, how cool the new airport is?
Located at the junction of Beijing’s Daxing district and Langfang in neighboring Hebei Province, Beijing Daxing International Airport, 46 kilometers from the Tiananmen Square, is the world’s largest aviation terminal housed in a single building.
The area of its steel-framed roof structure is about 180 thousand square meters, or 25 standard football fields, which is the largest in the world.
The new airport is the first terminal in the world that adopted a two-story design for departures, with floor one to four for international arrival, domestic arrival, domestic departure and international departure respectively.
There are two bridges connecting the airport and the expressway outside the terminal and leading to floor three and floor four respectively. The upper one is for international departure, while both of them can lead to domestic departure.
The first flight taking off from Beijing Daxing International Airport marks the beginning of Beijing entering the time of having "double airports".
The new airport is designed to be an international air travel hub, the new source of power for China's development and the hub of communication in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Region supporting the construction of China's Xiong'an New Area. Up to now, 66 airlines have applied to operate at the airport and have been given formal approval. Among them, 20 are domestic airlines and 46 overseas ones.
This year, it is expected to open 116 airlines including 101 domestic ones and 15 international routes at this airport, covering 112 destinations around the world including 97 domestic ones and 15 international ones.
As Beijing's second international airport, Daxing Airport is expected to work, compete and form a world-class "double hub" pattern with Beijing Capital International Airport appropriately. The new airport will not only share and reduce the traffic load on overstressed Beijing Capital International Airport but also meet the rising demand of the capital and the surrounding areas for air travel. Eventually, their development will effectively improve the competitiveness of China's aviation industry.
sure efficiency and quality, considering the geographical condition, the airspace of the airport and the surrounding areas and the operating environment, Daxing International Airport has four runways leading to four different directions, boasts the world's largest automatic air traffic management system and China's largest terminal control area so as to improve the efficiency as much as possible.
It is the first airport with this scale in China to be equipped with a domestically designed automatic luggage transport system and information management system. The innovative systems will significantly improve luggage processing efficiency.
The first flight taking off from Daxing Airport represents a phoenix spreading its wings and flying.
The new airport boasts more than 40 international and domestic firsts. Over 98 percent of the airport's components were locally sourced. With all of these, it will, directly and indirectly, impact industries in the surrounding areas and inject a new spark of life into Beijing's economic development.

Boxiang Wang， The former clerk for the Shouguang County Party Committee in Shandong — — Make the county strong and help people become rich with an innocent heart like a child - Xinhua Net
Boxiang Wang, born in Shouguang of Shandong on February 1943, began to work in 1967 and had served as clerk for the township party committee, clerk for the county party committee, and mayor.
In 1986, Boxiang Wang was appointed as the clerk for the Shouguang County Party Committee in Shandong. At that time, Shouguang was a poor county in Weifang.
During the five years of his position in Shouguang, Boxiang Wang cared about civilians and concentrated on three things: First, boosting the industrialization of vegetables; Second, developing the salt marsh at the north of Shouguang; Third, building the foundation for the development of industry. These helped Shouguang civilians become richer and more confident.
Shouguang farmers had the tradition of vegetable cultivation but also the lesson from it.
In the early 1980s, Shouguang farmers had a good harvest but could not sell the vegetables, letting the vegetables rot in the earth.
Based on the investigations, Boxiang Wang found that the circulation is the key to sell the vegetables.
Shouguang was the first to build the wholesale market for vegetables, serving as the prelude to the development of market economics.
Party members and cadres took the lead, and the county would bear all the losses if they made a mess.
In 1989, 17 party members including Leyi Wang in Sanyuanzhu Village set up 17 vegetable greenhouses that are warm in Winter with the support of Boxiang Wang. At that year, this village had 17 “double households with an annual income of ten thousand yuan".
Then the county established the promotion group. Under the mobilization of Boxiang Wang, Leyi Wang made a tour guide around every village and town and managed to popularize 5000 vegetable greenhouses in the first year. Then the vegetable greenhouses were popularized to the whole county and even the whole country so quickly like the fire on the prairie.
For thousands of years, there have been only 1.6 million acres of salt marsh and shallow beach at the north of Shouguang.
The local civilians had led a very tough life.
The south of Shouguang has the vegetable greenhouses, what about the north of Shouguang?
Boxiang Wang organized tens of thousands of people to camp on the salt marsh and work for nearly 50 days.
Boxiang Wang and the leaders in the county lived at the construction sites and worked with rural laborers. They ate in the wind and slept in the dew, winning the admiration of civilians……During that period, the north of Shouguang developed 150 thousand acres of shrimp pond, 200 thousand acres of salt pan, and 600 thousand acres of cotton field. The economic potential of the salt marsh was fully developed.
In July 1986, Boxiang Wang first attended the industry conference in Weifang as the clerk for the County Party Committee.
During the conference, a form that compared the economic performances across twelve cities and counties in Weifang was issued, and the total production value of industry in Shouguang seemed good, ranking as number four.
However, if the crude salt did not count, Shouguang only had the pure industry production of 119 million Yuan, ranking as the last third one.
Boxiang Wang led more than 70 people to other provinces to exchange experience.
Within one year after coming back, the county invested 150 million Yuan for 77 projects.
After that, they sent groups of people to Shenzhen, Dongguan, Shanghai and other places every year to learn experience.
Shouguang did not have enough enterprises, let alone the entrepreneurs.
Boxiang Wang made a decision on the meeting with special sessions: conducting the public selection for factory directors and managers in the whole county, 40 competent and enterprising people would be selected to work at the front line of industry.
Shouguang was selected into the list of top hundred provinces across the country in 1991, when Boxiang Wang was appointed to as the vice mayor of Wefang.
What he has accomplished are more than 200 thousand vegetable greenhouses, 1.2 million acres of cotton fields, salt pans, shrimp pond, 4854 enterprises, more than 100 thousand “households with an annual income of ten thousand yuan”, and the respected leaders. Until today, the civilians in Shouguang still cordially call him “our Boxiang clerk”.
Yi Wang, the State Councilor and Foreign Minister, presided at the Foreign Minister’s Meeting involving China and African Member Countries of the Security Council at the UN headquarters in New York on September 26 local time.
The Foreign Ministers of current African Member Countries of the Security Council including Tano from Côte d’Ivoire, Oyono from Equatorial Guinea, Pandor from South Africa, and the Foreign Ministers of candidate Member Countries including Carla from Niger and Jehinavi from Tunisia, attended the meeting.
Yi Wang proposed four suggestions to strengthen the cooperation between China and Africa at the Security Council.
First, unity is strength.
The biggest challenge of the current international situation is unilateralism, directly causing the basic norms of international relations to be challenged, impacting on the role of the UN, and damaging the interests of a wide range of developing countries as well as middle and small countries, including African nations.
China and Africa need to go hand in hand and side by side. Unity is strength.
At the Security Council, if the three countries in Africa speak with one voice, their impact will go beyond 3 votes to the whole African continent.
If China stands with Africa, it means more than 4 votes. Instead it will encourage other countries to follow up, affecting and shaping the agenda of the Security Council.
Since 2018, China and the African Members of the Security Council have established a “3+1” coordination mechanism which should be fully used.
Second, troubleshooting is based on negotiation.
China keeps proposing to resolve the front-burner issues through politics. Africa has the good tradition of negotiation and the experience of successful mediation by African regions and organizations of the subzones.
The root cause of most complicated problems on the Security Council’s agenda, especially the hot spot in Africa, is the colonialism. Some other causes are directly associated with external factors.
We should make a good use of the Chapter Six in the UN Chapter, giving full play to the role of the UN in mediation and conciliation.
Third, realizing self-improvement through autonomy.
The nations and people in Africa best understand the problems of Africa. Africa has the ability and intelligence to solve its own problems.
When dealing with the front-burner issues in Africa, the Security Council should give ear to Africa’s will with respect, play a part in organizing regions and subregions, and encourage and support the endogenous solution proposed by Africa.
China is willing to strengthen the coordination with Africa, firmly boosting Africa’s capacity building of peaceful independent actions.
Fourth, resolving the essential problems based on development.
China and a wide range of nations in Africa are developing countries. We should persist in putting the development of economics and society in the first place, mutually supporting our own choices of development path.
China is willing to integrate the co-construction of the Belt and Road into the Africa Union’s 2063 Agenda, the UN’s 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and the development strategies across the countries in Africa, helping African countries improve their development abilities and erase the root cause of their conflicts.
We should jointly promote the UN to invest in the development of Africa.
Given the outbreak of Ebola epidemic in Democratic Republic of the Congo again, China has given and will continue to give the full support, trying their best to provide assistance of manpower, goods and materials. China is also willing to coordinate actions with African countries and to mobilize the UN and the World Health Organization to reinforce their assistance, giving full play to the role of Democratic Republic of the Congo in stabilizing the United Nations Mission in Sudan.
Doctors work in relays to save baby's life.
Thrilling!
A 32-week pregnant mother gave birth to her second baby prematurely in the front passenger seat of her husband's car on the way to the hospital.
Fortunately, gynecologists and neonatologists saved the baby's life by handling the situation in time and working in relays.
Coincidently, on the 19th, 20th and 21st, Hubei Maternity and Child Health Care Hospital has received three premature babies who were all born on the way to the hospital. Besides the baby born in his father's car, the other two were born in the ambulance and were both 29-week premature babies.
Ms Cheng is a mother of two babies. At 7 am on September 19th, she began to feel pain in her abdomen. With the experience of giving birth to her first premature baby, she packed items for labour and was ready to go to the hospital after a shower.
After half-past nine, Ms Cheng packed everything she needed and asked her husband to drive from Xu Dong's to the hospital.
However, just a few minutes after departure, the baby could not wait to get out from his mommy's womb and was born in the front passenger seat of his daddy's car.
Ms Cheng and the baby finally arrived at the building of Hunan Maternity and Child Health Care Hospital 20 minutes later.
The security notified the obstetrics department immediately after seeing the flustered couple and their little baby. Associate Senior Doctor Zhang Huan and other three doctors as well as a midwife Liu Yanyan took bags just yet and rushed downstairs.
"The mother was half lying on the passenger seat at that time. She was sitting on her amniotic fluid and blood. A baby boy was by her side with the umbilical cord uncut."
Zhang Huan was told that it was a 32-week premature baby. The parents did not have time to have him covered. The baby turned pale because of the cold weather in the morning of fall. He was not crying and felt weak all over.
Liu Yanyan hurried to deal with the baby's umbilical cord. Zhang Huan got into the car from the driver's side and opened the bag to cover the baby with a towel and cloth and cleaned his respiratory tract (as the picture shows). The baby was then sent to the obstetrics department on the 12th floor.
Neonatologists rushed to the Nurse Station to rescue the baby after hearing the news.
The baby's face turned purple because of suffocation and a lack of oxygen. Doctors, therefore, intubated the baby immediately. His heartbeat gradually returned and face became rosy after about a minute. The resuscitation was successful.
The 32-week premature baby was put on a respirator after being hospitalized. It was taken away on the second day when the baby's breath became steady after the resuscitation.
After a week of treatment, the baby is now having a stable pathological sign with a smooth breath. He has been fed with a small amount of milk recently.
It was a coincidence that on the 19th, 20th and 21st, the obstetrics department and neonatology department of the hospital has received three premature babies who were born on the way in three days. The other two were born in the ambulance and were both 29-week premature babies. They are all under treatment now.
Head of the obstetrics department of the Provincial Maternity and Child Health Care Hospital Sun Guoqiang said that in recent years, the hospital has received several babies born in subways and cars. It can pose a threat to the life of both mothers and babies if they are not taken good care of.
Sun wants to call people's attention that pregnant mothers should go to a hospital immediately if the pain in the abdomen, water breaking or bleeding happens.
A pregnant woman should try to lie on her back if she is about to give birth at home or on the way. A blanket can be put under the body to protect the baby's head from hitting on the floor. The baby should be kept warmth immediately after birth and should be sent to the nearest hospital as soon as possible.

Earn three points by one free throw?
On the 27th of Beijing time, NBA G League announced an experimental rule change. Under the new rule, one free throw worth one, two or three points will be awarded in the event of any foul that would typically result in one, two or three free throws being shot under standard NBA rules.
Among all NBA stars, Shaquille O'Neal has a relatively low free throw percentage.
According to the new rule, if it is an and-one situation, that one free throw counts as one point, same as always. If players are fouled shooting a two-point shot, the free throw counts as two points. If they are fouled shooting a three-pointer, it counts as three points.
The new rule will not apply during the final two minutes of the fourth quarter or the entirety of any overtime period.
The new rule is only being experimented in the NBA G League in the new season. However, fans are caring more about its impacts on players if the rule is implemented at the NBA level.
Currently, many people believe that this new rule will be beneficial to James Harden but may cause LeBron James some trouble since he is not very good at free throws.
Wuhan offers up to 20 million Yuan in subsidies to promote intelligent technology reconstruction of its industrial enterprises
Wuhan has accelerated its industrial reconstruction since the beginning of this year, and it offers subsidies of up to 20 million Yuan to encourage enterprises to adopt intelligent technology, the reporter has learned on the 27th from the city's series of themed press conferences "A Tribute to New China, Greetings to Military World Games" held by the Information Office of Wuhan Municipal Government.

By offering free consultation and diagnosis services, as well as proposing solutions for the industrial enterprises above the designated size, the plan aims to further facilitate enterprises' technical renovations.
According to the plan, Wuhan will publicly select a group of professional consulting agencies every year, and they will investigate the intelligent technology reconstruction needs of all the industrial enterprises above the designated size in the city by setting up columns, sending out questionnaires, visiting and collecting information, etc..
Up to now, requests from more than 800 industrial enterprises above the designated scale, nearly one-third across the city, have been collected.
Five municipal consulting platforms have organized teams to start serving the enterprises in batches and carry out "one-on-one" on-site evaluation and plan discussion.
Zhang Hong noted that there are 373 intelligent renovation projects currently being implemented in the city and the investment is expected to reach 29.76 billion Yuan. A number of industry leading smart workshops and smart factories have started constructions one after another, such as the first 5G smart production line in central China from Hong in Communications, a country's leading mobile phone smart production line from Motorola, a digital, unmanned transformer factory from Wuhan Siemens, the country's first satellite mass production line from China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation, a world's leading smart production line of new veterinary drugs from Hue Shang Biology, IOT smart production line from EU Smart Home, etc..
In addition, Wuhan will also enhance its fiscal and financial support for intelligent renovation projects.
That includes, an industrial enterprise undergoing intelligent technology reconstruction will be given a subsidy which equals to 8% of its completed investment (including the investment on equipments and hardwares, as well as on research and development) with a cap of 20 million Yuan.
At the same time, the government will also work together with Bank of Communications, Zhejiang Business Bank Wuhan Branch and other financial institutions to provide personalized financial services specifically for the intelligent technology reconstruction of industrial enterprises in order to reduce their financing pressure.
After Justin Trudeau's public persona has collapsed, is he able to still win the re-election
It was Trudeau who dug himself into a big hole, and got quite a cropper this time.
In the past few days many old photos in which the current Prime Minister Trudeau was dressed up as a black man have been exposed by the Canadian media one after another.
It was seen as a blatant act of racial discrimination which immediately had stirred up a shockwave of uproar in Canada.
After it happened, Trudeau has apologized to the public over and over again.
However, Canadian citizens are less than impressed.
Trudeau is doing nothing more than lifting a rock only to drop it on his own feet.
As the political commentator Larry Riley and others have pointed out, since the rise of the "anti-blackface movement" in the United States, Trudeau and the Federal Liberal Party have launched a high-profile campaign by accusing the opposition or the dissenters on their own side of "a breach of honor and integrity" and repeatedly spreading the line that "whoever makes such mistakes should be kicked out immediately."
In short, Trudeau had dug himself into a big hole and got quite a cropper this time.
As the son of former Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, the handsome young Trudeau had triggered off a whirlwind as a "political icon" in his early days of debut.
Once a "novice politician", he took over as the leader of the Federal Liberals and won a surprisingly excellent campaign in Canada's Federal legislative election in 2015. The Liberals secured more that half the seats in the House of Commons and obtained the invaluable power to form a cabinet on its own.
At that time, Trudeau had come up with many mind-blowing political programs and visions, such as "ethnic and gender equality", "ecological-environmental protection" and "economic revitalization," stressing the elimination of corruption and "malpractices" and so on.
However, five years since he came into office, what he did is half-assed in almost all the above fields, "a bit of anticlimax with a fine start but a poor end."
Taking the issue of "ethnic and gender equality" and putting the "blackface" incident aside, he has only "paid lip service" on a series of aboriginal issues, making the aboriginal groups and chiefs move their protesting tents to the gate of Capitol Hill on the 150th anniversary of Canada's founding.
In fighting against corruption, Trudeau had been involved in an uproar regarding the "Lavalin affair" at the turn of this year.
It was revealed that he had put pressure on the authorities and officials responsible for the investigation of irregularity and jobbery of "Lavalin," a construction engineering company from his hometown, by asking the latter "not to be too hard on it."
What's more, after it had blown up into an uproar, Trudeau instead vented his anger on the official disclosing the fraud case. It was the aforementioned Jody Wilson-Raybould, then the Attorney General of Canada, who took the lead to disclose the case and handled directly.
Although the case itself remains suspect, it was hard to get himself out of suspicions.
As many observers have pointed out, largely due to his negligence of "digging himself into holes," Trudeau's pubic persona collapsed five years after he came into power and "the biggest hole" is believed to cover nothing more than the three sides including "his half-assed leadership with a fine start but a poor end," "shooting himself in the foot," and "the sharp contrast between indulging himself and disciplining the others."
Since 2015, supporters for Trudeau have slid all the way from more than 60 percent to more than 30 percent, while his opponents soared from less than 30 percent to more than 60 percent, according to the most authoritative Angus Reid poll data in Canada.
Although other opposition parties and their leaders have shown poor performances as well, quite a portion of voters who would still vote for the Federal Liberals nowadays think incredulously about the persona of the Prime Minister and leader of the ruling party.
As a new term of federal legislative election in Canada is about to start on October 21, will Trudeau be able to replay the drama of a big win five years ago?
The answer may be one word: difficult.
It will bring far-reaching and positive impacts on many levels, whether on business competitions and consumer experiences, or on the regional integration of aviation as well as the integrated development of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei.
Beijing Daxing International Airport had officially opened on Sept 25th.
The Beijing News reporter has learned from the Beijing Municipal Commission of Development and Reform that Beijing Capital Airport has already been in an overloaded operation, and the opening of Daxing International Airport will improve the service capacity of capital aviation.
Following Shanghai, Beijing has become the second player in China to run two airports in the same city. Similar to the business roles of Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport mainly serving domestic flights and Pudong Airport focusing on international shippings, differentiated services are also introduced in the operation of Bejing Capital Airport and Daxing Airport, which will provide more specialized services in niche markets covering both domestic and international aviation business in the future.
The opening of Daxing Airport, from the perspective of business development, will be in favor of the Capital Airport.
The passenger throughput of Capital Airport has exceeded 100 million in the year of 2018, ranking first in China. However, in contrast with the rapidly growing business demand, there is still a larger gap in its total shipping capacity, especially in the needs for international airlines.
In order to better meet the needs of domestic and overseas passengers, including for sightseeing, business trips and so on, and fit in with Beijing's developing momentum of being increasingly open and compatible with international practices, Daxing International Airport is positioned as a large international hub to carry an annual throughput of 100 million passengers and 4 million tons of total cargo in the future.
Therefore, there is no overlapping as to the business roles of two airports which are respectively targeted at different customer segments with enough market potentialities.
Economically speaking, the opening of Daxing International Airport will definitely trigger a win-win effect by relieving the pressure on Beijing's air transport, accelerating the growth rate of passenger and cargo throughput and boosting the incremental growth of Beijing airline service with the dual-core operation.
For the customers, they don't have to rely on the Capital Airport to travel anymore since the opening of Daxing International Airport, which can help reduce a series of problems resulting from the heavy concentration of flight routes such as a longer period of flight support and maintenance, the slowdown of boarding speed, the indirect increase of transit time at the airport for both airlines and passengers. Actually, it can also help improve the passengers' traveling experience by reducing the burden on the Capital Airport's service.
According to the media's calculations on the time and expense of getting to Daxing International Airport via different transportation routes, if you leave from the south fifth-ring road and ride directly to Daxing Airport expressway by passing over Beijing-Kaifeng highway, it will take 50 minutes and cost about 40 yuan for a round trip in addition to an expressway toll of 15 yuan. If you choose the rail transportation by taking Daxing Airport subway, its ticket rates are divided into three levels by 10, 25 and 35 yuan, charged according to the distance limits up from 20 to 30 kilometers. Passengers can also take Beijing-Xiong'an Intercity Railway at the Beijing West Railway Station to get over to Daxing Airport station within just 20 minutes.
In general, there are a lot of transportation options for passengers to get to the Daxing Airport with a reasonable range of cost and time.
For its future development: as the transportion hub in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, Daxing airport is located a little far away from downtown Beijing. However, its radiations to Hebei and Tianjin are strengthened by facilitating the travels of more of the population and is of great significance to promote the economic development of Hebei and Tianjin.
In the future, passengers from Hebei and Tianjin will be able to enjoy more international airline services provided by Daxing International Airport which can be seen from the transportation plan of Daxing International Airport.
The affiliated transportation facilities of Daxing Airport are perfect. In addition to the new airport subway line from downtown Beijing to Daxing Airport, there are several expressways connecting the airport with the neighboring area.
In the same way passengers from Dongguan, Foshan, Qingyuan and other cities in Guangdong can go to Guangzhou Baiyun Airport via the Guangzhou-Foshan, Guangzhou-Shenzhen expressway, residents in Langfang and Xiong'an New Area around Beijing will also benefit from Daxing Airport by enjoying a convenient and efficient air service.
As we can see, the opening of Daxing International Airport does not only mean an increase of runways and planes, but also will have a far-reaching and positive impact, whether on business competition and consumer experience, or the regional integration of aviation and the integrated development of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei. It is not only connected with the long-term development of Beijing air industry to provide a diversified choice of traveling for the general residents in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region and promoting Beijing air industry to further improve its service quality, but also will be more favorable for promoting the integrated development of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei and stimulating the economic development in the surrounding area of the airport.
As to the opening of Daxing Airport, it is necessary for us to not only care about the economical interests individually but also to think big and drive the overall growth of the whole region.

2019 Forum Socio-Economic Situation of Vietnam Held in Thua Thien-Hue
According to Nguyen Duc Kien, vice chairman of the National Assembly (NA)’s Economics Committee, Vietnam’s socio-economic situation maintains its growth and has shown positive signs.
The forum discussed major social-economic issues of Vietnam in the first few months of 2019, as well as measures for Vietnam’s socio-economic development at the end of 2019 and in 2020.
Participants discussed four main topics, including Vietnam’s economic development in 2019 and impacts of free trade agreements, major issues of Vietnam’s economy in 2019, major socio-cultural issues of Vietnam in 2019, and projections and ideas for Vietnam’s socio-economic development in 2020.
Participants believed that, in the first few months of 2019, the global economy witnessed a sluggish growth. We are facing more risks and challenges.
Trade friction between large economies has caused negative impacts on global trade and investment.
According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), despite the uncertainty seen in the global economy with 70% of the economies having economic slowdown, Vietnam made significant achievements in economic development as the macroeconomy has been stable, inflation is under control and the Consumer Price Index (CPI) in the first half of 2019 grew by 2.64% in average, the lowest over the past three years.
The first six months of 2019 witnessed a Gross Domestic Products (GDP) growth by 6.76%, lower than the same period last year which was 7.05%, but much higher than it was in the same period in 2011 to 2017.
When predicting the economic growth in 2019 to 2020, Dang Duc Anh, deputy director of National Socio-Economic Prediction Centre of Vietnam, said that the Vietnamese economy has developed fast in 2019 despite the fact that there has been economic turbulence around the world.
It is estimated that by 2020, the Vietnamese macroeconomy will remain steady. The implementation of free trade agreements will promote trade development. The economic structure will be further improved, so will the business environment. There will be a reduction in export from Vietnam due to global trade friction.
As a result, it is necessary to improve the monitoring and warning mechanism so that remedies for the reduction in export can be taken and opportunities to explore new export market can be found, thus bringing convenience to the export of commodities such as agricultural and aquatic products.
In the meanwhile, inflation should be kept at a reasonable level so to promote the development of supporting industries, high tech agriculture，organic and ecological agriculture, etc..
Liu Zhijie, director of the Siem Reap consulate office of the Chinese embassy in Cambodia, held a reception party in Siem Reap on the 26th to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of New China.
Liu Zhijie said that China had been playing an active role in international affairs in the past 70 years since its founding and had made major contributions to global peace and development by committing to global economic governance and common development with unique solutions of Chinese wisdom, which had brought real benefits to Cambodia's economic development as well as to the well-being of its people.
Liu Zhijie commented that as the world's second largest economy, China's contribution to the global economic growth has exceeded 30%. Particularly driven by China's Belt and Road initiative, in-depth cooperations are under way between China's local cities and Siem Reap as well as other provinces in the consular district.
He added that this year marks the beginning of the 61-year-long diplomatic ties between China and Cambodia; and between the two countries a brotherly friendship has been forged. Cooperations based on mutual benefits between China and Cambodia will certainly drive the local economic and social development.

Witness China's "rise of cloud" in the past ten years in Yunqi Cloud Town - Xinhua Net
If the local website forum in 2009 is regarded as a start, the Yunqi Apsara Conference 2019 held in Hangzhou from the 25th to the 27th was the 10th anniversary of the holding of the conference.
From knowing little about the concept and feeling like "head in the clouds" to the practice of "going up to the cloud" by developing big data and cloud computing, China has witnessed how they became the core technology in supporting China's economic growth, social management and public services.
In the photovoltaic cell workshop of CHINT Group in Haining, China's eastern Zhejiang province, many quality inspectors had new "colleagues" equipped with Alibaba Cloud artificial intelligence by their sides.
It works 24 hours a day, with the recognition speed of more than twice that of a man and the accuracy of quality inspection of more than 95%.
According to the head of the company, the new "quality inspector" equipped with a camera has learnt more than 40,000 flawed samples. With its cloud computing ability, it can quickly convert an infrared image into the binary language and divide the flawed battery cell from the others.
This company is just an example in today's manufacturing transformation supported by cloud computing.
In 2018, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology issued the Guide on Promoting the Using of Cloud Computing in Enterprises (2018-2020), saying that by 2020, enterprises' awareness and enthusiasm for using cloud should be significantly increased, so do the proportion of cloud adoption and depth of application.
Founder of Alibaba Cloud Wang Jian said that today, data-centered cloud computing has built a bridge and opened the way for a digital economy with data as a key element.
Moreover, in the past ten years, the scale of China's cloud computing industry has continued to expand.
According to the White Paper on Cloud Computing Development (2019) released by the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology (CAICT) in July this year, China's overall cloud computing market size reached 96.28 billion Chinese yuan in 2018, an increase of 39.2 percent year-on-year.
On top of becoming a key technology to supporting industrial transformation and the development of the digital economy, the invisible "cloud" has also changed urban management and social life imperceptibly.
At this year's Yunqi Apsara Conference, the City Brain, which has shown up in the past three years' conferences, still attracted a lot of attention.
Alibaba Cloud introduced that at present, the City Brain has shifted from a traffic management tool to the center of a city's management. Related cooperation and application have been expanded to 23 cities around the world.
Through camera perception and artificial intelligence algorithms, the City Brain uses its powerful computing ability to enable new service functions of city management, such as "parking before paying", "real-time monitoring of the number of people seeing a doctor" and "designing of a tourist route".
In terms of government services, cloud computing has brought convenience to both the provider and the receiver of the government services by using "one cloud" to handle "one thing" and promote "offices in phones" and "services in phones" in coordination.
At present, Zhejiang has built a public data platform across the province by applying cloud computing to handling government affairs.
As of September 11, the platform has covered more than 57 million permanent residents and more than 15 million legal entities in the province and collected 19.08 billion pieces of data in 3,066 categories.
Averagely, government departments in Zhejiang province transferred and shared data for 12 million times per month. Every time the data is transferred on the ‘cloud’, it can help the people do less work.
Stay away from plastic tea bags!
The Central News Agency reported that a recent study in Canada found that a plastic tea bag might release billions, or even ten billions of plastic particles, which are significantly more than the estimated amount of microplastics consumed by a person in an entire year. However, as of now, there is no evidence suggesting the ingestion of microplastics can pose a risk to human beings.
According to the report, researchers from McGill University in Canada have found that a plastic tea bag steeped in a cup of almost boiling water (95 Celsius degrees) can release around 11.6 billion micro plastic particles and 3.1 billion smaller nanoscale particles into the cup.
This is significantly higher than the estimated amount of microplastics consumed by a person in an entire year.
According to research published earlier in 2019, a person eats at least 50,000 micro plastic particles and breathes in the same quantity.
In this study, published in the journal Environmental Science and Technology, researchers are reported to have tested four different types of plastic commercial tea bags from shops and cafés in Montreal, which were cut open, washed, and then steeped into near-boiling water for five minutes before being analyzed by electron microscopes and spectroscopy.
According to this study, they have found that a single tea bag can release 11.6 billion micro plastic particles, which is "several orders of magnitude higher than the plastic loads previously reported in other foods."
The report says, although most tea bags are made from natural fibers, many tea bag brands that use natural fibers still use plastic to seal the bags.
Some brands have moved away from paper tea bags toward plastic tea bags, and it was these plastic bags that the researchers examined.
Microplastics are tiny pieces of plastic, which are defined by researchers as ranging from 100 nm to 5 mm in size and mostly created by the disintegration of plastic litter.
Researchers have found traces of microplastics in the air, soil, rivers, and the deepest oceanic trenches around the world, as well as in tap and bottled water, seafood, and beer.
Researchers found microplastics in human stool samples for the first time in October 2018.
In order to test the potential toxicity of the microplastics released from the tea bags, this Canadian research team exposed water fleas to the contaminated water and found that the particles had behavioral effects on the fleas and caused developmental malformations.
There is no evidence so far that the ingestion of microplastics poses a risk to humans, according the World Health Organization (WHO).
However, WHO pointed out that more research was needed to fully understand how plastic spreads into the environment and what effects it has on human bodies.
Researchers speculated that the reason of the high number of microplastics released by the tea bags was that the plastic packaging had been in contact with boiling water. Even "food-grade" plastics may degrade or leach toxic substances when heated above 40 degrees.
Guterres indicated that the climate emergency poses the biggest threat to the survival of small island countries.
A natural disaster would jeopardize a generation’s development achievements in those countries.
The disaster situation in Barbuda, Dominica and Bahamas where have suffered from the hurricane attack since this year explains this viewpoint.
About a quarter of people in the small island developing countries live at an altitude of 5 meters or lower.
The removal might exert a strong influence on their society and lifestyle, and even cause the problems of sovereignty and national identity.
On the Climate Action Summit this Monday, small island countries made joint efforts to realize the 100％ renewable energy with carbon neutrality by 2030 whereby they would lead the world to step towards the correct direction again.
Guterres said: “the climate crisis is heaping up the new injustice on the previous injustice”.
Although small island countries made the least contribution to treating the global warming, they paid the highest price.
Due to their middle-income status, many of these countries are still trapped in the deterioration of disaster and debt, as well as the circle of unsustainability.
The world must take actions. It is time to make important decisions and invest heavily in small island developing countries.
A political declaration was passed on today’s high-level meeting, appealing for help to manage the disaster risk in small island developing countries and investing in the infrastructure with climate adaptability and the method for the transformation towards renewable energy; It urges the international organizations to help small island developing countries, especially the middle-income countries in heavy debt, obtain the funding.
The small island developing countries are at the forefront to conserve the lifeblood of the earth — — the ocean.
The updated special report, issued by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change this week, demonstrated that the ocean has suffered from the severe consequences of the continuous climate crisis.
By mid-century, the extreme rise in sea-level that used to occur once a century, might occur in many regions every year.
This report warns that some island countries will probably become uninhabitable if they do not invest in the adaptability.
The pollution, overfishing and acidification have caused a great loss.
In the past 150 years, the world had lost half of the live coral. In the past 40 years, the plastic pollution had witnessed a tenfold increase.
The demand for industry, shipping, mining and tourism is causing the depletion of resources, including the fisheries that maintain many island communities.
The small island countries are also facing the high cost of transportation, energy and infrastructure.
They rely heavily on some external markets, making them vulnerable to the price fluctuation.
Some countries are also attempting to cope with the safety hazard caused by the illegal trade in human beings, weapons and drugs.
Guterres said: “By solving a problem in the most challenging environment, this problem can be solved anywhere”.
The efforts that small island developing countries made to realize the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development provide the world with the tools, lessons and instances that can be used for reference.
He stressed that the small island developing countries are the special case of sustainable development.
They need the long-term attention and investment from the whole international society.
The Ministry of Finance of India stated that the financial system has sufficient liquidity.
Indian Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman stated on the 26th that the current financial system has sufficient liquidity. Driven by consumer demand during holidays, India's economic growth is expected to recover in the second half of this fiscal year.
Sitharaman's statement was made after meeting with representatives from institutions such as Indian private banks, non-bank financial institutions and housing banks.
Sitharaman did not specify where the statement was aimed at.
Before this, some Indian and overseas media attributed India's constant economic slowdown to the tension in liquidity in non-bank financial institutions.
By taking car sales as an example, Sitharaman denied that the tension in liquidity was the main reason for the decline in sales.
She also pointed out that the decline in car sales was mainly caused by cyclical factors.
Driven by the consumption in holidays, India's economic growth may recover in the second half of this fiscal year, according to Sitharaman.
India's annual shopping season is from September to the end of the year.
It is predicted that shopping and consumption will significantly promote India's economic growth.
The Provincial Department of Education of Jiangxi recently issued a notice prohibiting all primary and secondary schools in the province from violating the regulations against extra classes during the National Day holiday. Inspectors will conduct public and private investigations randomly.
In their "Notice on the prohibition of violating the regulations against extra classes during the National Day holiday," the Provincial Department of Education of Jiangxi stressed that primary and secondary schools should also carefully observe the following points: No collective extra classes or new lessons; no subject training, specialized tutorials, Olympic competition tutorials, non-academic tutorials, or progressive training; no campus or school buildings should be rent to any training institutions.
Meanwhile, primary and secondary school teachers are strictly prohibited from organizing or recommending any extra training, or encouraging students to attend such training on- or off-campus. They are also strictly prohibited from working for training institutions outside the school or extra classes organized by other teachers, parents, or parents’ committees, and from recommending students or providing information for such institutions or individuals.
The notice states that if any primary and secondary schools have extra classes, once the case is confirmed, a significant deduction will be applied to the local administrative department of education in the county-level governmental assessment of high-quality development of education in that year. Teachers who take part in extra classes will be subject to serious penalty in compliance with the regulations of teaching ethics.
Support the hog production to ensure the market supply
Sui Zhongcheng requires to implement various measures from 6 aspects.
The video conference promoting the hog production throughout the province to ensure market supply has been held today. It serves to remobilize and redeploy the implementations of the policies and measures of the central and provincial committees and governments to support the hog production so as to guarantee its market supply.
Sui Zhongshi requires that all measures for hog production be implemented from 6 aspects.
It stresses on the implementation of the mayor responsibility system of the “food basket”. The clearly specified provincial-wide slaughter task of 45 million pigs of this year has been assigned to cities and prefectures. The task is included in the mayor responsibility system assessment.
It stresses on the implementation of various policies and measures, paying special attention to effectively solve the “last step” problem of the implementation.
It stresses on the sow production through the earnest implementation of the subsidy policy for capable sow breeding, the encouragement of the expansion of the scale in sow breeding businesses, and the pre-planned selection of outstanding sows from the group of commodity pigs.
It stresses on the implementation of the investment attraction and regards bringing in domestically well-known and large-scale breeding enterprises that have not entered into our province as the top priority of the investment attraction.
It stresses on the implementation of the market circulation system by expediting the facility construction for the cold chain logistic of hogs, comprehensively promoting the changes from “allocating hogs” to “allocating pork”.
It stresses on the modern epidemic prevention system. All localities should be equipped with grassroots epidemic prevention and quarantine personnel, the number of which should be suitable for the breeding scale and work tasks, so as to build the first line of defense for epidemic prevention and control.
Sui Zhongcheng requires to fully guarantee the supply in the meat market, ensuring that there is no large-scale shortage and supply cuts, as well as ensuring a stable supply of pork on market during major holidays.
The conference also deploys on the prevention and control of the swine fever epidemic, the ban and withdraw of fishing within important waters in the Yangtze River basin of the province and the late rice acquisition across the province.
Talking about attachment to the motherland and the national spirit: Representatives from Shanghai’s time-honored brands like White Rabbit Creamy Candy delivered Party lessons for university students
The campus check-in points for "My country and I" became the new obsessions of university students.
In celebrating the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, four famous time-honored brands of Shanghai, namely the Shanghai Soap, Shao Wansheng, White Rabbit, Xiandelai, gathered in "Party's art lesson" on the 27th at East China University of Science and Technology. Four representatives from these time-honored brands, with an average history of over 90 years, talked about their attachment to their motherland and national spirit for over 200 young students.
The on-site display of products from the time-honored brands.
The passionate talk amazed the students, who were surprised that a display of products from these time-honored brands had been carefully set up outside the classroom. Also, the campus check-in points for "My country and I" became the new obsessions of university students.
White Rabbit lip balm, White Rabbit ice cream... As a time-honored brand, White Rabbit Creamy Candy in recent years has been seeking transformations and taking initiatives with insistence on innovation and crossover.
As it happens, this brand, founded in 1959, came to celebrate its 60th birthday this year.
Shao Wansheng also turned its attention to young consumers.
Wang Weijie, secretary of the Party branch and deputy general manager of the Shao Wansheng Food Company, Shanghai, described the scenes in which people "eat abalone in lively spring, pickled fish in blazing summer, drunken shrimps in cool autumn, and drunken crabs in cloudy winter," representing unceasing innovation in food culture.
The company also further explored its brand culture via new flavors, comic package designs, etc. to cater for its transmission among the young consumers.
Representatives from the time-honored brands are telling the stories about their journey of innovation at the "Party's art lesson."
Similarly, Yu Jie, manager of Shanghai Xiandelai Pork Ribs Rice Cake Restaurant Co., Ltd, said, "All innovations are rooted in a solid foundation. Every innovation of time-honored brands is a demonstration of its rich tradition.
Everyone has his or her expectations of a time-honored brand.
We should enter an age that focuses on small yet exquisite products."
As one of the first China Time-honored Brands in this country, Shanghai Xiandelai has quickly adapted to the trends of the market, upgraded their visual identity of the brand, employed professional management team, and thereby achieved a substantial increase in turnover.
"The time-honored brands are not just displayed in traditional channels such as supermarkets. We are actively engaging with new retailers and various events.
All these changes are made to reach one goal: We want the consumers to see our products, hear about them, and eventually buy them,"
said Ouyang Yiling, deputy manager of Shanghai Soap Co., Ltd.
In the future, Shanghai Soap will continue to insist on high-end development that systematically focuses on energy-saving, environment-friendly products that bring great prospects and user satisfaction. It will also insist on the high-tech path of high economic benefits.
Students have learned a lot from the Party's art lesson this time.
I grew up with the time-honored brands, which bring back sweet childhood memories and emotions, "
Song Tianyuan said with sentiments.
The representative from a time-honored brand of Shanghai is talking about their attachment to their motherland and national spirit for over 200 young students.
The student Zhou Yiting said it was the task of those who study design to think and explore how to present brand culture so that the good-quality traditional culture can be transmitted to posterity.

Shinzo Abe congratulates China on 70th anniversary of PRC founding and speaks Chinese in the video
On the 26th local time, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe sent a congratulatory video to mark the upcoming 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe: Good evening ladies and gentlemen, I am Shinzo Abe.
I would like to take the occasion of the 70th anniversary of the PRC founding to extend the warm congratulations on behalf of the Japanese government and people.
During the 2019 G20 Osaka Summit held in June, China and Japan worked together to achieve the success of the Summit and passed the G20 Osaka Leaders’ Declaration, showing the strong will of G20 member countries to the world.
Moreover, during the summit and the banquet, we reached an agreement on President Xi Jinping's state visit to Japan in spring next year. We also reached an important consensus on building Sino-Japanese relations that meets the requirements of the new era.
Both China and Japan are sharing a great responsibility for peace and prosperity in Asia and beyond.
I firmly believe that Japan and China's joint responses to regional and global issues as well as joint contributions to the international community are of great significance for building a new model for the two countries' relations in the future.
In the end, with my best wishes, I hope that Sino-Japan relations will prosper, so will your business.
Over-aged migrant workers at some construction sites are estimated to make up more than half of the total labor force.
Where to find the young workers now?
"There is no other choice but to employ so many old workers at the construction site."
Zou Kui, a contractor who has worked in the construction industry for years, wrote recently on the common scene of over-aged migrant workers (above the retirement age) on construction sites.
In recent times, the college where the writer works started a rainwater and sewage diversion project and therefore many migrant workers came to the campus. If you look out you could find many of over-aged workers inside.
Over-aged migrant workers choose to work outside not because they don't like to stay idle, but because they can't be idlers. With utter helplessness of having to do so, these old people who should not be working are driven to keep working hard, whether to save money to support their own livelihoods and provisions of medical healthcare, or for helping their children.
The final solution to the problem of keeping over-aged migrant workers healthy and out of poverty doesn't come easily as we had thought.
Raising a family, supporting the elderly, educating children, helping children build houses and buy cars, helping children get married and raise grandchildren, when these migrant workers have finished all these life tasks, their moneybags have been emptied, even ending up with debts, and most of them are short of wealth accumulation.
In order not to bring their children more trouble and save more money for their own benefits, many migrant workers insist on "working til they can do nothing".
A new generation of migrant workers, including many post-80s, post-90s and even post-00s, are unwilling to accept work in the secondary or low-end service industry of dirty work and of high labor intensity. This results in the structural shortage of a qualified labor force and brings opportunities for over-aged migrant workers.
Without excellent skills, physical energy and work efficiency, many over-aged workers have to be concentrated in jobs of high work intensity, high risks, low income, and low security.
The more you are able to work, the more you are able to earn. The survival predicaments of over-aged migrant workers (beside the fact that they can't be idlers) cannot be ignored and overlooked.
To solve their problems of getting unpaid wages, improving labor protection, reducing safety risks, increasing work wages, and improving the living conditions for those over-aged migrant workers, regulatory interventions and humane concerns from public administrations are also inseparable in addition to their own self-struggling.
Some scholars have pointed out that over-aged workers are unlikely to rely on farming at home to sustain their retirement life and healthcare; they must support their families through other means.
Their desperation and determination reflected in the fact that over-aged migrant workers have to keep busy will help us better understand their love and pains.
Seeing their backs and hearing their sighs, the administration, market and society have to work favorably and share responsibilities in a joint effort to help those over-aged migrant workers become financially independent after their return to the countryside.
Chemetsov said that Russia would not export this kind of system in the next five years, because “it will be first supplied to domestic army before export”.
This action completely conforms with the international convention.
The major manufacturing countries of weapon and military equipment would always put their own defensive needs in the first place before processing the export orders.
Earlier, the Deputy Commander of the Russian Air and Space Force, General Yuri Grekhov, suggested that the development of this system was about to be completed.
The S-500 system was developed by the Concern of “Adamas-Antai” Aerospace Defense.
This is a new generation of air defense system which employs the principle aimed at destroying the ballistics and aerodynamics.
The main function of S-500 is to intercept the intermediate-range ballistic missiles, and it can intercept the missiles within a range of 3500 kilometers.
Furthermore, according to some data, S-500 can also destroy the hypersonic cruise missiles, airplanes, almost all types of pilotless airplanes, the hypersonic missiles that are more than 5 times faster than the velocity of sound, and even the targets near the space.
This type of weapon can also be integrated into other air defense systems to be an unified network, especially the S-400 system, which is vert important to the national defense.
Sergey Chemetsov expressed his special focus on the S-400.
He said, there is a great demand for this system in the world. However, the Russian armies, including those at the arctic region, also need it.
The S-400 air defense system came into service at the arctic regiment of air defense.
According to the report on September 15, the arctic regiment of air defense in Nova Zembla had finished refitting the S-400 air-defense missile system.
This is not Russia’s militarization at the arctic region.
The Ministry of Defense of Russia claimed that this is entirely part of the interim plan to equip the northern strategic direction with more advanced defensive tools.
According to the information office at the Northern Fleet of Russia: “With the transition to the new S-400 air defense system, the controlled airspace within the arctic region is markedly increased.”
What counts is that this system works very well at the Far North and the arctic region based on the military evaluations.
The officers and soldiers at the regiment of air defense were drilled for the new system, and made preparations for combat duty.
It used to be equipped with the S-300 long-range air defense system which is partly reserved now.
When it comes to the air defense system, it must be equipped with weapons that can destroy a variety of aerial targets no matter they are high-speed flights at the high altitude or “the fish that escapes from the net” approaching the protected facilities.
According to the public source information, the S-400 “Triumph” developed by the Concern of “Adamas-Antai” Aerospace Defense is designed to attack the strategic aircrafts and TACAIRs, ballistic missiles, hypersonic targets and other air weapons.
This weapon can attack the targets of aerodynamics within a range of 400 kilometers, and shoot down the ballistic targets flying at the speed of 4.8 kilometers per second within a range of 60 kilometers.
Russia has never concealed the fact that it will improve its deployment of air defense force at the Far North, to ensure the safety of its territorial air space.
Not long ago, the first 12 sets of “Tor- M2DT” system of air-defense missile were delivered to the arctic region of Russia, forming a battalion of air defense to strengthen the air-defense system at the arctic region.
At that time, the Ministry of National Defense of Russia indicated that the “Tor” troops would be extended to be a complete brigade-level organizational system.
Coupled with the S-400 long-range system deployed at Nova Zembla and Kola Peninsula and the “Pantsir-SA” short-range system deployed at the Far North, these cutting-edge air-defense weapons are protecting the polar sky of Russia effectively.
The enemies’ warplanes, helicopters and robombs can hardly break through this defense.
According to the Russian government, flagship stores are going to become platforms for Russian manufactures to showcase their products so as to avoid the complicated and lengthy process of opening their own stores.
As a store operator of Russian products, Epinduo specializes in selling Russian goods within China.
Epinduo has opened online stores on most of the largest trading platforms in China including Tmall, JD, 1688, Pinduoduo, ShouQ and Wechat, a multifunctional instant messaging software. Besides, the company has its own online platform, Epinduo.com, and its own commodity retail chain stores.
Russian Export Center will join hands with Epinduo to develop store marketing strategies and participation standards, as well as to screen companies with the qualification to list products on the virtual shelves.
It is planned to open and list products from at least 10 Russian manufactures before the end of this year.
According to the information from Russian Export Center, the total monthly visit of China e-commerce platforms reaches up to 1 billion.
Meanwhile, food exports to China have been showing a steady growth since 2014, have surpassed 1 billion US dollars in 2018.
At present, the Alibaba Group will also open pilot stores to sell products from New Zealand, Malaysia, and Singapore within the global import strategic framework.
According to Alexei Kozhevnikov, the new store will display products from companies with sales of at least 500 million rubles.
Honestly speaking, I have a higher expectation. 500 million rubles is not worth mentioning compared to the sales amounts they are going to achieve.
We all know that Chinese customers hold very positive attitudes towards Russian products and accept Russian products as high-quality, green and environmentally friendly.
Kozhevnikov expressed that the competition for the strong purchasing power of Chinese consumers is intense and is still intensifying.
“We have an ambitious goal that is to launch 500 companies through this store within 3 years，” he said.
At the same time, the store will list products manufactured by companies from Russian Far East.
According to Professor Vyacheslav Cheglov, from the Department of Basic Trade Policy of Plekhanov University of Economics in Russia, “this is a political project representing the images of both parties because Russian Export Center is an state-owned rather than a private institution.”
“I haven’t seen an abundance of highly competitive Russian products in the market.”
He thinks it is not likely for the project to be actually implemented, but it’s helpful to strengthen the ties between the two countries.
According to RIA Novosti, Andrey Slepnev, President of the Russian Export Center, indicated during the Eastern Economic Forum that the product information of about 170 Russian companies has already been released on Alibaba.com, the largest international wholesale online platform. Those products can be purchased from both China and any other countries around the world.
Moreover, there is another mode of cooperation with the Alibaba Group, namely, the training project of specialists from Taobao University for Russian companies. The first seminar of this training project has been held in July this year.
The Russian Export Center will also organize Russian companies to participate in the industry exhibition and the commercial projects sections at the 2nd China International Import Expo in November this year.
A large exhibition will be held in a showroom of 1000 square meters. The same place is also become the venue to hold business project activities, agreement signing ceremonies, promotion meetings and talks with representatives of Chinese companies.
So far, the Expo has received about 50 applications from Russian agribusiness.
According to the press office of the Russian Export Center, “besides setting up agricultural booths, we will hold business meetings to provide opportunities for entrepreneurs to establish direct connections.”
“Such is another direction of our efforts. Our goal is to support those companies and to ensure to arrange dozens of special meetings for them.”
Furthermore, master classes, cooking competitions, and celebrity-chef-cooked Russian food tastings as a part of the project of “Exploring Russian Cuisine, Shanghai Station” will be organized during the Expo.

When does the next bus come?
"Internet + Smart Display" will tell you.
Nanjing Smart Traffic, in collaboration with Gaode Map, announced on the 27th that the first batch of the country's "Internet + Smart Display" were officially installed in Nanjing, where 54 digital displays will be turned on at bus stops. This will bring the information services of Nanjing to the next level, and increase the efficiency of public transport services and the happiness of passengers.
The anxiety of waiting used to haunt bus stops almost on a daily basis.
As it is difficult to predict bus schedules, and it is difficult to know road conditions and bus locations, the problems of public transport are in need of solution. In some big cities, commuters have a long way to travel, and the traffic situation at peak times are complex, which often leads to bus delays.
Therefore, Nanjing Smart Traffic and its collaborator Gaode Maps explored the new approach of "Internet + Transport" services and launched a project on intelligent services that installed the country's first batch of "Internet + Smart Display."
It is reported that the first batch of "Internet + Smart Display" launched in Nanjing integrate the big data of Gaode and its ETA algorithm of estimated vehicle travel time. By updating the internet and big data of travel on the digital displays at bus stops, the project offers services including publishing bus routes on the two ends of "Smart displays at bus stops + digital maps" and estimating the arrival time of the next bus.
With "Internet + Smart Display," Nanjing citizens can easily get the estimated arrival time of the next bus, real-time location of the bus, and how many stops it is away from the current stop. They can also quickly view road conditions along the bus route via a display in red, orange, and green, and see all buses that pass the current stop.
Thanks to the new technology of "Internet + Smart Display," Nanjing citizens can now enjoy more convenient and efficient public transport that allows them to check the bus location before leaving and to know when the next bus arrives and when they will arrive at their destinations.
They can choose the most appropriate route based on the real-time traffic information provided by "Internet + Smart Display" and know exactly what to expect, which relieves the anxiety of waiting and brings a more relaxing travel experience.

Xinhua News Commentary: unswervingly take our own path
A white paper titled "China and the World in a new Era" was released on June 27, which explains that the fundamental reason for China's success in development over the past 70 years is that the Chinese people have found the right path of developing socialism with Chinese characteristics under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and will unswervingly continue to follow the path.
It is the choice of history and the choice of the people for China to follow a development path suitable for itself.
In modern times, generations of people with lofty ideals have made endless efforts to save the country and the people in an environment of poverty and weakness, internal strife and foreign invasion.
However, "constitutional monarchy, imperial restoration, parliamentary system, multi-party system, presidential system have been considered and tried, all of them ended up with failures".
It was not until the Communist Party of China and the new China came that the Chinese people gradually blazed a path of socialism with Chinese characteristics in practice.
The path China has taken is the path of happiness for the Chinese people and the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, as well as the universal harmony of common development between China and other countries in the world.
It is just because China is on the right path that it can run its own affairs well, become the world's second largest economy and the biggest contributor to global growth, continue to benefit the world with its own development.
As the white Paper points out, China's development goes in line with its national conditions and meets the requirements of the times, and will show more and more bright prospects as the time goes by.
Looking back, Chinese people know very well how difficult it is to find the right path. Looking around the world, Chinese people will cherish this right path even more.
Chinese people understand the truth that "orange changes with the environments," they know that what is suitable for others may not fit in with their conditions, only what suits themselves is the best.
It is with such confidence in its path and willpower for its strategy that China has created the miracles which have drawn the attention of the world.
In the twists and turns of human history, "the End of History" had once made a noise in the world.
Today, the success achieved by the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics announces the end of the "End of History," the collapse of the "Collapse of China" and the failure of the "failure of socialism."
The success of China has boosted the confidence of developing countries to become rich and strong, expanded the path for developing countries to achieve modernization, and brought experience and reference for other countries and nationalities that wish to speed up their development and maintain their independence by following a path suitable for their national conditions.
The world is diversified.
China has always respected the rights of all countries to choose a development path suited to their national conditions.
China will not "import" foreign models or "export" the Chinese model. Instead, China will remain committed to its own path, realize its own development, strengthen the exchanges with other countries on the governance and administration of state affairs, and make its due contribution for the joint implementation of good governance and fine administration.
The Fair Work Commission found that a Foodworks supermarket owner dismissed a 66-year-old female worker by text message due to his preference for hiring employees of an Asian background. The owner was strongly denounced as "shameful" for what he did.
Ms. Ayton had served at the Wagga Wagga store for more than 20 years. The Commission said how the owner Jianbin Wang (Eddie by English name) treated the employee was "extremely unfair" and likely breached anti-discrimination laws.
Ms. Ayton told the Commission that Mr. Wang "has been trying to get rid of me" since his takeover of the store in 2016, because she is not Chinese.
In this case, deputy president of the Commission Peter Sams conducted a search on the web, and located “some job ads posted by Mr. Wang on various Chinese Australian's job forums in the past".
Among the requirements for these jobs, one said "Asian female preferred", while another went as "Asian staff preferred".
In the third, he posted "more prefer oversea people" (sic).
Mr Wang dismissed Ms. Ayton by text message in April this year, and later alleged that it was due to her absences from work and money shortages with amounts missing between $5.10 and $30 in cash registers.
However, Mr. Sams noted that reasons given by Mr Wang for his dismissing Ms. Ayton were rather weak, and there was lack of evidence.
In the past three years, she had only one day of non-attendance, and the "money shortages" were only totaled at a few Australian dollars.
He remarked that the dismissal of Ms. Ayton "actually had nothing to do with her behaviors or performance".
“In my view, supported by the job advertisements posted by Mr. Wang, the respondent’s real motive for dismissing her was Mr. Wang’s preference to hire staff of Asian speaking backgrounds,” he said.
“According to section 772(f) of the Fair Work Act, prima facie, Mr Wang’s conduct constituted a breach of anti-discrimination laws and/or the applicant’s dismissal was for an unlawful reason.”
Mr. Sams pointed out that it was inadequate for Mr. Wang to bring back Ms. Ayton's for the job given how "appalling" he had treated her.
He should instead consider to pay in compensation for Ms. Ayton, who was a temporary staff with an hourly wage of 26 Australian dollars.
Sams expressed that in light of any possible violation of the anti-discrimination and industrial relations legislation, he would submit his verdicts and files to the General Manager of Commission for consideration as to whether to hand Wang's case over to other agencies for further investigation of potential breaches of state or Commonwealth laws.
He added, Mr Wang didn't give Ms. Ayton any chance to respond to the alleged reasons of her dismissal.
He said, "I think the respondent has taken an irredeemably unjust and prejudiced procedure to dismiss the applicant. Mr. Wang "waited for" the opportunity, and he believed this would "justify" his terminating the employment of the applicant."
"He was wrong... The respondent had absolutely treated the applicant unfairly when she was dismissed. It was shocking that he was rude and extremely unjust."
Mr. Sams noted that although Foodworks runs a small business, "I have to be frank that no decent employer will sack their employees in an extremely unfair and careless way as acknowledged in this case."
He said, "It is shameful, and also extremely inequitable."

Staying with the country: a sketch of a formation of the Armed Police Force
It was in the golden autumn. On the parade training ground, a formation of the Armed Police Force, consisting of soldiers with an average height of 1.83 meters, were busy with training.
Shiny bayonets, unique olive-green color, and red epaulets constitute a splendid view.
A few days ago, the reporter visited this formation and learned about how these soldiers of the Armed Police Force were determined to be the loyal guards of the Communist Party and the people forever, and about their belief in and pursuit of "honor."
"Dreams shine through a brilliant life and write an eternal legend of the new age," say the lyrics of "Stay with the country," written by the soldiers of the formation collectively.
This song has become the motto of every member of the formation.
Qi Xiaoguang, who is 1.92 meters tall, is particularly impressive in the formation.
As the former flag bearer of the flag guard of the Armed Police Force, he has a deeper understanding of honor.
Soldiers' honor comes from tough training.
As a flag bearer, Qi Xiaoguang has always been trained to meet high standards and strict requirements.
He tied sandbags to himself to maintain posture, used a stopwatch to regulate his marching speed, regulated his step length with an eye fold, and improved his marching step consistency against wild wind.
In his "career of flag bearing," there was one unforgettable scene.
In a flag raising ceremony, despite the downpour, no one in the audience who came for the ceremony had left.
When the flag was raised, Qi Xiaoguang felt, from the bottom of his heart, the glory represented by the Five-starred Red Flag on his shoulder.
Qi Xiaoguang was selected as a pivot in the parade.
The standards for a pivot are different from those for a flag bearer.
Qi Xiaoguang said that, although the difference in step frequency between a flag bearer and a pivot was just over 20 steps, the training of the latter required more efforts.
A pivot is the first one in the first row and determines how orderly the whole formation is.
After the collective parade training began, he practiced kicking repeatedly every day and firmly established his strength.
In the rehearsal, his precise step length and speed won him rounds of applause from other soldiers.
In the formation, almost every soldier has the same experience with Qi Xiaoguang.
Twenty years ago, the father of the soldier Zhu Xudongfa participated the military parade at the 50th anniversary of the country on the National Day.
In order to follow his father's footsteps to join the formation, Zhu Xudongfa came across discouragement again and again, yet he never gave up.
He said, "It is my lifetime honor to be able to march through the Tiananmen Square like my father and to accept the inspection of the Party and the people. I am willing to endure any hardship."
When one walks into the formation's Room of Honors, eight big characters comes in sight, which reads, “A crack troop that safeguards the capital's stability.”
Wang Qian, political commissar of the formation, said that the soldiers of this formation all came from the Beijing City Corps, People’s Armed Police Force, a troop with a glorious tradition. They were responsible for the guard and security of the country's founding ceremony and the series of national congress of the Party, and for countering terrorism and safeguarding stability in the capital. They have also produced a great number of exemplary groups and individuals, including "National Flag Guardians" and the "National Guardian Hero Squadron." More than 50 groups and individuals were granted honorary titles by the State Council, the Central Military Commission, and the Armed Police Force.

Vice Premier Han Zheng attended the reception and conveyed thanks and regards on behalf of the Chinese government and President Xi Jinping to all foreign experts and international friends for their care and support for China's reform, opening up and modernization drive.

The Chinese nation has therefore achieved a tremendous transformation — it has stood up, grown rich, and become strong.
Ever since the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, the Party Central Committee led by President Xi Jinping has implemented the five-sphere integrated plan and the four-pronged comprehensive strategy, so that the Party and the country could have historic achievements and historic shifts and socialism with Chinese characteristics could cross the threshold into a new era.
China's progress in the past seven decades was the result of the unremitting efforts of the Chinese people of all ethnic groups and the hard work by foreign experts.
In the past 70 years, many foreign experts have come to China and support China's modernization drive along with the Chinese people. Their contributions are valuable and will never be forgotten by the Chinese people.
Han pointed out that China now stands at a new historical starting point in its development. The Chinese people are now securing a decisive victory in building a moderately prosperous society in all respects, striving for the great success of socialism with Chinese characteristics for a new era and working tirelessly to realize the Chinese Dream of national rejuvenation.
China will continue to pursue development as the Party's top priority, talent as the most important resource and innovation as the primary force driving development. The country will carry out the innovation-driven development strategy and promote high-quality economic development.
China will support innovation by small and medium-sized enterprises and encourage the application of advances in science and technology, as the people is the most creative and energetic factor.
Han stressed that China's cause is supported by people all around the world. It learns from the world and requires cooperation with the world.
China will be more open and inclusive, always stand ready to learn from the world, and bring in more talents with a more proactive, open and effective policy.
We sincerely welcome more foreign experts to China to spark innovation and pursue successful careers. We also welcome the talents from all over the world to be part of our modernization drive and make even greater contribution to building a community with a shared future for mankind, to world peace and development and to human progress.

Vietnam should take advantage of AI to boost the economy.
In terms of the level of preparation for the coming of AI, cities were ranked based on four key criteria, including the prospect, the execution ability; the asset base and the development trajectory.
Singapore was ranked top one among all, followed by cities in the UK, the US, France, Sweden, the Netherlands, Germany and Australia.
Timocine Pervane, an expert from Oliver Wyman Forum, said in an interview that "Reviewing and assessing Vietnamese cities such as Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City was meaningful.
Generally speaking, I believe that with a high growth rate, significant economic development and growing skilled workers, Vietnam has a bright prospect.
I believe Vietnam is on the right track towards the AI age.
It is important for the country to take advantage of changes produced by the Fourth Industrial Revolution to further boost its economic development."
AI is now changing how people work, communicate and live.
It brings not only higher efficiency, but also threats such as social, economic and technological inequality.
However, a research from Oliver Wyman showed that cities around the world were all prepared for the breakthroughs brought by the AI age.

About 800 million people to travel in the National Day holiday reflect the booming supply and demand of China's tourism industry
About 800 million people will travel in the upcoming "National Day" Golden Week!
Big data from a number of tourism platforms shows that the supply and demand in China's tourism consumption market are booming.
The Ctrip National Day Tourism Report predicts that with reference to the previous National Day tourism statistics, it is expected that the number of domestic tourists during the National Day holiday this year will be close to 800 million; in addition, there will be more than 7.5 million outbound tourists.
At present, there are tourists from more than 500 cities booking package tours, self-guided tours, customized tours, local entertainment and other products on the platform, involving 100 countries and regions.
According to the estimation by the China Tourism Research Institute, a total of 726 million Chinese tourists travelled across the country during last year's National Day holiday, a year-on-year increase of 9.43%.
Not only will the number of tourists climb up to a new height this year during the National Day holiday, but also the consumption upgrade will become the "main theme" of tourism in the National Day holiday.
Ctrip reports noted that the national per capita cost of cross-provincial tourism during the National Day holiday was more than 3,000 Yuan, an increase from the same period last year, as tourists generally chose products with better experience, such as high-rated brand hotels, non-shopping tour groups, exquisite private groups, special designated vehicles and guidance etc.
A similar trend was also shown by Lvmama's booking data, as for the domestic long-distance travel, a "private deluxe tour" entertaining no more than 10 tourists with comfortable vehicles serving throughout the journey is becoming more popular than in previous years.
The Spring and Autumn Tourism's data has indicated that its consumers prefer the "easy and slow" tour with emphasis on experience, service quality and differentiation.
According to the data from Flying Pigs, gross bookings from tourists in the cities of the fourth tier and below have seen the fastest growth, with a year-on-year growth rate of 30%, reflecting the consumption upgrade of household residents in more regions of the country.
Personalization is a major feature of the "National Day" Golden Week tourism this year.
According to Ctrip data, car-rental orders for self-driven tours during the National Day holiday are expected to increase by nearly 60% year-on-year, and short-distance self-driven tours to explore the surrounding niche routes continue to gain popularity; the number of private deluxe tour registrants has increased by 155% year-on-year.
Sharing the happiness has become the main purpose of people's travel and recreation activities.
Ctrip data showed that 28 percent of National Day holiday tourists are parents and children, 25 percent are couples, and 23 percent are colleagues and friends.
In terms of the tourist's age, more than 50 percent of them are born in the 1980s and 1990s.
It is noteworthy that, unlike the faster growth of outbound travels during the past Golden Weeks, the domestic travel market has shown a more "eye-catching" performance this year.
The number of people booking domestic cultural tourism routes during National Day holidays this year has increased 42 per cent year on year, outpacing the growth of outbound travel, according to data from Flying Pigs.
Industry analysis believes that while the demand goes strong, reforms on the tourism supply side will be carried out all over the country in order to bring tourists a richer diversity of "cultural tourism feasts."
For example, the General Administration of Sport and the Ministry of Culture and Tourism have jointly released the "2019 Golden Week Sports Tourism Quality Routes". The on-going 2019 Shanghai Tourism Festival is launching seven sections with 100 cultural tourism activities to attract Chinese and foreign tourists. As the Golden Week approaches, Henan, Zhejiang, Hunan, Shandong and other provinces have offered discounted tickets or taken free measures in scenic spots.
Ctrip booking data has showed that destinations with unique natural scenery or cultural characteristics are the most "heated" targets in China, and Chongqing, Wuhan, Hangzhou, Xi'an, Chengdu, Guangzhou, Beijing, Shanghai, Nanjing and Tianjin will be the most popular domestic tourist destinations.

The oldest barber in the world died at 108 years old, after 96 years of cutting hair.
Anthony Mancinelli in New York, who made it into the Guinness Book of World Record for being the oldest practicing barber, had never retired and insisted on cutting hair every day until 108. He passed away due to jaw cancer on 19th and ended his 96-year career as a barber.
As ported by CNN, Mancinelli immigrated to the United States at 8 years old. He soon began sweeping floors at a barber shop, then cutting hair at 12 to help support his family.
He attended grade school at that time but never graduated.
Mancinelli’s son Robert said that Mancinelli loved his job and people around the world loved him. Mancinelli was healthy for most of his life until he was diagnosed with cancer in February of this year. About six weeks before his death, Mancinelli didn't feel well and quit working. Yet that was not retirement as he planned to return to work after recovery.
Robert said that he got to find a barber now after the death of his father, who has had his hair cut by his father for all 82 years of his life.
Repurchases of Listed Companies Hit a Record High of Over 100 Billion Chinese Yuan - Xinhua Net
In the past two years, China's listed companies have conducted share repurchases frequently in order to stabilize the company's stock price and maintain the company's reputation. Through targeted repurchases and call auction, they hoped to pass on the information that the companies' value was underestimated, so as to stabilize the stock price and enhance investors' confidence.
According to Choice Data, a data brand under East Money Information Co Ltd., in 2017, listed companies repurchased their stocks at 7.9 billion yuan and the amount surged to 51 billion yuan in 2018. Since 2019, the total amount of share repurchases conducted by listed firms on China's A-share market has exceeded 100 billion yuan, which hit a record high and was far more than the amounts in previous years.
From the perspective of the purpose of repurchases, the repurchased stock of listed companies seemed to be the same as the shareholding increase of majority shareholders, but there are significant differences in many aspects, including the implementing subject, the source of funds, the purpose of repurchases and the equity of stocks.
During the interview, Xu Yang, Chairman of Shanghai Macro Information Consulting Co, told the reporter from Securities Daily that problems such as the narrow scope of share repurchases, the complex decision-making procedures and the incomplete inventory system had been fixed in the Opinions on Supporting the Repurchase of Shares by Listed Companies issued in November 2018. Companies showed a rising appetite for buying back their own shares that year because the policy had been encouraging listed companies to conduct share repurchases.
In January this year, the Shanghai Stock Exchange and Shenzhen Stock Exchange officially issued the Detailed Rules for the Repurchase of Shares by Listed Companies. The issuing of the policies helped increase sources of funds for repurchases, appropriately simplified the implementation procedures, guided and improved governance arrangements and encouraged listed companies to conduct equity incentives or employee stock ownership plans.
After the issuing of the Opinions, share repurchases can be conducted by listed companies under more circumstances. The repurchase process has become simpler and the appetite for buying back shares has also become bigger.
Repurchasing shares at a relatively low price also helps listed companies improve the efficiency of capital use, thus increasing the level of profit earned per share and the rate of return on net assets and reducing the pressure on the company’s profitability indicators.
Compared with the increase in shareholdings by major shareholders, share repurchases by listed companies has a greater significance. Additionally, it also reflects the willingness of listed companies to actively manage market value and abundant cash flow.
Xu Yang believed that the underestimation of stock prices was the main factor for listed companies to conduct share repurchases. The company's stock price could no longer reflect the company's future development. Therefore, such companies were worth investors' attention. However, investors should pay more attention to the financial reports and operating conditions of those listed companies instead of making an investment blindly.
Conducting a huge amount of share repurchases has at least showed the confidence in future development and financial power of a listed company.
Listed firms on China's A-share market have shown a rising appetite for buying back their own shares. This helped normalize repurchase behavior. Data showed that almost 1,000 listed companies have completed their share repurchases this year. Leading companies in different industries have become the main force in the repurchase market.
China Ping An Insurance Company disclosed the progress of the repurchase, saying that the company has repurchased 57.59 million shares of A-shares through call auction, accounting for 0.315 percent of the company’s total capital stock. The total fund paid was 5 billion yuan, excluding transaction costs. The repurchased shares will all be used for employee stock ownership plans, including but not limited to the long-term service plan that has been reviewed and approved by the company's general meeting of shareholders.
China's dairy giant Yili has paid 5.792 billion yuan for shares repurchases and has adjusted the use of repurchase shares lately, from the original plan of "using all repurchased shares as the source of stocks for future implementation of equity incentives" to "having 183 million shares of cumulative repurchases with 152 million shares for stock incentives and 30.49 million shares for the cancellation to reduce registered capital."
Yili said that the cancellation of some of the repurchased shares would help further increase the level of profit earned per share and effectively increase the return on investment of the company's shareholders.
TCL Group issued a repurchase progress announcement on September 25th, showing that TCL Group had repurchased 3.59 percent of the company’s shares with 1.65 billion yuan.
The office of Board of Directors of TCL Group told the Securities Daily that the repurchased shares would be used for employee stock ownership plans, equity incentives or for the conversion of convertible corporate bonds issued by listed companies.
TCL Group will adhere to the established business strategy, continue to improve its competitiveness and maintain healthy development.
Based on the confidence in the company’s future development and the maintenance of investors’ interests, the company plans to conduct share repurchases with its own funds, self-raised funds and funds collected through other financing methods after reviewing the performance of the company's stock in the secondary market in the past year and taking the operating and financial conditions into consideration.
Qian Delong, Chief Economist of First Seafront Fund, said that the share repurchases of listed companies could not only significantly benefit the stock price of the secondary market by reducing the number of shares in the market and increasing the earnings per share of listed companies, but also greatly boost market confidence because listed companies would be willing to take out the real money and could buy back shares from the stock market to write off.
The repurchase of domestic listed companies has gradually increased in recent years, especially the repurchase of top-performing stocks. It is a very good way to boost investors' confidence through share repurchases and is also a practice worthy of recognition and encouragement.
The municipal party secretary of Changsha and standing committee member of Hunan provincial party committee Hu Henghua and four leaders in the construction machinery manufacturing in Hunan — — Zhan Chunxin, Liang Wengen, He Qinghua and Liu Feixiang, set up a “small target” about “Changsha, from engineering machinery to intelligent manufacturing” — — building the world-leading engineering machinery industrial cluster after three to five years.
To build the world-leading engineering machinery industrial cluster in Changsha, by using a buzzword, is to build “The Invincible.”
As the inland capital city, where does its confidence for the grandiloquence come from?
It is based on the dominant strength.
The four engineering machinery enterprises involved in this conversation are all powerful, covering all the fields of air, land and sea: SUNWARD’s light aircraft, Zoomlion’s concrete pump, Sany Heavy Industry’s all-terrain crane, and Railway Construction Heavy Industry’s shield tunneling machine for tunnel. Its “hard power” is unparalleled in the world.
Once upon a time, China barely had a voice in the field of construction machinery manufacturing
Times have changed since Chinese enterprises “brought in” and ”went out” the dual-wheel drive and took many measures including purchase, merging and building of factories with the help of the implementation of “the Belt and Road,” which made China become outstanding in the industry of engineering machinery.
Among them, the leading enterprises in the engineering machinery industry, such as Sany Heavy Industry, Zoomlion, Railway Construction Heavy Industry and SUNWARD, have preceded other similar enterprises in major economic indicators including production value, market share and sales.
It is based on the observation of various situations at different times.
The “Four Devarajas” of engineering machinery of Hunan are the star performers of the engineering machinery industrial cluster in Changsha and the leading enterprises of the global engineering machinery industry.
In the global industry, who can survive and live well will have a voice with confidence.
During the early years, the engineering machinery industry in the world was in recession. Many famous international enterprises in construction machinery manufacturing went bankrupt. Yet the construction machinery manufacturing enterprises in Changsha took this recession as a drill by adding pressure to themselves for self-breakthrough. Through the industrial structural transformation, they survived the recession and became more prosperous by transforming manufacturing into intelligent manufacturing.
It is based on the cooperation between the government and enterprises.
The development of competitive industries needs not only the enterprises’ efforts but also the government’s actions.
The reason why Changsha has a good reputation of “Capital of Engineering Machinery” is that it created a top-down full industry chain to build a number of correlated industrial clusters. By implementing many regulations and services such as optimizing business environments, improving the supporting service and simplifying approval processes, the cost of enterprises’ development, production and sales has been considerably reduced.
The good ecosystem of business makes many enterprises of construction machinery manufacturing come into being.
The history has promoted Changsha to the position for building the world-leading engineering machinery. Time waits for no man, and it is time to make a difference.
No matter the government, enterprises or even the relevant production research, should seize and take advantage of the opportunity, focus on the target, and keep on making efforts to contribute the strength from Hunan to building the manufacturing power.

At present, Africa faces the threat of terrorism and extremism. Only by solving the security issues can Africa truly realize a long-term peaceful development.
Looking forward to further coordinating the stances and increasing the solidarity and cooperation with China at the Security Council.
Wang Yi said that an important consensus had been reached at today’s meeting.
We all support the maintenance of multilateralism, the reinforcement of the authority and role of the UN, the maintenance of the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, and the opposition to unilateralism and bullying; We all agree to strengthen the mutual support and cooperation between China and Africa in the affairs of the UN and Security Council, and to safeguard the common interests of China and Africa, as well as other developing countries; We all support that African countries should solve their problems in their own way, and request the financial support from the UN for the independent peace operations of Africa; We all support the idea of “Cooperation facilitates development, and development boosts peace”, helping African countries achieve sustainable development independently; We all firmly safeguard the legitimate rights of developing countries and oppose any nation creating barriers to developing countries and depriving of their rights to achieve development.
Qingyang, Gansu Province: Hu sheep brought the bible of shaking off poverty.
Loess Plateau is tinged with autumn colors of September.
In the Yimin Professional Husbandry Cooperative, the 58-year-old Xia Weili filled up the manger with the last shovel of hay and stood there, watching the white sheep slowly chewing it.
"Enjoy, and put on plenty of good fat in autumn and winter. Then you'll sell a good price when you're taken out."
Xia Weili said he fed his sheep with "special nutritious meals" every day, cleaned and disinfected the sheepfold regularly, and did his best to takes care of them.
Xia Weili has been raising sheep for more than 20 years, but he hasn't realized how crude his methods were until he started to work in the cooperative.
Xia Weili comes from Xialaochi Village, Yima Town, Qingcheng County, Qingyang City, Gansu Province.
All his neighbors are sheep farmers, but they used the traditional free-range method, which only produced sheep of poor quality and quantity.
Everything started to change in June, when 140 households in poverty in the village joined the cooperative under the guidance of the government.
Xia Weili spent all the day studying husbandry, because he had his resolutions.
Those who joined the cooperative were all in poverty. They entrusted their sheep to the cooperative and counted on him to get a good price and receive dividends at the end of the year.
Thanks to the guidance of the specialists, he gradually learned to prevent diseases and to feed the sheep in a scientific way, which made him one of the "experts" in the village.
Yimin Professional Husbandry Cooperative is a standardized cooperative with 16 sheep barns and nearly 1,400 Hu sheep.
The director of the cooperative Zou Tao said that there were tricks everywhere in a standardized sheep barn.
He said, "Wool is thick and prone to grow bacteria. Hu sheep can't be left in a hot, dark, and humid place. The barn must be built on somewhere with grooves surrounding from three sides and with ventilation fans to remove the heat."
He also said, for disease prevention, the barns must be sprayed and disinfected regularly, and the sheep should be vaccinated three to four times every season.
In addition to a good living environment of the "fat little sheep," they should also be fed with a mixture of corn silage, wheat straw, alfalfa, etc., and be kept in a "playground" that is big enough for them to exercise.
The cooperative functions as a trustee that encourages local farmers to entrust their good breeds of sheep to the cooperative for unified breeding, management, and selling in order to ensure improved, scientific, standardized and intensive animal farming.
Each of the 140 households with shares in the cooperative now gets a dividend of more than RMB 6000 every year. Four people who are registered as living below the poverty line work at the cooperative.
The sheep farming in Qingyang, Gansu, has transformed from "grazing all over the hill" to "precision feeding," from "local mating" to "artificial insemination," and from the "examination of the body shape and belly" to "B-scan one by one." Moreover, the collaboration mode of "leading enterprises + cooperatives + farmers" has revolutionized the old way of "raising on the hillside and selling in the market" and resolved the problems of the traditional sheep farming that is weak, small-sized and dispersed. Farmers who used to live in poverty are living a better life because of modern sheep farming.
According to Zou Tao, if the market price is low, the local leading enterprise Gansu Zhongsheng Agriculture and Husbandry Development Company Limited will buy the sheep at the market protection price of RMB 27 per kilo to help reduce farmers’ risks.
Xu Jianfeng, the consultant of Zhongsheng Agriculture and Husbandry Development Company Limited, said the enterprise encouraged more and more households in poverty to read the bible of sheep farming by offering various services such as loan guarantees, breeding supplies, customized breeding, quote-and-buy, unified processing and selling, etc.
In Qingyang, at least 8200 households in poverty are receiving steadily increasing income by taking part in hay making, seed stock breeding, large-scale farming, slaughtering and cutting, and market sales organized by Zhongsheng.
Qingyang is located in a farming-pastoral zone in the north that is rich in forage resources.
There are 913 large-scale sheep barns and cooperatives with more than 5 million sheep and two processing lines with the slaughtering and cutting capacity of 1.3 million sheep, making sheep farming the leading business for poverty alleviation in the city.
French Finance Minister claims a tax deduction of over 10 billion euros and calls on Germany to follow up.
Paris (Reuters) September 26 - French Finance Minister (Bruno Le Maire) said on Thursday that France will deduct over 10 billion euros next year (equals to 10.9 billion US dollars), and Germany should follow up this step of fiscal stimulus to revive the downturn economy.
In his introduction of the financial budget of France in 2020, Le Maire claimed that the latest monetary easing measures implemented by the European Central Bank had created an opportunity to increase investment for the EU member states that can afford it.
The European Central Bank cut their interest rate to the lowest record on September 12 and planned to restart purchasing debt, so as to drive down the borrowing costs, hoping to stimulate economic recovery and boost the inflation rate.
“Low interest rate will not help Europe to resume prosperity, monetary measures are very necessary but not enough,”Le Maire told the reporters.
“Germany needs to make investment. They need it now, the earlier the better. Don’t wait until the situation gets worse to take actions,” Le Maire added.
He has made such appeal to Germany for several times.
This year, France has implemented tax cuts in excess of 10 billion euros and it has brought a big boost to the economic growth of the country.
However, when the global economy lost its momentum, the economy of Germany bears the brunt because it depends on export.
Le Maire pointed out that the French family tax burden will reduce 9.3 billion euros next year. This includes an income tax relief of 5 billion euros.
In addition, with the gradual fulfillment of the corporate tax rate deduction from 33.3% to 25% within 5 years, corporate tax burden will be reduced by nearly 1 billion euros.
The General Secretary of Chinese Communist Party, Xi Jinping, recently made important instructions about the protection of the memorial facilities of martyrs. He stressed the importance of the reinforcement the planning, construction, repairing，management and maintenance work within martyrs' ceremonies.
To implement in depth the instructions of the General Secretary and push forward the protection and management of the memorial facilities of martyrs, the General Office of the CPC Central Committee, the General Office of the State Council, and the General Office of the Central Military Commission issued The Overall Work Plan for the Management and Maintenance of the Planning, Construction, Repair and Maintenance of the Martyr Memorial Facilities a few days ago.
The Overall Work Plan serves as the programmatic document to guide the protection and management of the memorial facilities of martyrs. The Plan is explicit about the target tasks for the protection and management work. It requires that the memorial facilities of martyrs should be well planned and constructed, and the Red Education system should be improved so as to promote heroic spirits; the memorial facilities should be well repaired and protected to create the atmosphere of respecting heroes and remembering their merits; the facilities should also be well managed and maintained, and a normative as well as self-contained system of organization, support and management should be formed.
The Plan guides to enhance the repairing and protection of the memorial facilities of martyrs on the basis of the overall arrangement and long-term vision. To practically carry forward the work, the Plan points out the necessity to improve the leadership mechanism, policies and regulations; to organize and implement the quality improvement projects, to upgrade facilities and equipment, and to strengthen service ability; to increase the overall performance by optimizing exhibition contents and inaugurate new exhibition methods.
The Plan stresses to improve the regulation system and the organizational support. It stresses to intensify the organizational leadership by establishing a working mechanism led by the Ministry of Veterans Affairs, actively cooperated by the concerned departments, and widely participated by the whole society; to implement the law of martyr protection, improve the regulation-making system, and persistently advance the institutionalization, standardization and specialization of the planning, construction, management and maintenance of martyrs memorial facilities; to strengthen the team building by introducing volunteer service and by encouraging the active participation of veterans, families of martyrs, experts, scholars and young students into the interpretation and order maintenance of martyr memorial facilities; and to improve the social participation mechanism according to the government-led and multiple sources of investment principle, by actively advocating and encouraging enterprises, social organizations and individuals to provide donations and support for the repair and protection of martyr memorial facilities.
Study: U.S. national healthy diet index increases slightly, but still face challenges-ECNS
ECNS, September 27. According to a report by uschinapress.com, a recent study in the United States has shown that the U.S. government's healthy diet index has grown moderately from 56 to 58 in the past 16 years.
Considering that a maximum score is 100, this is no cause for celebration.
Americans still face "significant challenges" in their diets.
One of the authors of the study, Dr. Zhang Fangfang, a nutrition researcher at Tufts University in Massachusetts, said that Americans still consume too much food that may cause heart disease, diabetes, obesity and other diseases, which are the most common diseases of American citizens are suffering.
The research was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association on the 24th.
The study is based on the conclusions of a health survey of 44,000 adults conducted by the US government from 1999 to 2016.
"Despite considerable improvement, significant dietary challenges still exist," the authors write.
It is reported that these challenges include allowing US nationals to reduce their intake of snacks, hot dogs, beef cattle, butter and other foods containing saturated fats.
The study found that people's daily dietary intake of these unhealthy fats has increased from 11.5% to 12%, exceeding the recommended upper limit of 10%.
The biggest improvement in the American diets is the reduction of sugar intake from 16% to about 14%, but the intake remains still too high.
Officials believe that the daily intake of added sugar should be less than 10%.
The researchers believe that the reason for the reduction in intake of sugar has been linked to the reduction of people drinking sweet soda, but Zhang Fangfang emphasized that sugar is often added to even less sweet foods, such as yogurt and tomato sauce.
Adults in the United States have seen a slight increase in their intake of fruits, nuts, oats and other whole grain foods.
However, 2016 data shows that these foods still make up less than 5 percent of the daily diet.
Although people's intake of salt is slightly reduced, drinking less fruit juice has led to the intake of low-quality carbohydrates, Zhang Fangfang said that they still account for up to 42% of daily calories, much of which comes from refined white bread and other refined grains.
This study is based on personal health surveys that take place every two years, which will ask adults to recall what kind of foods they ate in the past 24 hours.
The health surveys have been asking this question twice every few days since 2003.
The government's dietary guidelines for American citizens recommend the people to adopt a "healthy diet pattern” to reduce the risk of chronic diseases.
The guidelines point out that people should consume more nutrient-dense foods such as vegetables, fruits, whole grains, low-fat dairy products, as well as seafood, lean meat, poultry, eggs, and seed foods that can provide proteins.
During the research, the number of people with diabetes in the United States has nearly doubled to more than 7%, and the obesity rate has also increased over the years in between the surveys; about 70% of American adults are now overweight or obese.
In addition, heart disease remains the leading cause of death in the United States.
The EU is promoting a strategic partnership with Asia.
Nguyen Van Binh, Member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of Vietnam Central Committee, Member of the Secretariat of the CPV Central Committee and Head of the CPV Central Committee Department for Economic Affairs, led a delegation to attend the forum.
Based on the close cooperation between the EU and its partners in the Asia-Pacific region, the forum was given a theme of "EU-Asia Connectivity Forum - Building Bridges for a Sustainable Future".
The forum will be held a year after the implementation of the strategy for EU-Asia connectivity.
European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said that strengthening connectivity was part of the proposition because it would benefit the people and economies in related countries.
The relations will help bring stability and prosperity to all countries concerned.
He also believed that the EU hoped to share an idea of promoting participation and strengthening mutually beneficial relationship between Europe and Asia.
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will deliver a keynote speech at the plenary session as a special guest of the forum.
Wealth management subsidiary of China's first joint-stock commercial bank established, technology applied to promote asset management business
On the 26th, China Everbright Bank(CEB) set up its wholly-owned subsidiary Everbright Wealth Management Co. Ltd. in Qingdao, China's eastern Shandong province, making CEB the first joint-stock bank to set up a unit to manage wealth management products (WMPs).
Experts said that asset management is an important field for the development of financial technology. The establishment of a wealth management subsidiary would be beneficial for a bank to use technology to enhance its asset management business.
In April this year, CEB and China Merchants Bank(CMB) issued announcements respectively, saying that they had been approved by the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission to prepare for the establishment of wealth management subsidiaries.
On September 24th, CEB announced that Everbright Wealth Management had officially been approved to open.
In just two days, CEB became the leader of many joint-stock banks by establishing Everbright Wealth Management in Qingdao.
Chairman of Everbright Group Li Xiaopeng said that Everbright Group would accelerate innovation. By using modern technological thinking and methods, relying on big data, Internet of Things, cloud computing, Everbright Group would increase the coverage, utilization and penetration rate of financial capital and improve clients' senses of acquisition, happiness and security.
By 2021, China will establish and improve the framework of China's development of financial technology, further develop the application of technology in the financial industry, achieve deep integration and coordinated development of finance and technology and significantly enhance people's satisfaction with digital, network-based and intelligent financial products and services.
Chairman of Everbright Wealth Management Zhang Xuyang introduced that new technologies such as intelligent investment advisers, intelligent investment research and big data would be applied to the asset management platform of Everbright Wealth Management and would help Everbright Wealth Management to make a better judgement on the macroeconomic situation.
In the future, Everbright Wealth Management will use new technologies such as blockchain to grasp the developing direction and trend from traditional assets to alternative assets, then to digital alternative assets.
Dong Ximiao, special researcher of the National Institution for Finance and Development, said that the asset management industry was facing new competitions and cooperations. Therefore, fin-tech companies and asset management institutions would explore new ways of development by using new related technologies.
Financial technology promotes the development of the asset management industry, This will not only meet the need for the transformation and development of financial technology, but also bring new vitality and energy to the development of asset management business.
Early this year, JD Digital Technology Holding Co. Ltd. launched a new asset management technology system, which could promote the research and development of asset management products and improve the ability to control risks with the help of technological and digital methods.
The new system helps enhance the overall level of intelligent operation of the asset management industry with the abilities to design products, conduct sales and trading process, manage assets and assess risks.
Experts believed that the application of asset management technology would not only help provide better services and more innovative products for clients, but also improve the ability to prevent risks and the efficiency of asset management.
Zhang Xuyang said that in the past, questionnaires had been used to obtain clients' risk appetite, but the result may not be accurate. The use of artificial intelligence in user portraits would help define a client, launch products according to clients' investment preferences and resolve risks.
"Alternative big data such as e-commerce and spatio-temporal data can help us better characterize the liveliness and prospect of a region or an industry."
Zhang Xuyang said that in addition to risk resolving, big data could also help improve the ability to control risks.
The record for the deepest shaft in China's railway tunnels has been broken
Baoshan, China News Service, September 27 (Zhang Weiming, Xu Weiguo, Zhou Jingbo) After more than 1,200 days of overnight constructions, the excavation and masonry of Gaoligongshan Tunnel No.1 shaft of the Dali-Ruili Railway which is still under construction has been completed on the 27th. Under the circumstances that there was a massive water inrush, they had claimed the record for the deepest shaft construction in China's railway tunnels by reaching a new depth of 762.59 meters below the ground.
Located in Yunnan province, the 34.5km Darei Railway Gaoligongshan Tunnel crosses the Gaoligong mountains from the west bank of the Nujiang River, making it the longest single-hole two-track tunnel in Asia.
This tunnel traverses 19 fault zones and has a maximum burial depth of 1155 meters. Because it covers almost all the poor geological conditions and major risks that a tunnel construction may encounter, Gaoligongshan Tunnel is called the "geological museum" of tunnel construction.
As the most important auxiliary tunnel of Gaoligongshan Tunnel, the shaft is responsible for increasing the operation areas to realize the important task of "building a long tunnel by means of driving from construction entries" and the ventilation of railway operation in a later stage.
Shaft No.1 has been successfully excavated to the very bottom, marking that Gaoligongshan Tunnel has officially entered into the stage of horizontal tunnel construction. After completing the excavation of the shaft station and replacing the necessary equipment, four additional operating areas can be added under the shaft to speed up the excavation of the main tunnel.
"The vertical shafts are all in granite formations. Because there are many fractures in the granite formations, the water cannot stop flowing from top to bottom. Basically, the pressure is as deep as the shaft goes."
Si Jingzhao, the chief engineer of the Darui Railway Project Department of China Railway Tunnel Bureau, told reporters that during the construction of the shaft there were many dangers such as muddy water inrush and collapses. The construction contractor had invited the experts to inspect and review on the spot and discuss the solutions more than 20 times.
"At its peak, the maximum water inflow gushing in the shaft reached over 300 cubic meters per hour. At the bottom of the 700-meter-deep shaft, the water pressure was equivalent to the sea floor at a depth of 700 meters".
Si Jingzhao said, "If drainage is not done in time, the shaft will be flooded 10 meters every hour. We spend almost 85% of our time on water control and 15% of the time on tunneling".
In order to overcome geological problems such as the development of longitudinal joints in surrounding rocks of No.1 shaft, bursts of muddy water, water-rich granite, and other geological problems, a series of water control measures combined with "exploration, injection, and excavation" are taken in tunnel construction to reduce the construction risk.
With many improvements, mechanized assembly lines such as excavation system, ballast discharging system, suspension system and winch lifting system have been set up in the construction of No.1 shaft, realizing the full-flow mechanized operations such as drilling, blasting, ballast discharging, formwork installation and concrete pouring, thus speeding up the construction progress.
In the end, after more than 1,200 days and nights of construction, the shaft was successfully excavated to a depth of 762.59 meters.
The Darui Railway, with a total length of 330 kilometers, is an important part of the China-Myanmar International Corridor and an important transportation infrastructure for the implementation of the "Belt And Road" construction.
After it is completed and put into service, the driving time from Dali to Ruili will be shortened from 6 hours to 2 hours on the current highway, which will greatly improve the transportation pattern in the western Yunnan region and play an important role in promoting economic and trade cooperation as well as the friendly exchanges between China and South Asian and Southeast Asian countries.
Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor: the Chinese people should be proud of the country's achievements
Press circles of Hong Kong celebrated the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
Reception to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China was held by the press circles on the 27th in Hong Kong.
Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor addressed the reception. She said that "China's achievements in the past 70 years are obvious to all. We are all proud of it as a Chinese."
Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor, Deputy Director of the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government (LOCPG) in the Hong Kong Lu Xinning, Deputy Commissioner of the Office of The Commissioner of The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of The People's Republic Of China in The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Song Ru'an, Deputy Political Commissar of the PLA garrison in Hong Kong Chen Yading and Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Preparation Committee of Hong Kong Press Circles Celebrating to the National Day Jiang Zaizhong were invited as guests to the reception.
Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor pointed out that China has been bravely moving forward and making progress and has overcome several difficulties and challenges. China's achievements in the past 70 years are obvious to all. The Chinese people should all be proud of it.
Hong Kong has been sticking together, making progress and sharing fruits with the mainland of China ever since its return to the motherland.
She believes that by implementing the principles of "One Country, Two Systems", Hong Kong will make the most of its advantages, grasp the opportunities brought by the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area and seek for a better future.
She also said that social disputes have never stopped in Hong Kong in the past few months. The situation has been affecting every single person in Hong Kong. People working in press circles are also facing challenges.
At this special time, she hopes that friends in the press circles can press forward in face of difficulties and be professional so as to provide fair and reasonable news reports for the society and bring rational communication back to Hong Kong for the region's bright future.
Jiang Zaizhong pointed out that China's glorious past is also Hong Kong's past when the region developed, made progress and shared weal or woe with the motherland.
This is especially true after Hong Kong's return to the motherland. The central government has been fully and faithfully implementing the principles of "One Country, Two Systems", "Hong Kong people administering Hong Kong" and a high degree of autonomy. Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland have stuck together for a common cause, kept watch for and helped defend one another, reached a mutual benefit and win-win situation and achieved great success in economic development.
Therefore, the Hong Kong press circles had this happy gathering to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China together.
He said that in the past three months, there had been so much violence in Hong Kong. People broke the law and destroyed social stability blatantly. Many news media bendt the truth and published misleading reports, which actually added fuel to the fire.
He appeals to the media to drive out evil and usher in good and create a good environment where people resist violence and defend laws.
Professionals in the press circles should conform to the norms, lead citizens away from violence with true reports and responsible words and defend the dignity and justice of the law.
Around 500 people from the press circles and other walks of life attended the reception. They all toasted the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China along with the main guests.
According to the Publicity Ministry of the Municipality Party Committee of Xining, the city will implement "Regulations for promoting civilized behavior in Xining" from October 1, focusing on 15 types of uncivilized behavior such as ignoring the traffic lights and throwing objects from inside a building. The new regulations list key issues to be dealt with and state corresponding punishment.

Family from UK trapped in France for five days after the car key fell into a lake
A couple from Wales were trapped in France with their two children for five days during their vacation in France. Their car key fell into a lake accidentally and it took them five days to get a new key from the car producer.
The couple then left France with the two kids.
According to the news report, on September 16th local time, the family were rowing a boat on a lake in France when the daughter knocked over a bag and the car key fell into the lake.
They spent hours looking for the key but ended up finding nothing.
All their belongings and cash were locked in the car.
Although they had bought insurance before coming to France, the insurance company refused to help because they believed that car was not in danger of being stolen.
This left them no choice but to hire a truck to tow the car to an auto repair workshop and order a new key from the car producer.
A few days later, they got the new key and were finally able to leave France.
Unfortunately, all their bookings on the trip were canceled due to the loss of the key.

Carry out a pilot program to apply the system of notification and commitment to licensing low-risk food production and delegate the power of representative offices of foreign enterprises to the Free Trade Zone
On the 27th, the Market Supervision and Regulation Bureau of Shanghai Municipality signed a working memorandum with the People's Government of Pudong New Area to introduce 20 reform measures relating to market supervision and regulation. Some of the measures will be firstly piloted nationwide.
It is introduced that the system of notification and commitment requires the administrative authority to notify the applicant of conditions and requirements in laws and regulations in a written form when handling license registrations.
After the applicant signs the commitment, the administrative authority may directly handle the registration.
According to the memorandum, the Market Supervision and Regulation Bureau of Shanghai Municipality will support the Pudong New Area and Shanghai Pilot Free Trade Zone in carrying out a pilot program to apply the system of notification and commitment in three areas including the registration of the name of enterprises, licensing simply processed food and low-risk food production and giving approval to some types of measurement instruments, in order to provide enterprises with easier market access.
Shanghai Shao Wansheng Food Co., Ltd. obtained a Food Production License immediately through the system of notification and commitment on the 27th and became the first enterprise to enjoy the pilot dividend.
The head of the company said that a Food Production License can be issued immediately on the day of applying. Enterprises are even allowed to submit only part of the materials specified in the plan of the system of the notification and commitment within a time limit. "We do feel the convenience brought by the reform. "
The Market Supervision and Regulation Bureau of Shanghai Municipality said that the implementation of the notification and commitment system for the food production license is the first pilot in the country.
After the reform, the examination and approval process has been reduced from the previous six processes of "registration, acceptance, on-site verification, sampling examination, material review and approval and licensing" to four processes of "registration, acceptance and approval and licensing". All the processes can be handled in one day compared with the previous 20 working days.
Pudong has a highly export-oriented economy. Taking this into consideration, the Market Supervision and Regulation Bureau of Shanghai Municipality delegate the power of permanent representative institutions of foreign (regions) enterprises to the Free Trade Zone, so that enterprises can choose to obtain a license nearby.
Statistics show that 1,592 permanent representative institutions in the Free Trade Zone are involved in the delegation of power in total and 99 of the institutions have handled the service in accordance with the new regulations.
Survey on China's National Day holiday consumption: people are having more choices, but tourism is the most popular
With the National Day holiday, or the "golden week", approaching, people are finalizing their plans.
A reporter from Securities Daily conducted a survey on people's National Day holiday plan in WeChat's Moments and received 20 feedbacks. People are having different plans, but "travel + shopping" has become the keyword for the National Day holiday.
To be specific, half of the people choose to go on a trip during the holiday according to the survey carried out by the reporter from Securities Daily.
Mr Liu, who lives in Tianjin, said that "The whole family is planning to go to Shanghai during the National Day holiday. We made Shanghai Disneyland our first stop before travelling to neighbouring cities." Ms Li, who lives in China's capital Beijing, chooses to travel to China's Taiwan province with her family. "We three are planning to go on September 28th and spend ten days travelling all over the island," she said. aMs Ma from Chongqing makes a plan for outbound travel with Singapore as her destination. Mr Zhang from China's northern Hebei province plans for a road trip with his family. He said that "It will be quite difficult for us to travel far since my daughter's only one year old, so we're going to Shandong by car and spend a few days by the sea."
The Report on Residents' Travel Trends for the Golden Week of the National Day of 2019 issued jointly by online travel agencies Tongcheng Yilong and Tongcheng Travel shows that the consumption will witness an upgrade in the transportation, hotel and tourism industry during the golden week.
The marketing penetration rates of aeroplanes and high-speed railways are steadily growing. The needs for star hotels and non-standard accommodations, such as apartments, inns and B&Bs, account for a higher percentage of all needs for accommodations.
The 2019 China’s Tourism Consumption Trends for the National Day Golden Week issued by China's leading e-commerce platform for services Meituan on September 23th shows that tourism consumption remains high and food, accommodation, transportation and entertainment consumption are all upgrading.
More young people prefer quality tourism and special experiences. Cultural tourism and night tourism are becoming more popular.
Besides, consumer demand is also going to grow during the National Day holiday.
Mr Wang from Chengdu told the reporter from Securities Daily that "Buying a car is my main priority during the holiday."
An employee from a 4S car shop in Beijing told Securities Daily that usually, September to October is the "golden period" for car sales each year.
Bricks and mortar shops are going to launch sales promotions during the National Day holiday, such as lottery drawing and price reductions.
Moreover, many car companies have launched new models recently. It is estimated that this will significantly promote car sales.
People are now focusing more on satisfying spiritual needs, thus the increase in culture, education and other services consumption.
Ms Du from Beijing said that "Culture and education consumption has always accounted for a high percentage ever since the child was born."
Children are given so many plans during the National Day holiday, such as going to planetariums and children theatres. Several families are planning to pitch tents and go camping in the Elk Museum. Children are also going to attend some trial classes during the holiday.
Experts said that theoretically speaking, the consumption upgrade is a process of switching from surviving-target consumption to development-target consumption and enjoyment-target consumption. Service consumption accounts for a high percentage of enjoyment-target consumption.
With the growth in China's economy and people's income, people will focus more on spiritual-level consumption. Travelling is a good choice for them.
This is especially true during the National Day holiday when people are having more time to go travelling and shopping. This will not only meet the consumer demand but also reflect consumption upgrades.
I had felt lonely since the afternoon, but I didn’t want to go out. I hadn’t adjusted my state without my kids around me.
Bracing myself up, I said to my dog Nana: Mom will take you out.
I wrote down some things that need to be handled in detail. The characteristics of blood type A were increasingly obvious so that I even felt uncomfortable myself.
Picking up the suit, paying the bills, buying the nutrition caplets, raw fish and snacks for Nana.
The above is the reason for going out.
I just told my young sister Aiqiang on the phone that thanks to Nana, I had excuses to buy snacks.
She laughed perfunctorily and hung up because her kids were coming around.
Nana jumped in the passenger’s side deftly and got down quietly. She was scared of her carsickness, but she wanted to keep me company.
Unusually for my husband Boao, he came back very early.
He kept praising that the salad with salmon and avocado was tasteful and then watched television on the bed in the bedroom.
I looked at the clock on the wall, it was just seven. The land of the rising sun also had an early sunset. The sky had already gotten dark.
Friends were all posting the bright moon. It was mid-autumn.
I washed a bunch of grapes sent by friends and left half of them to Aobo. I put the other half into the bowl with floral prints that I liked and enjoyed them while watching the moon.
Sitting on the ground with Nana, I ate the grapes while she ate the skin. Then I put forth my strength to spit the seeds far away.
The moon hid in the cloud which was moving, so the moon was flickering and a bit dazzling.
I came up with many poems about the moon, but I only liked this line: Tis what time three meets five, selene is a globe! Her pure rays fill the court, the jade-like rails enrobe! Lo! In the heavens her disk to view doth now arise, and in the earth below to gaze men lift their eyes.
We might have endowed the moon with too much affection. For me now, actually, "Pay to Caesar what belongs to Caesar and God what belongs to God," might be the best.
Moonlight is moonlight, the mood belongs to yourself.
After having the grapes, I felt the coldness from the moon.
Nana was snoring slightly next to my feet. I stood up and put her little blanket beside her small house. Nana lied down happily on the blanket.
He pulled the door open and yelled: is the bath water ready?
I couldn’t see the moon from the window of bathroom, but I could feel the moonlight after turning off the light and opening up the window.
We didn’t have the mooncake or alcohol.

Will Malaysian Chinese Association run for the by-election of the seat of People's Assembly at Tanjung Piai in Johor?
The President of Malaysian Chinese Association Wee Ka Siong said: “We will leave it to the Supreme Court of National Front!”
The Tanjung Piai by-election for the Dewan Rakyat seat is around the corner, whether Malaysian Chinese Association which is the member party of National Front will be elected for this traditional seat of People's Assembly has been brought into focus.
However, the Central Committee of Malaysian Chinese Association held a conference and announced that they would leave the decision to the Supreme Court of National Front on whether the seat would be gained by Malaysian Chinese Association or other member parties.
After presiding over the conference of the Central Committee of Malaysian Chinese Association in the afternoon on Thursday, Wee Ka Siong told the media that the National Front would base any by-elections on the standard operation procedure (SOP). That is, it cannot be decided until the conference is held by the Supreme Court of National Front.
He said the conference of the Supreme Court of National Front is expected to take place at the beginning of October, because the Election Committee would not hold a conference to make decisions about relevant issues on Tanjung Piai by-election for the seat of People's Assembly until next Monday (1st).
“Yesterday (26th) morning, I also met with the chairman of the National Front Ahmad Zahid Hamidi, and we both agreed that we should regain this seat from Alliance of Hope.”
“We decided to hold a special conference for the leaders of the National Front at the beginning of October, and the chairmen of three Parties in the National Front decide which member party will be elected.”
When asked whether Malaysian Chinese Association would urge the Supreme Court of National Front to elect it, Wee Ka Siong reiterated that he would rely on the standard operation procedure as President of Malaysian Chinese Association, so they must reach a consensus with the National Front before making any decisions.
“It is commonplace for someone running for any by-elections and the political parties also think they should do that.”
“The most important is that to which organization and political union do we belong?”
“This will be a good test of our political union and we believe that the National Front has kept something valuable through the whole journey.”
“In this process, it is normal for someone to say something.”
“However, the most important is that we should try our best once the Supreme Court of National Front makes a decision.”
“Anyway, Wee Ka Siong expressed that Malaysian Chinese Association would spare no efforts to prepare for the coming Tanjung Piai by-election based on three levels, namely the District, Joint Committee of the State and the Center.”
“The District will be led by the Chairman of the (Tanjung Piai) District Wee Jeck Seng”; the Joint Committee of the State will be led by the Acting Chairman of the Johor Joint Committee Lin Peixing; the Center will be deployed by the Acting President of Malaysian Chinese Association Ma Hanshun and the Secretary General Zhang Shengwen.”
Last Saturday (21st), the senator of Malaysia United Indigenous Party of Tanjung Piai, Muhamad Farid Saad, died of a heart attack in Pontian Hospital at the age of 42.
A villager at Baokang County in Hubei was punished by “patrolling the mountains voluntarily” due to hunting wildlife.
A villager at Baokang County in Hubei was sentenced due to hunting wildlife. In the meanwhile, he was punished by losing 15420 Yuan (RMB, the same below) as the compensatory payment for repairing the ecological environment.
Since the defendant is poor, the procuratorial organs use labor camp to replace the compensatory payment for repairing the ecological environment, realizing the organic unity of legal and social effect.
On 27th, Wang Zhongliang, the vice procurator of Baokang County’s procuratorate, said that the defendant Mr. Zhou has build a deep emotional bond with the wild macaque and felt guilty about his previous action of hunting animals after “patrolling the mountains voluntarily” and other labors for three months.
In June 21 this year, a criminal and civil public benefit case on the field of ecological resources was initiated by Baokang County’s procuratorate and was put on public trial with the judgment being passed in court.
The defendant Mr. Zhou was sentenced to three years' imprisonment with four years’ probation and a penalty of 3000 Yuan. Meanwhile, he was punished by losing 15420 Yuan as the compensatory payment for repairing the ecological environment.
Through investigation, Mr. Zhou had started setting up the power grid in the mountains since January in 2014 and hunted more than 20 wild animals, including goral, muntjac and elaphodus cephalophus.
Goral is the second-class national protected wild animals that are endangered, while muntjac and elaphodus cephalophus are classified into the National Protection List of Terrestrial Wild Animals.
In the court trial, Mr. Zhou confess everything about his corpus delicti and was willing to take the additional civil responsibilities.
Given the poor economic condition of Mr. Zhou’s family, the local village committee, forestry depot and Mr. Zhou reached a tripartite agreement under the coordination of Baokang County’s procuratorate, using labor camp to replace the compensatory payment for repairing the ecological environment. That is, Mr. Zhou provides public services such as domesticating and looking after macaques at the conservation area of macaques, patrolling the mountains voluntarily, and protecting the forest for one year, to compensate for the cost of ecological remediation.
The court approved the proposal from the procurator and agreed that Mr. Zhou actively performs his duty to work as a compensation for the cost of ecological remediation during his probation.
So far, Mr. Zhou has voluntarily worked at the conservation area of macaques for three months with good performance in actively patrolling the mountains.
In recent years, Baokang County’s procuratorate has organically integrated procuratorial functions into social governance in practice through the scientific use of procuratorial suggestions, investigation supervision of proceedings and so on, minimizing the damage to ecological environment caused by criminal acts with the help of judicial measure.
Ant Forest was honored with the Champions of the Earth award by the United Nations
Amid warm applause and magnificent music, the Ant Forest project leader Xu Di and user representative Shen Junliang walked onto the podium to take over the trophy of the 2019 United Nations "Champions of the Earth" from the host's hands.
The "Ant Forest", a project that leveraged mobile applets to encourage hundreds of millions of people to participate in environmental protection activities, had been recognized in the "Inspiration and Action" category at the "2019 Champions of the Earth" award ceremony held in New York, USA on the 26th.
A week ago, the United Nations Environment Program had announced the list of winners at its headquarter in Nairobi, Kenya, but the people who participated in the award ceremony on that day were still unable to contain their excitement.
In an interview with Xinhua News Agency, Inge An Nuosheng, the Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Program, said, "Ant Forest" is an exciting innovation that enables hundreds of millions of people to take actions and understand the environmental challenges facing humanity and what humans can do for the environment.
By leveraging technology to connect people with the environment, it allows every individual to take part in the actions to protect planet earth, which will have a huge impact.
Launched by China Ant Financial Services Group (Ant Financial Services for short) on Alipay platform in August 2016, "Ant Forest" allows users to accumulate "green energy" and "plant virtual trees" in their mobile phones by taking low-carbon actions such as recording the green footprints in their daily lives, paying utility bills online etc.
Every time the user has developed a virtual tree, "Ant Forest" and its non-profit partners will plant a real tree in the desert area.
As of August this year, 500 million "Ant Forest" users had reduced carbon emissions by 7.92 million tons and planted 122 million trees in the desert areas.
In the "Champion of the Earth Awards" honored that day, Costa Rica had taken its reward for its national environmental efforts. The Costa Rica President Carlos Alvarado who came to receive the award hailed the contributions made by Ant Forest on the spot, which he said "is impressive to inspire so many people to take part in green actions."
Jing Xiandong, the chairman and chief executive officer of Ant Financial Service Group, said that the "Champion of the Earth Award " was a nod to the Ant Forest Initiative.
Technologies and open platforms made it possible for everyone to participate in the low-carbon life, and the honor belongs to all participants.
Jing Xiandong said that the "Ant Forest" has affected 500 million people in the past three years, and the goal of the "Ant Forest" in the next three years is to drive 1 billion people worldwide to participate in low-carbon actions.
While fighting against desertification and protecting the environment, they were also exploring ways to bring the farmers more earnings from green mountains and clear waters.
In addition to providing job opportunities of planting trees, they also wished to help farmers increase their income with agricultural product development projects and e-commerce platforms.
The model of public environmental protection created by Ant Forest based on digital technology has also been successfully launched out overseas and followed by other countries.
In June this year, the largest "electronic wallet" in the Philippines GCash had rolled out the Philippine version of "Ant Forest" to encourage Filipino users to better protect the environment through a low-carbon lifestyle.
According to reports, GCash will work together with the Philippine Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources and non-commercial environmental organizations to plant 365,000 trees in the territory of Philippines one year after the project is launched.
The Champions of the Earth is the United Nations' top-level environmental honor which is awarded once a year.
Ant Forest's winning of the award came in the third consecutive year that a green innovation initiative from China has been recognized in the "Incentive and Action" category, following the Saihanba Forestation Community Project and the Zhejiang Green Rural Revival Program in China.
Economic and trade friction affects the US economy
The report on the US economy in the second quarter of this year showed that the growth rate of the US gross domestic product (GDP) significantly slowed down from the previous quarter due to the huge decline in private sector investment and exports.
Analysts pointed out that the economic and trade friction and the uncertainties brought by it were the main factors behind the decline in private sector investment and exports in the second quarter.
The final revised data released by the US Department of Commerce on the 26th showed that the US GDP in the second quarter of this year grew at an annual rate of two percent, which was the same as the previously revised data, but was significantly lower than the 3.1 percent in the first quarter.
Data showed that consumption growth was the main contributor to US economic growth in the second quarter.
The personal consumption expenditure, which accounted for about 70 percent of the US economy, increased by 4.6 percent quarter-on-quarter, promoting economic growth by 3.03 percentage points.
Additionally, the government consumption expenditure and investment drove up the economy by 0.82 percentage points.
However, investment in private sectors dropped by 6.3 percent in the second quarter from the previous one, dragging down the economy by 1.16 percentage points in the quarter. Exports fell by 5.7 percent from the previous quarter and the net exports dragged the economy down by 0.68 percentage points in the quarter.
Barry Knapp, the managing partner at the US-based Ironsides Macroeconomics, said that investment in private sectors failed to maintain the growth rate of last year. Instead, it showed a sharp decline because of a lack of confidence in companies caused by the economic and trade friction and the rising uncertainties.
Knapp believed that due to the influence of uncertainty in policies, the capital expenditures of US enterprises were expected to continue to decline next year.
Analysts believed that consumption growth had become a strong support for the US economy in the second quarter, but there were more signs indicating that the economic and trade friction and the uncertainties caused had already affected consumer confidence and had brought negative impacts on the US consumer outlook.
Richard Curtin, head of the survey and a professor of economics at the University of Michigan, said that in the latest survey, 38 percent of the consumers spontaneously mentioned the negative impacts that tariffs had on the US economy. The proportion hit a new high in one and a half years.
Regarding the future of the US economy, analysts believed that it would continue to slow down.
However, there were also some experts saying that if the economic and trade friction were alleviated, the performance of the US industrial sector and the financial market would be better.
Cailin Birch, an economist of the Economist Intelligence Unit(EIU) predicted that in the future, the US economy would continue this year's downward trend and its growth rate would drop to a lower level compared with the rate in the second quarter.
Mark Zandi, the chief economist at Moody’s Corporation, predicted that if the economic and trade friction would not be more serious, the US economic growth rate this year would be 2.3 percent and would further slow down to 1.6 percent next year.
The investment manager of Putnam Investments pointed out that the biggest concern of enterprises was the economic and trade dispute and the uncertainty brought by it. If the dispute could be resolved, the uncertainty would be greatly reduced and the performance of the industrial sector would be much better.
Matt Maley, an equity strategist at Miller-Tabak Asset Management, said that the economic and trade friction is still the "primary problem" and the main reason for the large fluctuations in the US capital market this year. Whether the economic and trade friction can be properly resolved will be the key to the future of US capital markets in the rest of the year.
The parental leave is available to both husband and wife in Ningxia for the first time and parents whose children are at the age from 0 to 3 can take a ten-day leave every year
The guarantee of women’s legal rights reflects the respect and guarantee of human rights, as well as the important sign of development of social civilization.
On the 15th conference of the 12th National People’s Congress in September 27, The Regulation On The Protection Of Women's Rights And Interests in Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region was passed with an overwhelming majority of votes
This is the first local regulation formulated and issued by Ningxia at the provincial level to safeguard women’s legal rights in a systematic way. It will be officially implemented in November 1, 2019.
It is reported that the Regulation passed this time is a revision on the Ningxia’s Measures For The Implementation of The People’s Republic Of China’s Law On The Protection Of Women's Rights And Interests in 2007, which is divided into nine chapters and sixty-five items, including general principles, political right, right to cultural education, right to labor and social security, property right, personal right, marriage and family rights, legal liability, and supplementary principles.
In the Regulation, Ningxia encourages the exploration and implementation of entitling both husband and wife to take parental leave, which is unprecedented in the whole country.
In April this year, the General Office of the State Council issued The Guidance Of Improving Caring Services For Children Under The Age of Three has relevant description of the parental leave for both husband and wife.
When revising the Regulation, Ningxia innovatively proposed that “employers are encouraged to grant a ten-day parental leave to both husband and wife annually, as long as their fertility behaviors are legitimate and their children are at the age from 0 to 3.”
At the same time, Regulation highlights the anti-sexual harassment the protection for girls.
The 43rd item of the Regulation lists detailed rules on what constitutes sexual harassment and the main measures to prevent it based on the updated legislative achievements of Chinese Civil Code and Personal Rights.
The 44th item of the Regulation bans the vicious incident of sexual assault aimed at little girls that was frequently occurred and requires educational organizations to impart relevant information on protection and prevention to it, which becomes the new benchmark for local legislation to protect little girls.
Aiming at women’s rights to know and decide the joint estate of marriage and family, the 35th item in the Regulation clearly stipulates that women have the right to know the joint estate and property registration as well as the duty for related parties, providing firm institutional support for women to safeguard their legal right.
In addition, aiming at the social hot spot — — the gender discrimination at workplace, the 26th item of the Regulation not only bans direct discrimination but also indirect discrimination. Drawing on the updated practical experience of joint meeting, it reinforces effects of punishment for the criminal acts gender discrimination, firmly safeguarding women’s legal right.
In recent years, the organs of public security, procuratorate and court of the Women's Federation in Ningxia and civil administration departments have achieved remarkable success in employing social professions to mediate in the marriage and family conflicts and oppose the family violence,
The Regulation has summarized and improved based on it, with many items encouraging social mobilization and accumulation of social resources in order to safeguard women’s rights. It also requires people's government above the county level to provide stable and institutional support through purchasing services.
The salt-tolerant rice field at Hinggan League Yuan Longping Academician Workstation in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region produces over 1000 grams of rice
According to the Sub-provincial Administrative Office at Hinggan League in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region on 27th, reporters learned that there was great news from "Hinggan League Yuan Longping academician workstation salt-tolerant rice field yield acceptance council" held in the league one day ago: the average yield of the salt-tolerant rice was over 1000 grams per mu.
The expert group for measuring production, which is comprised of six experts from Heilongjiang Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Yangzhou University and Rural Administration of Agriculture in Hunan Province, took samples of the rice from “Hinggan salt series” on the spot.
Through the experts’ test, the average yield of the salt-tolerant rice was 508.8 kilograms per mu in the soil with PH value ranging from 8.8 to 9.6 and salinity ranging from 5‰ to 6‰.
The executive head of Hinggan League Yuan Longping Academician Workstation Wang Shigang said: “Our next step is to further innovate and reform based on the test this year, cultivating and optimizing the variety of salt-tolerant rice again to improve its quality and production. “
Lai Yongcai, the leader of the expert group for measuring production and the deputy dean and researcher from Heilongjiang Academy of Agricultural Sciences, said: “On the premise that production factors do not change, I think that the ability to tackle hard-nut problems in science and technology needs further improved so that the salt-tolerant rice will perform miracles again in the saline-alkali soil.
The Hinggan League is among the contiguous poor areas at the southern foothill of Great Khingan.
The Yuan Longping Academician Workstation was established on October 2018.
Yuan Longping academician led expert groups to enhance the import and generalization of advanced technology and the variety of newly-cultivated “hybrid salt-tolerant rice”, construct 960 mu of salt-tolerant rice base at Horqin Right Middle Banner, help local impoverished people increase both production and income as well as overcome their poverty and achieve prosperity by following the technical route of conducting experimental demonstration and generalization at the same time.
The field measure of salt-tolerant rice this time not only brings hope for Hinggan League to turn its low-productive saline-alkali field into high-productive field but also offers scientific evidence for the cultivation of rice in saline-alkali soil under the same condition.
According to the au123.com, after a marathon debate and weeks of protests, Australia's New South Wales has passed the bill to legalize abortions on September 26 local time.
It is reported that the bill has sparked political debate in the past eight weeks. Since the independent Member of Parliament Greenwich announced the introduction of the bill there have been deep divisions over this issue within the Australian Liberal Party.
The report said that after nearly 40 hours of discussions, the Senate of Australia's New South Wales voted 26 to 14 to pass the Abortion Legalization Bill in the evening of the 25th, making it the third longest reviewed bill in the New South Wales Senate.
On the morning of the 26th, after a final vote in the House of Representatives, abortions in New South Wales were legalized.
The bill allows women to terminate their pregnancy at the 22nd week of gestation, and a woman is also allowed to have an abortion later in the pregnancy if two doctors agree.
On the evening of the 25th, the Senate passed an amendment that doctors can seek advice from the multidisciplinary panel of the Hospital Advisory Committee before they perform abortions for women after 22 weeks of pregnancy.
In addition, the amendment passed by the Senate also included that doctors must provide proper care for babies who survived the termination of pregnancy.
Earlier, the premier of New South Wales, Gladys Berejiklian, had faced public criticisms over the bill from the conservatives. Gladys Berejiklian had attempted several times to intervene in order to gain more time for debate on the bill, but she did not attend the final vote."
Gladys Berejiklian defended her absentee vote: "I need to spend time managing the entire New South Wales."
It is reported that the Australian Liberal MP Davis was the strongest opponent to the abortion bill. He had once threatened to withdraw from the New South Wales government because of the bill, saying that the bill triggered a "government crisis."
But then, Davis made a concession.
Davis said: "The amendment to the abortion legalization bill that was submitted to the House of Representatives on the morning of the 26th actually provides more protections for women and doctors."
At the same time, Australian's New South Wales National Party leader Barillaro said he was proud to be a member of the government that legalized abortion.
"What we have achieved last night is of historical significance for New South Wales. By legalizing abortion, it is no longer a criminal act and women who have abortions will not be treated as criminals."

A total of 860.1 billion yuan of the state capital from 67 centrally-administered state-owned enterprises and central financial institutions has been transferred to social security funds, according to China's Minister of Finance Liu Kun.
On the 27th, China's Minister of Finance Liu Kun said that by now, a total of 860.1 billion Chinese yuan (about 121.6 billion U.S. dollars) of the state capital from 67 centrally-administered state-owned enterprises and central financial institutions has been transferred to social security funds.
Liu Kun made the above announcement at a meeting on implementing the plan for transferring part of state-owned capital to fortify social security funds jointly held by the Ministry of Finance (MOF), the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security (MOHRSS) and the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC).
"Transferring part of state-owned capital to fortify social security funds is an important step to reforming and improving China's old-age insurance plan. It also proves that China has achieved the intergenerational equity of the basic old-age insurance plan and is sharing the fruit of the development of state-owned enterprises with all people. The measure is based on present realities whilst taking future development into consideration."
In 2017, the State Council issues the Implementation Plan for Transferring Part of State-Owned Capital to Fortify Social Security Funds, deciding to pilot the measure in selected central and local state-owned enterprises.
China has now made positive progress in the first phase of replenishing social security funds with the state capital, said Liu Kun.
At the central level, a total of 860.1 billion yuan of the state capital from 67 centrally-administered state-owned enterprises and central financial institutions has been transferred to social security funds within three rounds.
Among all 67 enterprises and institutions, central financial institutions with MOF performing duties as the capital contributor have completed the transfer.
The replenishment work has been finished in a significant number of centrally-administered state-owned enterprises.
At the local level, earlier work has also started.
The pilot work of replenishment in Zhejiang province and Yunnan province has been basically completed, with 15.8 billion yuan and 18.5 billion yuan, respectively, having been transferred by the end of 2018, according to Liu.
On top of the pilot provinces, other provinces are also pushing forward their first-phase preparations, laying a solid foundation for the implementation of the transfer.
According to the notice issued jointly by MOF, MOHRSS, SASAC and the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), the work of replenishing social security funds with state capital at the central and local level begins in 2019 and shall be basically finished by the end of 2020.
The meeting made specific arrangements to implement the replenishment work.
The meeting stressed that the transfer work should be carried out in a pragmatic and efficient manner.
"Based on the arrangement, the transfer work shall be basically finished by the end of 2020."
"Massive tasks need to be done in a limited time."
Liu Kun said that relevant departments of all levels in all regions should push forward the work and complete the task as required. All departments should have a deep understanding about the transfer measure to do a solid job and improve communication and coordination to solve problems and difficulties as soon as possible.
Transferring part of state-owned capital to fortify social security funds: from "filling the pocket of social security funds" to providing strong support for the pension
However, the author believes that this is not a simple "physical displacement" of equity, but rather a "mathematical addition".
On September 20th, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, the State-Owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission, the State Taxation Administration and China Securities Regulatory Commission jointly issued the Notice on Carrying out the Implementation Plan for Transferring Part of State-Owned Capital to Fortify Social Security Funds to clarify the timetable for transferring part of state-owned capital to fortify social security funds. The plan is to carry out the transfer by the central and local governments in 2019.
After issuing the document, the Ministry of Finance and other departments have quickly implemented the plan.
On September 25th, the Ministry of Finance transferred 10% of its shareholding in Industrial and Commercial Bank of China(ICBC) and Agricultural Bank of China(ABC) to the National Council for Social Security Fund(SSF). The total value of the transferred equity exceeded 115 billion Chinese yuan.
According to the regulation, as financial investors, the undertaking entities such as SSF enjoy the right to earn, dispose and know in terms of the state-owned equity they receive.
ICBC and ABC stated in the announcement that the change in equity this time would not cause any changes in the banks' controlling shareholders and actual controllers.
Regarding this, the author believes that the transfer of the equity of a state-owned enterprise is not a simple change in equity ownership, but an "addition" that can lead to several effects.
The first "result of addition" after the transfer of some state-owned assets to social security funds is that a state-owned enterprise actually belongs to all people and the fruit of development is shared by all.
After years of reform and development, state-owned enterprises, especially central enterprises, are mostly in important industries and fields in the Chinese economy. Their overall profitability is relatively high and steady.
Among all state-owned enterprises, leading enterprises have been growing better, bigger and stronger in recent years.
On July 10th, the Executive Meeting of the State Council decided to fully promote the transfer of some of the state-owned capital to fortify the social security funds this year.
The Ministry of Finance immediately stated afterwards that they would work with relevant departments to fully promote the transfer of part of state-owned capital to fortify the social security funds in accordance with the deployment of the Executive Meeting of the State Council, fully achieve the intergenerational equity of the basic endowment insurance system and share the fruit of the development of state-owned enterprises with all people.
The second "result of addition" is that the transfer can enhance the sustainability of China’s social security fund and further consolidate the foundation of the old-age social security system.
Because of the aging process, China's social security fund is under pressure. Most of the state-owned capital to be transferred this time can continuously bring profits and dividends. This will not only supplement the social security fund effectively, but also provide a constant source for the social security fund.
Calculations showed that every 3.8-percentage-point transfer of state-owned capital could help reduce the rate of basic pension insurance contribution of enterprises by one percentage point.
The third "addition result" of transfer is adding a stabilizer to the capital market.
The undertaking entity of the transfer earns profits mostly from the dividend, supplemented by the operation.
As a financial investor in state-owned capital, the SSF does earn most of the profit from equity dividends.
However, as a value investor in the capital market, the SSF has strong capabilities of capital operation.
For listed assets of state-owned capital, the holding of shares of the SSF will further optimize the corporate governance structure of listed companies and help improve the companies' level of business operations, bringing positive impacts to listed companies and capital markets.
Moreover, the SSF as a weathercock for investment is going to be more influential in the market and help stabilize the market by increasing the proportion of shareholding.
In addition, it will also help to guide investors on how to be a rational investor and how to make a value investment.
Karl Hartmann was admitted to the Leipzig Conservatory at the age of 18 and later studied under Webern.
When the Nazi came to power, Harmann first expressed his resistance by not publishing his work in Germany and later even stopped composing all together.
He composed the symphony "Miserae" in 1933 and dedicated it to "my friends who sleep for all eternity."
In 1935, this symphony was premiered in Prague, which was followed by harassment of Nazi officials.
After that, Hartmann decided not to have any of his work performed under Nazi rule.
Hartmann's Concerto funerbre is a composition for violin and string orchestra. At that time, its manuscript was smuggled out of Germany and first performed in Switzerland.

US Senate confirms Scalia as Labor Secretary - Xinhuanet
By Ding Sun, Xianlai Deng in Washington, Xinhua News Agency, September 26. The US Senate voted to approve President Trump’s nomination of Eugene Scalia as Labor Secretary.
There were 53 votes for and 44 against the nomination, and no single Democrat voted for Scalia.
Republicans thought that Scalia’s record suggested he is suitably qualified to head the Department of Labor.
From the perspective of Democrats, however, Scalia has long stood on the opposite side of workers and labor unions in his career as a lawyer.
Scalia will succeed Alexander Acosta.
On July this year, the former Labor Secretary Acosta announced his resignation under immense pressure of public opinion against his “lenient treatment” afforded to Jeffrey Epstein, the American billionaire who was charged with sex assault and sex trafficking of underage girls.
Scalia is a 56-year-old partner at a famous law firm in the US, and his father is the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.
The Department of Labor, which is responsible for labor-related matters, is a cabinet-level department of the U.S. federal government.
On the same day, the White House also made a statement that Trump had nominated Peter Gaynor‎, the acting administrator of Federal Emergency Management Agency, to officially head this organization.
According to the procedure, Gaynor’s nomination needs to be confirmed by the Senate.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency is an agency of the United States Department of Homeland Security. Its responsibility involves coordinating the resources of federal government to respond to the emergencies including natural disasters and terrorist attacks that have occurred in the US, as well as the follow-ups to these emergencies.
Giant formation of the Strategic Missile Troop appears in every military review after its debut in China's 35th National Day parade
“This year's National Day parade is the debut of People's Liberation Army (PLA) Rocket Force as a strategic force on Beijing's Chang'an Avenue.”
Wang Bo from Commanding Group of the PLA Rocket Force Formation said.
The Missile Troop in the parade fully carried on the spirit of being able to fight, dedicate and endure hardships. They were trained carefully, strictly and scientifically. They presented a positive image of strategic military forces and emphasized their exactitude.
Both generals and soldiers strictly followed the standard and the requirement in this military parade training. They were trained to act immediately and resolutely and strictly follow the order.
They also focused on carrying on the craftsmanship spirit by grasping every detail to practice the technique and improving perseverance and the style of work. They were trained to have great poses, fast actions and sonorous voices. The Missile Troop formation was full of power and grandeur because of their exactitude and technological innovation.
As a high-tech strategic military force, the PLA Rocket Force has a tradition and advantage of emphasizing scientific and technological development and innovation.
During the military parade training, based on previous experiences, they improved the training quality and efficiency, achieved the harmony between the people and the vehicles, ensured the timing of formation moving and followed the standards in actual combat by breaking the set way of thinking and the traditional method and using advanced methods such as the GPS, laser ranging, high-definition imaging and real-time speed measurement.
The PLA Rocket Force has the same standard and higher requirement in the parade ground and the launch site. Each process and every detail were supervised during the training in order to make the parade ground both a training ground and an examination ground for the Rocket Force to increase combat effectiveness.
Iran's implementation of the Iranian nuclear agreement was further suspended with confirmation that its development of more advanced centrifuges was under way.
ECNS Sept 27 The UN's International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said Monday that Iran has once again violated the nuclear agreement by using the advanced centrifuges to produce enriched uranium, CNA reported.
It is reported that Iran is gradually violating the limitations of the Iran nuclear agreement in response to U.S. President Donald Trump's withdrawal from the deal in May 2018 and the restoration and tightening of sanctions against Iran.
The move follows Iran's suspension in July of two other commitments to keep its stockpile of enriched uranium under 300kg and enrich uranium not higher than 3.67%.
Under the nuclear deal, Iran will only be allowed to set up about 5,000 first-generation IR-1 centrifuges at Natanz to accumulate enriched uranium, and it will only be allowed to use a few more advanced models for research but not to facilitate the uranium enrichment.
If Iran succeeds in developing more advanced centrifuges, they will be able to enrich uranium several times faster, potentially being used for nuclear bombs.
According to the International Atomic Energy Agency's report, "On September 25th, the IAEA confirmed that Iran had developed advanced centrifuges of model 2 and model 3... Enriched uranium is being accumulated or is ready to be accumulated," reports said.
The UN's International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) presented the report to member states on June 26, and a diplomatic official responded: "They are busy at the [Natanz enriched uranium] facility."

Italian Education Minister Lorenzo Fioramonti calls for sugar taxes to protect public health.
Italian Minister of Education Lorenzo Fioramonti, of the anti-establishment Five Star Movement, proposed a motion to the parliament to call for new taxes on high-sugar drinks, sugary foods and airlines tickets.
It is reported that the Italian government will levy taxes on food products, such as sugary drinks and foods, that pose a threat to public health, as well as an environmental tax on airline tickets at one euro for a domestic flight and 1.5 euros for an international flight, according to the proposal of Italian Education Minister Fioramonti.
Fioramonti said that the measures to impose the taxes are expected to bring three billion euros of revenue for the Italian government although they seem to be of little effect.
The tax revenue will be invested in education, health and environmental protection.
Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte believed that this should be a practical plan. An Italian senator, member of the European Parliament and Leader of the League Party Matteo Salvini commented ironically on twitter that everybody should hide their desserts, cookies, bread and candies because the new government is going to impose sugar taxes.
According to the report, the sugar tax is a special tax especially on sugary drinks and high-calorie foods.
Levying taxes on sugar will be beneficial to public health.

The first Robtaxi fleet, including 45 Red Flag EV vehicles jointly developed by Apollo and FAW Red Flag, has been put into operation on parts of the roads open for the test ride in Changsha.
From now on, Changsha citizens can go Apollo's official website to apply for their privileges of being seminal users to get the opportunity of taking a test ride.
One participant passenger said that he sat at the back of the vehicle and started the self-driving ride just with one click on the screen in front of the passenger seat.
In the testing vehicle, one safety supervisor is required to sit at the driver's seat to maximize the safety of passengers in order to meet the requirements of current policies and regulations on the passengers' safety guarantee.
During the ride the vehicle is able to intelligently change lanes according to traffic conditions and automatically avoid any close overtaking of nearby cars in a short distance by judging their movements.
Throughout the whole test ride, the screen at the passenger side brings in real-time information about pedestrians, cars, and even includes some traditional blind spots on the road.
Even if the vehicle is blocked, any traffic signal on the way ahead and the signal switches can be informed to you in advance, all the vehicle and traffic data can be found at a glance.
We have ever heard of the self-driving on TV earlier, and it was believed to be too far away from us , howerver, it's so amazing to find it has come into life today.
We look forward to seeing its introduction into the lives of common people in the near future.
In June 2019, Apollo had got 45 licenses for the manned-test ride from Changsha municipal government.
At present, Changsha's open roads for the self-driving test, running through Changsha AI techno mart, meixi lake, yang lake, king hill and high-tech zone, has reached a total length of 135 kilometers and 70 square kilometers of coverage area, which is China's most advanced self-driving demonstration zone with the longest distance, the largest coverage, the most complex traffic enviroment and the most sophisticated basic infrastructue of road-vehicle coordination.
It was expected that Changsha will open nearly 50 kilometers of test-ride roads for the Apollo Robotaxi fleet by the end of 2019, and open the full length of 135 kilometers by the first half of 2020.
Lang Ping is still dissatisfied when women’s volleyball team won the game, saying that it is harder to play with stronger team with so many mistakes.
In the afternoon of 27th Beijing Time, Chinese woman’s volleyball team participated in the 9th game of the 2019 women’s volleyball world cup. The opponent was the strong Dutch women’s volleyball team. Finally, Chinese women’s volleyball team defeated the Dutch team with a score of 3:1. It is the ninth straight in the women’s volleyball world cup.
However, the head coach of the women’s volleyball team, Lang Ping, expressed her dissatisfaction with the team’s performance in the third round of the game afterward.
“In the third game, the opponent strengthened the offensive attack. Some (the first pass of ball) are not done well resulting in the incapability to smash the ball. Out team made many mistakes.”
“With that many mistakes, it is hard to win a game with stronger teams.”
Lang Ping said when interviewed after the game.
“We told the team members to focus. If we did not do well in the first pass due to the opponent’s strong attack, we need to do well in the adjustment. In addition, we need to compete with the opponent in the defense.”
Lang Ping also commented on the performance of Zhang Changning, saying that she was too eager to make a smash when meeting with difficulties in attacks. Thus, her move will be distorted.
She hoped that she can be patient. “Other team members will support her in attacks.”
China's development brings an opportunity rather than a threat or a challenge to the world
(The 70 years of a new China) White paper: China's development is an opportunity for the world, not a threat or challenge.
The white paper pointed out that China's development is an opportunity for the world, not a threat and a challenge.
The white paper said that as China's overall national strength and international influence have increased rapidly, some people in the world are concerned that China will follow the pattern of "seeking hegemony after getting powerful," and some people have put forward the so-called "China threat theory."
There are cognitive misunderstandings, deep-rooted prejudices, psychological imbalances led by the rise and fall of powers, and deliberate distortions to protect existing interests.
To achieve national prosperity, national revitalization, and people's well being is not only the dream of the Chinese people but also the common dream of the people of all countries.
"China's development is an opportunity for the world, not a threat or challenge."
The white paper pointed out that China is the main stabilizer and source of power for global economic growth, the largest contributor to global economic growth. China's technological innovation will foster new drivers for global economic growth. In the future, the role of stabilizer and power source of China's economy will become even more prominent.
The current growth of the world's economy is underpowered, and a sound Chinese economy is increasingly important to the world.
China's economy is shifting from high-speed growth to high-quality development, the new-type industrialization, informatization, urbanization and agricultural modernization are in the fast lanes. With economic structures further adjusted and industrial optimizations continuously upgraded, China's new economic growth points continue to emerge.
"The McKinsey Global Institute's research report believes that by 2040, the integrations between China and the rest of the world economic entities are expected to create an economic value of $22 trillion to $37 trillion US dollars, equivalent to 15%-26% of the total global economy. Strengthening the cooperation between the rest of world economic entities and China will create huge economic value."
The white paper stressed that China's economy and the global economy have undergone structural changes and deep integrations
China, which has a more stable economic operation, higher growth quality and promising growth prospects, is a long-term favorable driver of the development of the world economy.
Taking China's economic development as a "threat" and "challenge", trying to push China out of the global industrial chain, supply chain and value chain, and "decoupling" China from the world economy is neither feasible nor favorable.
The white paper pointed out that a full-scale opening to the outside world will create more opportunities for other countries to share the "China Dividends."
China is unswervingly pursuing a mutually beneficial strategy of opening up to the outside world and will open up even more vigorously and at a higher level. China has the largest potential consumer market in the world, and it is the most attractive investment destination, and a larger scale of "going overseas" will benefit more countries.
"The opening should be bilateral and mutually beneficial, not one-way and one-sided.
Only the two-way and mutual benefit can go a long way."
The white paper said that China is committed to continuing to expand imports, relax restrictions on market access, improve the business environment, and strengthen intellectual property protections. Other countries should also open wider and take corresponding measures to improve their own business.
Only when all parties act in the same direction can an open, inclusive, universally beneficial, balanced and win-win development environment be created, and the "cake" of development will be made bigger and bigger to form a mutually beneficial community of interests.
The white paper pointed out that China provides more public products for the international community.
Which includes promoting high-quality joint construction of the "Belt and Road”, building a platform for multilateral dialogue and cooperation, actively participating in international and regional affairs, and actively provide foreign assistance.
"China's development was benefited from the international communities and it will never forget to give back to the international families and provide more and better public products for the international communities."
When being interviewed by the reporter of Xinhua Net, Andrey Slepnev, General Director of the Russian Export Center(REC) Group, said that Russia would like to enhance economic and trade cooperation with China, improve the export structure and promote Russia's diverse export to China.
Slepnev noted that the export of forestry, machine manufacturing and the chemical industry accounted for a high proportion of all Russia's export to China. Additionally, the export of agricultural products, including oil and fat products, meat products, dairy products, grains, fish and aquatic products, was also important.
In recent years, Russia's export of non-primary materials and non-energy products to China has consistently shown positive dynamics.
When talking about optimizing the structure of Russia's export to China, Slepnev said that Russia had already set a goal of expanding the export of high-tech products in order to meet the importing needs of China and other countries and regions around the world.
Russia's next step is to improve financial and non-financial measures to help increase the number of high-tech enterprises.
Slepnev said that Russia would like to export building technology and high-tech building materials to China and promote cooperation with China in industries such as aviation and the pharmaceutical industry.
There is also great potential for cooperation between Russia and China in developing urban environment.
Slepnev emphasized that many Russian products are "of competitive quality and prices" with products produced by western countries.
In terms of the 200-billion-dollar bilateral trade volume goal in 2024, Slephnev said that industries such as agriculture, machine manufacturing, the chemical industry and forestry will play an important role in achieving the goal.
Russia would like to provide diverse products in these industries in order to promote the export of highly processed products.
He emphasized that Russia would like its exporting companies to be part of the global value-added chain. China is one of the main exporting destinations.
Russia's manufacturers in the agricultural, metallurgic, oil and natural gas and chemical industry are all capable of being part of the process.
By far, the two countries need to enforce their cooperation by "establishing more Sino-Russian joint ventures and developing the export to the third country collaboratively."
Slepnev said that the REC was supporting Russia's export to China by adopting measures and providing relevant services through Russia Export Credit and Investment Insurance Office(EXIAR) and the Export-Import Bank of Russia.
Moreover, the REC would continue to deepen cooperation with relevant Chinese authorities to allow Russian products to be exported to China more easily and increase varieties of products exported to China.

In the regular press conference on the 27th, China's Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang responded to a Taiwanese officer's recent attendance at a meeting on religious issues at UN headquarters, saying such an underhand ploy will only become a laughingstock.

Demonstration in Egypt calling for President to step down The authorities will implement a harsh crackdown
The hashtags on Twitter and other social media advocate that Egyptian civilians go on the street, appealing for President al-Sisi to step down.
Yet the authorities express that they will implement a harsh crackdown.
Since al-Sisi seized power in a military coup as the director of military in 2013, expression of dissents has nearly disappeared. Any kind of protest was extremely dangerous for protesters.
As reported by The Guardian in the UK, the Center for Economic and Social Rights in Cairo, which is a nongovernmental organization, pointed out that more than 1900 people have been arrested since the protests against al-Sisi that rarely occurred broke out last weekend.
Al-Sisi and his family are accused of corruption as they squander public funds out of vanity, causing thousands of civilians go on the street for protest.
Yesterday the Ministry of Interior of Egypt firmly expressed that they would strike back any attempts to destabilize the country without mercy.
The center of Cairo has been guarded. The riot squad, cars of security institutions and plainclothes intelligence agents are everywhere on the streets around the Tahrir Square, which was a focal point for the Egyptian Revolution of 2011.
Al Jazeera reported that security forces had detained many scholars and social elites on 25th, including the professor in politics at Cairo University Nerva, who is also a famous columnist.
He twittered on 24th: “I won’t doubt that al-Sisi’s empery will result in disasters.”
“It is beneficial to Egypt if he is immediately dismissed.”
Before Nerva was arrested, Hosny, the prolocutor for the former Egyptian Military Chief of Staff Annam, had been detained.
Annam was arrested last year when he and al-Sisi tried to run for President.
Dawoud, the leader of the Constitution Party, was also detained.
The analysists and politicians think that the crackdown on people with dissent reflects the instability and weakness of the government, especially when the poor and middle class are in a deteriorating economic plight.
The leader of the opposition party Ayman Nour, who used to run for president, said: “The arrests reveal that this regime disregards Egyptian human rights and how scared it is.”
“AS the economics has been spoiled and the general political oppression it exerts, al-Sisi passed clear information to high-ranking military officers and politicians who might be able to succeed him.”
Nour noted that against the background of continuous deterioration of social economics, the government’s crackdown would make civilians angrier.
Since the fear has been overcame, he expects more people will go on the demonstration.
The small-scale demonstrations in different cities last week were stemmed from a call by Ali, a former military construction contractor living in exile in Spain as a merchant and actor. In a series of videos that he posted at the beginning of this month, he self-proclaimed that he benefited from government’s corruption.
Ali said his company Amlac would always gain lucrative contracts without statutory tender, stressing corruption the military and al-Sisi’s family including the First Lady Intissar Amer al-Sisi.
He bitterly regretted having taken part of it.
Ali claimed that he helped al-Sisi build palaces luxury hotels, in marked contrast to Egyptian people’s poor lives at present. In addition, al-Sisi did not pay for that.
Many hashtags on twitter, such as “you are not alone to stand out”, “al-Sisi is finished”, “al-Sisi out”, and “next Friday”, have attracted tens of thousands of tweets and re-tweets, appealing the public to go on the street and request al-Sisi to step down.
The Egyptian actor in Hollywood Amor Wake has nearly 7 million followers under his twitter.
He twittered using Arabic yesterday: “al-Sisi is bound to be finished…He is finished, and his supporters would make a terrible blunder now.”
Hong Kong government provides free special training to help employees weather a hard time
On the 27th, the Government of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) announced a plan to provide free special training for employees who have been in difficulties because of the current economic condition. Students who complete the course and gain a qualification can receive at most 4000 Hong Kong dollars of allowance every month.
There have been only a few customers in many boutiques in Harbour City in Tsim Sha Tsui, Kowloon.
Affected by the recent social disputes in Hong Kong, the number of visitors to Hong Kong has fallen dramatically. In addition to the tourism industry, many other industries including the hotel, catering and retail business have all been affected.
The Secretary for Labour and Welfare of the Hong Kong SAR government Law Chi-kwong and the Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development Edward Yau met the press to introduce measures to entrust the Employees Retraining Board (ERB) to implement a special training plan and support the development of the tourism industry.
Law Chi-kwong described that the Hong Kong economy is facing imminent challenges and the government should start to address them as soon as possible.
As a result, the Hong Kong SAR government launched the free training plan called "Special: Love Plus".
People who lost their jobs or were asked by the employers to stay at home unpaid after June 1st can join the plan as long as they meet the requirements.
Law Chi-kwong introduced that the course covers a wide range of knowledge. The most important part is the training of professional skills, which include skills of 19 industries, such as the tourism, retail and food industry. There are also new courses on creative technologies and general skills.
Chairman of the ERB Yu Pang-chun said that all the courses are free of charge and the plan is estimated to support 10 thousand people who are in need of help.
In order to gain the allowance, what a participant should do is to complete all full-time courses or some part-time courses and have an 80 percent of the attendance record. The upper limit of the amount of allowance is 4000 HK dollars.
The course usually lasts for two to three months and is provided by 50 training institutions. Citizens can sign up and begin their courses from October 3rd to March 31st 2020. Each person can sign up for less than four courses.
Additionally, the Hong Kong SAR government announced several measures to help the tourism industry to weather a crunch.
The measures include allocating more money to support the Travel Industry Council of Hong Kong, giving financial aid to 6000 guides to sign up for the course and exempting travel agencies from annual fees.
Is it true that doing exercise will exhaust people physically and psychologically?
According to sputniknews.com, a study focusing on athletes has found that the brain will also show signs of fatigue after doing high-intensity exercises.
The study, led by Mathias Pesiglion, an expert at the Hospital Pithier-Salpetriere in France, showed that there was no definite link between mental work and physical labor: both will require cognitive control over the activities.
"You need to control the autonomous processes that force you to stop when you have pain in your muscles and joints," Pesagrion explained.
The study was initiated by France's National Institute of Sport, Expertise and Performance (INSEP).
Experts at the school are responsible for guiding athletes in their preparations for the Olympic Games.
Some athletes have begun to suffer from overtraining syndrome, which is an uncontrollable feeling of fatigue after doing a heavy load of exercises that makes their bodies unable to recover and makes their performance decline.
INSEP raised a question: could nerve fatigue be part of the reasons that will cause such a disease, the kind of nerve fatigue that results from excessive mental labor?
The research was published in the journal of Contemporary Biology.

According to Cui Aimin, China had reached visa abolition agreement with 14 countries by the end of August this year, involving people with ordinary passports.
Furthermore, more and more countries unilaterally provide visa-free access landing visa for the convenience of Chinese citizens.
42 countries and regions including Thailand and Egypt unilaterally provide landing visa for Chinese citizens with ordinary passports, while 15 countries and regions including Indonesia provide Chinese citizens with ordinary passports with visa-free access.
In addition to visa-free service and landing visa, it is more and more convenient for Chinese citizens to apply for visas with increasingly simpler procedures.
China and 41 countries had reached agreement on the simplification of visa procedure with 41 countries by the end of August.
It reached agreement with the US, Canada, Israel and Argentina to mutually issue 10-year valid multi-entry visa for tourists and businessmen, and another agreement with UK to mutually issue the 2-year multi-entry visa for tourists, businessmen and visiting relatives.
UK and Belgium jointly provided the one-stop service of visa, while France, Italy and Singapore cur down the visa processing time to 48 hours, 36 hours and 24 hours, respectively.
For businessmen who go abroad frequently, the APEC business travel card for multi-entry and convenient custom clearance is a good choice.
According to Cui Aimin, holding this card means having the 5-year multi-entry visa to 16 economic entities around Asia-Pacific, which is of great importance to businessmen, especially the staff at private enterprises.
At present, the number of Chinese people holding the valid card ranks as the first place in the APEC economic entities.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs will actively negotiate the reciprocal agreement on bilateral visa and promote more countries to provide convenient visa procedures for Chinese citizens, putting more diplomatic working achievements into initiatives that are beneficial and convenient for civilians and constantly improving the “gold content” of China passport.

The United States will deploy additional air defense systems and troops in Saudi Arabia
The U.S. Department of Defense announced on the 26th that following an earlier attack on the oil facilities in Saudi Arabia, the United States will deploy an additional "Patriot" air defense system, four "Sentinel" radar systems and about 200 US troops in the country.
The Pentagon said in a statement that day, the deployment will boost the air defense and anti-missile capabilities of key military targets and civilian infrastructure in Saudi Arabia, as well as enhance the US military presence in the region.
The statement also said that US Secretary of Defense Esper approved at the same time to include two suits of "Patriot" air defense systems and one set of "THAAD" anti-missile system in the sequence ready for deployment.
Some US defense media have questioned the effectiveness of the deployment, saying that the primary interception target of the Patriot and THAAD systems is not the low-altitude targets such as drones and cruise missiles that the US claims have hit Saudi Arabia.
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said in the general debates at the United Nations General Assembly on the 25th that Iran can help maintain "Persian Gulf security" and ensure the smooth and safe passage of oil tank vessels cruising through the Strait of Hormuz, provided that all countries can enjoy equal rights.
He also stressed that regional security can only be achieved if U.S. troops withdraw from the region.
On the 14th of this month, several drones attacked two oil facilities belonging to the Saudi National Petroleum Corporation and gave rise to a fire.
The United States accused Iran of launching the attack and imposed new sanctions on Iran.
Thalys Chairman increased own holdings after encouraged employees to hold shares last year which led to a floating profit of 43%
In the evening of September 25, Chinese medical technology company Thalys (603716.SH) announced that Wei Wen, actual controller and Chairman of the company, completed the plan to increase shareholding by 1.0542 million shares, accounting for 0.5139% of the company's total capital share, through call auction in the Shanghai Stock Exchange. The total amount of the increase in shareholding was 20.0926 million Chinese yuan, including transaction fees such as stamp tax, commission and interest.
It was reported that before the implementation of the plan to increase the shareholding, Wei Wen directly held 8.58 million shares of Thalys, accounting for 4.18% of the company's total capital share. Tianjin Ruimei Scientific Instrument Co., Ltd. (hereafter Tianjin Ruimei), the company's shareholder, holds 82.1835 million shares of the company, accounting for 40.06% of the company's total capital share. Wei Wen holds 66.06% of Tianjin Ruimei's shares, making him the actual controller of the company.
It is worth noting that this is not the first time for Thalys to offer a favorable measure.
Since September last year, Thalys has successively launched measures such as shareholding increase among senior executives, chairman-guaranteed shareholding increase initiative, share repurchase and equity incentives in just a year.
On September 18 last year, Thalys announced that seven senior executives, including Wenhao Liu, had increased their shareholdings by 394,300 shares, accounting for 0.1922% of the company’s total capital share. The total amount of the increase in shareholding was 7.0229 million yuan. The shareholding increase had been completed.
Shortly after that, Wei Wen proposed a plan for employees to increase the holding of the company's shares and promised to compensate for any loss.
The planned period of increasing shareholding was from October 19 to October 31, 2018. The upper limit of the shareholding increase should not exceed 150 million. After the increase, the company's shares must be held continuously for more than 12 months without any reduction. Additionally, compensation will not be paid to employees who have resigned.
The reporter found that the lowest share price of Thalys was 14.02 yuan and the highest was 16.44 yuan during the employee shareholding increase plan period. Based on the closing price of Thalys on September 25, the highest floating profit of shareholding increase reached 42.08% and the lowest was 21.87%.
On January 21 this year, Thalys once again passed the share repurchase plan. The announcement stated that the total amount of capital for share repurchase was not less than 160 million yuan and not more than 280 million yuan.
On August 8 this year, the company issued an announcement of "Thalys 2019 Restricted Plan for Share Incentives (Draft)" and set high conditions for unlocking performance.
The announcement showed that equity incentives were based on the operating revenue in 2018. The growth rates for the four fiscal years from 2019 to 2022 must not be less than 30%, 70%, 120% and 185% respectively.
Thalys' performance in the first half of this year showed that the company had maintained high growth and exceeded the unlock conditions for performance growth by 30%.
In the first half of the year, the company achieved an operating revenue of 842 million yuan, which was up 46.5% year-on-year. The net profit for shareholders of listed company was 56.223 million yuan, which was a 16.46% increase over last year.
Since the report in the middle of 2018, the growth of the operating revenue of Thalys has been more than 38% over the previous year for five reporting periods, with the highest growth of 59%.
In 2018, the company formulated a dual-core driven collaborative development strategy which takes medical inspection intensive operation services (IVD business) as the basis, medical consumables intensive operation services (SPD business) and regional inspection centers as the breakthrough. That is to promote the SPD business on the basis of improving the IVD business.
A source from Thalys told the reporter that in order to follow the trend of medical reform and achieve rapid expansion, Thalys had been promoting its three major businesses steadily.
In terms of the SPD business, in January this year, Thalys announced the signing of a three-year agreement of Cooperation in the Construction of Intensive Operation Platforms for Medical Consumables and Daily Operation Management Services with Lingwu People's Hospital and Lingwu Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital.
"In fact, Thalys is vigorously expanding its SPD business to provide medical institutions with refined operational services such as centralized procurement, warehousing management, distribution, and settlement of medical consumables in hospitals to obtain long-term revenue."
The source said.
On September 17, according to the announcement of the Zhejiang Government Information Platform for Purchasing Services, Thalys won the bid for an "in-hospital logistics extension service project for medical consumables (including reagents)" at Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine.
An analyst in the pharmaceuticals industry pointed out that the bid they won was of high value. Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital was the first public hospital in the mainland of China that received Joint Commission International (JCI) accreditation. The successful implementation of this project in the future would be an important opportunity for the hospital's development.
According to the analyst, through the expansion in regions, nationwide strategic cooperation and channel mergers and acquisitions, Thalys has basically completed the business coverage of the provinces across the country.
By winning the bid of Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital, the company will continue to carry out the model in different hospitals to enhance its competitiveness in the East China market.
In addition, Thalys is also developing its business in new areas such as industrial hemp and blockchain technology.

1 AC and 1 DC two major UHV projects have been put into operation
On the 26th, the ±1100 KV UHV DC transmission project from Zhundong to southern Anhui and the Sutong 1000 KV AC UHV GIL integrated pipeline corridor project were both put into operation.
The power transmission technologies at work in both projects are at the very top of the world in their respective fields, which will sharply boost the optimization of China's large-scale energy allocation after the operation kicks off.
Guo Zhi, chief economist of the National Energy Administration, said that the project from Zhundong to southern Anhui is the world's largest power transmission project with the longest transmission distance.
Its operation is of great significance for promoting the development of Xinjiang's energy base and ensuring the power supply in eastern China.
GIL refers to gas insulated metal enclosed transmission line.
The Sutong pipeline corridor project has set a world record with the highest voltage level and the strongest transmission capacity among all GIL projects, realizing AC double-loop network's closed-loop operation of the highest voltage level in the backbone grid of eastern China.
According to the State Grid Corporation of China, the transmission distance from Zhundong to southern Anhui is up to 3,324 kilometers.
If conventional technologies were applied, more than 15 percent of the electricity will be lost in its transmission. Through the project's research and development, the economic transmission distance has been greatly increased to more than 3,000 kilometers.
After the project from Zhundong to South Anhui is put into operation, it can deliver 100 million kWhs of electricity every 8 hours and 20 minutes, which will help solve the problem of Xinjiang's existing new energy consumption.
According to the estimates of its full-load capacity, the annual transmission of this line alone will reach 60 to 85 billion kWhs, which can satisfy more than half of Shanghai's electricity consumption throughout the year.
The Sutong GIL integrated pipeline corridor project is the controlling part of UHV AC ring network crossing the Changjiang River.
If conventional overhead lines were applied to cross the river, two giant steel towers more than 450 meters tall could have to be built up in the Changjiang River, and a man-made island covering an area of more than four football fields would have to be built for each tower.
With nerve and creativity, the State Grid has developed its compact UHV AC GIL transmission technology to avoid the impact on the golden waterways by crossing the river via underwater tunnels.
The two projects have made a new leap in China's manufacturing capabilities of electrical equipment.
At present, the State Grid has completed 10 AC and 11 DC UHV projects in total, and there are still 4 AC and 3 DC projects under construction.
SAFE: China's external debt structure has continued to be optimized and its stability strengthened.
"Overall, China's external debt structure has continued to be optimized and its stability strengthened."
Wang Chunying, spokesperson and Chief Economist of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange(SAFE), said on the 27th that major indicators of the country's external debt are within the internationally recognized safety line and the risk of the external debt is generally controllable.
Wang Chunying made the above statement when answering questions from reporters after SAFE published China's external debt data at the end of June 2019 on the same day.
By the end of June this year, China's full-scale outstanding external debt (in both domestic and foreign currencies)stood at 1.998 trillion U.S. dollars, up 1.3 percent or 26.3 billion dollars from the end of March, mainly due to the increase in the balance of debt securities, SAFE data showed.
In the second quarter of 2019, more than 70 percent of the increase in China's full-scale external debt was driven by the purchase of domestic yuan-denominated bonds by non-residents. These non-residents were mainly medium- and long-term investors in banks such as the People's Bank of China.
At the end of June 2019, the ratio of the medium- and long-term external debt rose by 3 percentage points and the ratio of external debt in domestic currency rose by 1 percentage point from the end of March 2019.
International investors have shown further recognition of China's bond market and have increased their holding of domestic yuan-denominated bonds after the country's yuan-denominated bonds were added to the Bloomberg Barclays Global Aggregate Index in April this year, according to Wang Chunying.
"China maintains an overall balance of international payments and the risk of the external debt is generally controllable."
Reporters learned from Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences on the 27th that the fall armyworm have been effectively brought under control without causing large-scale outbreaks and disasters, marking the achievement of prevention work at this stage.
The fall armyworm migrated from outside China was first discovered this January in Jiangcheng County, Pu'er City, Yunnan Province. Later, another 129 counties of Yunnan confirmed its presence, and the pest also spread from Yunnan towards inland, posing a direct threat to China's agricultural production.
The fall armyworm is an important polyphagous agricultural pest with long-distance migration capability that is originated from tropical and subtropical regions in North and South America. It is a dangerous migratory pest with "transboundary, migratory, outbreaking, and destructive" capabilities for which the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization has launched a global warning system.
This pest attacks more than 80 crops including corn, sugar cane, and sorghum, with its big consumption that could lead to the loss of up to 70% of the yield.
It is difficult to prevent and control, as there is currently no registered pesticide against it in China.
Since the fall armyworm invaded Yunnan, Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences appointed the researcher Chen Aidong, who led a team of green prevention and control of transboundary pest from Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences, went to the front line to conduct field work, collect samples, and give technical instructions and experimental demonstrations.
Chen Aidong’s team has established a preliminary understanding of situation, including the pest’s population characteristics, predators, characteristics of foreign pest origins, migration trajectories, pesticide toxicity, effects of field control, etc.
They actively carried out research on green pest prevention technology and its applications, including population monitoring, adult trapping, scientific use of pesticides, and agronomic methods, etc. Through these methods, they managed to control more than 90% of the pest in the demonstration area while reducing the use of chemical pesticides, which protects the predators and the ecological environment and provides Yunnan with technical support for effective control of the outbreak of the fall armyworm and for its sustainable management.
As of now, the fall armyworm in Yunnan has been effectively brought under control without causing large-scale outbreaks and disasters, marking the achievement of prevention work at the current stage.
As for the next step, Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences will focus on the ecological mechanism that triggered the outbreak of the pest's invasion, and aim to make a breakthrough in biological control and establish a system of green prevention and control.
Meanwhile, they will actively seek more international collaborations and aim to establish joint key laboratories, monitoring sites, and demonstration areas in order to enhance Yunnan's capability of comprehensive monitoring and early warning of the fall armyworm.

Through its interactions with the world, China has brought positive energy to world peace and development. China's path is in line with its national conditions and meets the requirements of the times, the White Paper said.
China has gone into practical actions to safeguard world peace.
Over the past 70 years, China has never instigated any war or conflict on its own initiative, nor has it encroached on an inch of land from any other country.
The White Paper points out that the fundamental reason for China's great success in its development over the past 70 years is that it has found the right path of developing socialism with Chinese characteristics and will unswervingly go down this road.
This is a path based on China's national condition by putting the interests of the people at the top place, keeping reform and innovation, and pursuing common development through opening up and comprehensively governing the country in accordance with the law.
China is a large country with complex national conditions, and its difficulty of governance is rarely seen anywhere else in the world. Without a centralized, unified and strong leadership, China will be separated and disintegrated, posing disasters to the world.
"Over the past 70 years, China has overcome all kinds of risks and challenges and created many world-renowned Chinese miracles one after another." the White Paper said.
Especially since the 18th National Congress of Communist Party of China, China has made historic achievements in its development and undergone historic changes, and a great leap forward has also come to the Chinese people as seen in their changes of historical roles from standing-up, getting rich and powerful. The Chinese nation is getting closer to the great objective of national revitalization than ever.
China's development path will, as time goes by, burgeon forth with more promising development prospects.

Scholars from China's Taiwan province suggest: Taiwanese businessmen should follow the Chinese mainland to develop mainstream industries during the "time of uncertainty"
The 2019 Taiwan Businessmen Innovation Business Model Forum was held in Taipei from the 26th to the 27th.
The forum invited many Taiwanese business representatives and scholars to share their experiences on enterprise transformation, innovation, succession and market expanding.
The forum was hosted by the Management Institute in Taipei and co-organized by organizations and institutions such as Capital Securities and the Association of Outstanding Taiwan Business in Chinese Mainland.
The two-day meeting was divided into several seminars including the transformation and upgrade of the model and business strategies. Over a hundred people attended the meeting.
Micky M. C. Chen, president of the Management Institute in Taipei said that as trade frictions between the US and (the mainland of) China continue, Taiwanese businessmen are now facing a "time of uncertainty".
He believes that Taiwanese businessmen should keep pace with the time and keep up with the mainstream industries developed in the Chinese mainland and should pay special attention to innovative products in the technology, culture, tourism and health industry.
"Taiwanese businessmen focused on quality, efficiency and payment in the past."
Micky believes that currently, focusing on the above conditions is no longer enough for Taiwanese businessmen.
He pointed out that Taiwan-funded enterprises should have both speeds and services. They should speed up the supply chain and pay attention to extension services and life products services.
In addition, the value-added service is also a new field that Taiwan businessmen can greatly develop.
In the speech session for representatives, a Taiwanese businessman who is the chairman of Action Asia (Shenzhen) Co., Ltd. from China's southern Guangdong province said that the company once experienced operational difficulties due to a sudden reduction in the number of orders. The group then started to improve its operating conditions from structural adjustment and asset activation.
It took the company three years to become profitable after abandoning the traditional electrical appliances business, transforming automotive electronic equipment and entering the smart home appliance industry.
General manager of Apollo Electronics (Zhuhai, China) (headquarter of Apollo Group) Pai Anthony Hung Chang proposed that when encountering difficulties in developing new customers, a company should try to focus more on providing "one-stop" services for the existing customers.
There are usually six reasons when customers change their suppliers: poor services, high prices, low quality, slow delivery speed, less variety and honesty issues. As long as these six points are solved, combining with timely modification of production lines and expansion of product categories, companies will become irreplaceable for customers.
On the 27th, the awarding ceremony of the "2019 Outstanding Taiwanese Businessmen in the Mainland of China" was also hosted by the Management Institute in Taipei.
According to Economic Daily in Taiwan, General Manager of Golden Field which has the operation center in the Shanghai Stephen Lu won the “Outstanding Taiwanese Businessmen and Cross-Strait Contribution Award”.
New regulation is in seek of advice -- social capital needs qualification to acquire rural land management rights
Social capital needs qualification to acquire rural land management rights
Administrative Measures on the Circulation of Rural Land Management Rights, which aims to supervise the acquisitions of land management rights by social capital from industrial and commercial enterprises, starts to solicit public opinions
A notice for public consultation on the Administrative Measures on the Circulation of Rural Land Management Rights (A Revised Version for Public Consultation) (hereinafter referred to as the Consultation Draft), which enhances the supervision and risk control on acquiring land management rights through the circulation of social capital from industrial and commercial enterprises, was published on the website of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs (MOA) yesterday.
The Consultation Draft is now open for public opinion today.
According to (MOA), in order to carry out the newly-revised Rural Land Contracting Act, to further consolidate and improve the basic rural management system, deepen the reform of rural land regulatory system, and implement the system for “separating the ownership rights, contract rights, and management rights for contracted rural land", the Administrative Measures on the Circulation of Management Rights was revised by MOA to form the Consultation Draft.
The Beijing Youth Daily reporter learned that there were a number of important amendments to the Consultation Draft which was published for the first time.
The newly-revised Rural Land Contracting Act clarifies the range of land circulation, implements the concept of "three rights", and elaborates on both "land contracting management rights" and "land management rights" respectively in a separate section to help make a clear distinction between land management rights transfer, exchange and circulation (renting, subcontracting, shareholding or other ways).
As shown in the Consultation Draft, in order to implement the concept of "three rights" and echo effectively with the keynote of the Rural Land Contracting Act, as well as to take into consideration the big differences between the circulation of land management rights and the exchange of land contracting management rights in terms of the parties concerned, procedures and supervisions, the revised version defines the scope of land circulation, focuses on the circulation of land management rights including renting, subcontracting, etc., and also changes the regulation's name from the Administrative Measures on the Circulation of Rural Land Contracting Management Rights to the Administrative Measures on the Circulation of Rural Land Management Rights.
As for the transfer and exchange of land contracting management rights, administrative measures for supervision will be introduced separately.
The Consultation Draft pointed out that in the context of "three rights", what farmers bring in business is land management rights for only a certain period of time.
In theory, even if there is a bankruptcy liquidation, farmers will only be exposed to the risk of losing their management rights for a certain period of time. As a result, there is no legal necessity to stipulate that the contracted land should be returned to the original contractor, which is also in conflict with the Bankruptcy Act.
In order to put in control the risk of farmers' losing of their land, preferred stock, rent-to-share, buyback and other solutions were introduced in practice.
As preferred stock has been largely discussed in the Company Act, it is suggested being taken as an advocacy regulation to prevent the risk of losing the land.
