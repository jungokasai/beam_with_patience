Talent is the key to rural revitalization.
Where is talent found?
Outstanding returning rural migrant workers are an indispensable force in the fight.

Xinhua News Agency, reported July 26th Headline: Outstanding returning rural migrant workers can be a force for rural revitalization - Xinhuanet
Zhang Xiong, age 34, is a resident of Guoyuan Village in Meishan City, Sichuan Province who quit his job with a salary over 10,000 yuan in Beijing and returned to his hometown to start a business in 2010.
After a few years of effort, his family’s vinery now earns an annual income of over a million yuan, he has gained a small amount of fame for being a wealth creator, and he has also been selected as a member of the village’s “Two Committees”.
In recent years, national policies to alleviate poverty, revitalize rural areas, and benefit farmers and agriculture have inspired an increasing number of people outstanding migrant workers like Zhang Xiong to return to their hometowns to start their own businesses, which has become a new source of growth for rural areas.
Sichuan is a western Chinese province with a large population and that produces high labor outflows, but thanks to the province’s “Outstanding Rural Migrant Worker Return Incentives and Cultivation Project”, in 2019 alone, the program has produced more than 8,000 village party branch secretaries from returned outstanding rural migrant workers, brought back and cultivated a labor force of 61,000 for villages, and produced over 20,000 new Party members, creating a powerful guarantee in the fight to eliminate poverty and implement rural revitalization strategies.
Hometowns are the key to moderate prosperity.
Since reform and opening up, huge numbers of young in China have left rural villages to seek work elsewhere, and some, through their own hard work, have managed to start their own companies.
But objectively speaking, to varying degrees, it has also led to the “hollowing out” of Chinese villages, especially those where grassroots organizations are weak, and led to the “aging and lowering” phenomenon among village Party branch secretaries and cadres, in which these groups are both getting older and have lower educational attainment, leading to disinterest among young people in continuing the work of village Party organizations with weak leadership.
If rural talent and other assets only flow in one direction, to the cities, in the long term this leads to “loss of blood” and “anemia” in rural areas, in turn making “revitalization” an empty slogan.
Attracting back migrant workers who are capable, conscientious, and determined to serve their hometowns, incentivizing them to return there to start businesses and become wealth creators, and then cultivating them as Party members and rural cadres to enrich the ranks of grassroots cadres is a permanent solution to the problem of young people not continuing the work of rural Party corps and grassroots Party organizations.
Once outstanding rural migrant workers return, they also must be convinced to stay and do good work.
In recent years, Sichuan has focused more on Party-building among rural migrant workers, and on the basis of strict selection requirements, has established systems and mechanisms such as directed incentives for outstanding rural migrant workers to return, service guarantees, training and promotion, and selection and use which ensure they will gain from their effort, receive guarantees in their work, have things to look forward to in life, truly put down roots in the village, and feel a sense of accomplishment in their work and entrepreneurship.
This is the final year of the battle to decisively end poverty, and talent is the key factor to establish the connection between poverty alleviation and rural revitalization.
Party committees and governments at every level should prioritize rural migrant workers who return to their hometowns, and should use comprehensive measures to form them into a work corps and army that is willing to stay, capable of contributing, and unwilling to leave, so that they can serve as a powerful organizational guarantee and talent pool that supports rural poverty elimination and prosperity building efforts, as well as rural development and revitalization.
Thanks to the pandemic, this year’s university graduates are a very special class: On the evening of July 11th, the “Bilibili Summer Graduation Songs” offered up a special online show for new graduates with performances from musicians such as Lao Lang, Pu Shu, Li Yuchun, and Mao Buyi to give graduates a sendoff of music and good wishes.
The famous host of Up, Seal Wu, performed his song “Wild Grass”, a rap song based on Lu Xun’s poem of the same name, which is very popular with young people.
Because of the pandemic, many graduates will not be able to enjoy the sounds and sights of receiving their diploma in person, so they moved the ritual and all of its sensations online.
Statistics show that peak viewership of the 2.5 hour special event exceeded 35 million.
“Follow your heart, seize opportunities, don’t worry about the consequences, and you’ll reap rewards you never expected. “
Although it was a song for graduates, it moved many non-graduates as well.
“After watching the whole presentation, I wanted to cry for the beauty and regrets of youth, because no matter what, they are worth remembering, yet we all have to find the courage to carry on. “
Natural Ecology in Beijing Continues to Improve, attracting More than 500 Kinds of Wildlife to "Settle" in the City - Ecns.cn

Natural ecology in Beijing continues to improve, attracting wildlife to "settle" in the city
Beijing now has more than 500 species of wild animals.
(Reporter Wang Bin) The Beijing Youth Daily reporter learned from the Beijing Gardening and Greening Bureau that in recent years, as the natural ecology of the capital continues to improve, the species and number of wild animals had also continued to increase.
At present, the number of terrestrial vertebrate wildlife inhabiting Beijing exceeds 500, including national first-level protected animals such as the brown-eared pheasant and black stork, as well as national second-class protected animals such as the goral, whooper swan, grey crane and mandarin duck.
Whether urban forests planted within the Second Ring Road or a small wetland embedded between buildings, it not only brings nature's rustic charm to the citizens of the capital, but also attracts wild animals to "settle" in the city.
In the summer, the Songshan Nature Reserve in the Yanshan Mountains in the north-west of Yanqing District is full of life.
A raccoon dog is playing by a creek, while two badgers are playing with each other nearby.
When looking back, you can see that a wild boar, unable to resist the "itch" on its body, is rubbing against a tree. Hu Qiaoli, Director of the Songshan Nature Reserve Management Office, said that by the end of 2019, 178 species of wildlife, including the golden eagle, a national first-level protected animal, as well as the koklass pheasant and gazelles, national second-level protected animals, have been living in this green zone with a total area of more than 6,200 hectares, and nearly a third of wildlife species in Beijing could be found here.
"Here in Songshan, wild animals are the real 'owners' and our staff can at best be thought of as their 'bodyguards'. ”
Hu Qiaoli said, in order to understand the situation of wildlife in the reserve, more than 30 professional patrol members patrol along 16 specifically developed protection routes every day, and every month there is a major one-day round trip for them to walk through almost the entire reserve.
"During the patrols, they not only check and record the biodiversity, but also the conditions of artificial bird nests, in addition to rescuing injured wildlife, installing infrared cameras in the field, and so on. ”
Now, the Songshan Nature Reserve has more than 200 infrared cameras to record the living conditions of wildlife in the forest.
Hu Qiaoli said that as the reserve's biodiversity has improved over the past few years, more and more wild animals have appeared on camera, with leopard cats, raccoons dogs, and hog-nosed badgers becoming "regular guests"; meanwhile, the goral, a national second-level protected animal, has been captured even more frequently.
Zhang Zhiming, Director of the Wildlife and Wetland Protection Department of the Beijing Gardening and Greening Bureau, said that the number of terrestrial vertebrate wildlife in Beijing has increased from 461 species in 1994 to more than 500 species today, and that the number of wildlife species in Beijing has continued to increase in recent years.
The increasingly common presence of wildlife in the city is closely related to the continuous upgrading of urban greening in Beijing in recent years.
In particular, the new round of One Million Mu of forestation and greening construction, which began in 2018, intends to reshape the urban ecological environment, enhance the ecological functions of woodlands and greenbelts, and highlight the concept of being "close-to-nature".
The plan aims to achieve interconnection and interaction with the surrounding greenbelts, so that wild animals can easily "visit their relatives and friends", and the trees planted are nectar and food source plants that these animals love.
Agricultural Modernization in the Black Land -- Xinhua Net
Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, July 26th, 2020 Title: Agricultural Modernization in the Black Land
In mid-summer, two planes that spray pesticides flew above the Ten Thousand Mu High-Yield Demonstration Field of the Second Work Station, Fifth Management Area, Youyi Farm, forming two white lines, and the large characters “The World’s No.1 Farm” were extremely clear as formed by the black rice seedlings in the green field.
Kong Lingqiang, Director of the Work Station, said that such planes were able to spray pesticides over 6,000 mu (400 hectares) of fields per day, the efficiency of which was eight times unmanned aerial vehicle, and hundreds of times that of human labor.
The farm is located in Youyi County, Heilongjiang Province, which is the largest grain production base of China, and judging from the swish of cutting the rice seedlings with sickles in the past to the rumble of motors today, we can see that China’s traditional agriculture and farm have changed tremendously in the black land.
Apart from planes, satellites are also used in the modernized agricultural production of Youyi Farm.
Kong Lingqiang stated that on one hand, they utilized satellite remote sensing technology to achieve accurate fertilization and reduce inputs in agriculture and pollution; on the other , satellite navigation technology improves the standardized work of agricultural machines in the field.
During the production of rice this year, the farm extended the area utilizing satellite navigation unmanned driving transplantation technology to 30,000 mu (2,000 hectares) from 3,000 mu (200 hectares) last year.
Such technology enables more even transplantation of rice seedlings, which maximizes the use of sunlight and arable fields, saving RMB 16 on human labor per mu on average.
The attempt to use new information technologies and intelligent technologies in the farm’s agricultural production is the largest agricultural machine group in China.
According to statistics, there are 49,000 agricultural machines held by the farms at present, and the overall mechanization rate is 99.8%.
The rates of using GPS satellite navigation for agricultural machines, accurate sowing in dry land, and using machines with high horsepower on dry land are all 100%.
“Green agriculture, smart agriculture, and digital agriculture are the directions of exploration in agricultural modernization, ”
Liu Hualian, President of Youyi Farm, said.
The key to agricultural modernization is scientific and technological advancements.
The Heilongjiang Agricultural Reclamation Bureau, on behalf of the farms it represents, has fully acted as the “aircraft carrier” of modernized agriculture in recent years, and has firstly built a modern agricultural system characterized by scaled planting, standardized production, and industrialized operation.
In the suburb of Youyi County, there is an agricultural machine exhibition park covering an area of 350,000 square meters.
It exhibits more than 140 agricultural machines and tools introduced and used by the Heilongjiang Agricultural Reclamation Bureau over the past years.
Those agricultural machines, tools, and farms bear witness the modernization process of Chinese agriculture.

At 4 p.m. on July 25th, Fu Kunbao wore a pair of rubber boots which were covered with mud as he walked from the front room to the back, scurrying to pack items with his wife Zhou Yan.
“When we got the call asking us to relocated from our village cadres, I was cutting the grass in the field. ”
Fu Kunbao said that he rented over 60 mu field to plant rice, the growth of which was healthy, “I just sprayed the pesticide yesterday, the tools were even not packed. ”
Fu Kunbao pointed to the pesticide sprayer in the corner, “No one wants his home to be lost in a flood, but we have to sacrifice our own interests for the public good. ”
To cope with the continuous high water levels at Chaohu Lake and the possible strong downpour, Hefei City is preparing to use a joint embankment at Jiangkou River, where Fu Kunbao’s home is located, to diverge the flood and save water.
The joint embankment of Jiangkou River is located in Feixi County, which is close to the bank of Chaohu Lake.
Thousands of villagers in Yandian Village and Sanhe Town will be relocated.
By 16:00 on July 25th, the water level of Chaohu Lake, the fifth largest freshwater lake in China, was still 13.2 meters, 0.7 meter higher than the safety level.
The kitchen of Fu Kunbao’s home was neat, with a bowl of pumpkin dishes on the table, and some eggs and vegetables in sauce in the fridge.
“I never thought I’d have to move away, and the current water level of Jiangkou River looks safe. ”
Zhou Yan said that her house is a bungalow, and she hasn’t found a suitable place to store the large items for now.
“I can pack expensive and important items first, and the large items like the fridge and television can be placed at a neighbor’s or relative’s house which is at a higher elevation. ”
Wang Liwen, village cadre, helped Fu Kunbao make plans.
Wang Liwen was in charge of the relocation of 13 households, so he informed the villagers one by one, and confirmed the settlement plan with everyone.
The nearest resettlement place to Fu Kunbao’s home is Suxiao Primary School in Yandian Village, which was two kilometers away.
Apart from the large items, the over 1,000 jin (500 kg) of grain and newly bought furniture was also a headache Fu Kunbao and his wife.
“We are going to move the grain to our relative’s home, but we have no way to move the furniture. ”
After discussion, the couple placed several chairs beneath their new bed, raising it by about 0.5 meters.
At 6 p.m., Fu Kunbao began to move these items to his relative’s home by tricycle, while Zhou Yan continued to pack at home.
At 11 p.m., the couple checked everything across the home, shut down the electricity, and left for the settlement place.
“We hope that the flooding ends soon, ”
Fu Kunbao said.
At 9:30 a.m. on July 26th, this journalist saw at Jiangkou River that the local government was fully prepared to divert the flood.
Zhang Jike and Lin Xiaozhai Form a Team to Support Youth with Great Muscles - Xinhua Net
The inspiring competitive show for youth sports, We Are The One, was officially broadcast on Hunan TV on July 11.
The team leader Zhang Jike and Sports Assistant Lin Xiaozhai are from different fields, but worked together, and commenters Lin Dan and Fu Yuanhui were each unique in their own way, but the appearance of the hardcore “enormous” strength gin pole made the program more “exciting”.
During the first episode, 11 young athletes came to the strength arena, and their appearance stunned the audience while arousing significant attention to their “fierce conflict” “robust confrontation”, and “strong hearts”.
Among them, the “fierce conflict” was from the awe-inspiring student athlete Qiao Wenyi, who publicly provoked “handsome boy” Xu Zhibin on the same racetrack with him when he joked that Xu Zhibin should be on a singing and dancing show, insulting his competitor’s appearance, and even saying that “if you lose, don’t cry or your make-up will run”.
His words made all the young people and sports officials gasp.
The “robust confrontation” was more like a battle between masters, with “Big Devil” Sun Jianqi competing against the formidable Zhang Xindong in a stunning match.
Their identity was also surprising, with Sun Jianqi an actor who is passionate about fitness, while Zhang Xindong is a retired commando who has won military medals three times.
At the start of the match, the two pulled on the small gin pole with all their strength, and the audience was anxious to see their more intense confrontation at the large gin pole.
The atmosphere was tense as one of the hosts of the program, Zhang Jike, also watched the battle intently.
When giving commentary, he was very careful, patiently encouraging the loser and helping him review his mistakes.
But sports assistant Lin Xiaozhai was a marvelous helper, who never concealed her appreciation for these good-looking and competitive young athletes.
After learning about their over-loaded daily training, she admired them a lot.
The other team leaders, Lin Dan and Fu Yuanhui, were each unique in their own way, with one being a calm “predictor”, while the other was the “bubbly optimistic girl” who eased the tension with her warm smile.
As sports assistants, Jike and Liu Ye also discussed several funny topics around young athletes.
Fire in Cathédrale Saint-Pierre-et-Saint-Paul de Nantes, France: Parochial Volunteer Who was Kind and Taciturn Confessed to Arson-Ecns.cn
July 26 (Ecns.cn) According to reports from foreign media, on July 18, the Cathédrale Saint-Pierre-et-Saint-Paul de Nantes, a religious, historical, and architectural treasure, was seriously damaged in a fire, and the great organ was completely destroyed.
On the 26th (CET), Nantes prosecutors announced that a parochial volunteer who was responsible for the security of the cathedral had been charged with "arson and destruction."
The suspect has already pleaded guilty.
According to the report, the local prosecutor Cenas said that the 39-year-old parochial volunteer from Rwanda admitted that he had set fire to three places in the cathedral at night.
His lawyer said that the arsonist now regrets doing such a thing.
He entered France via an asylum claim a few years ago, was sheltered in the parish where the fire happened, and was taken in by the church.
Prosecutors noted that recently, the suspect tried to update his visa and was in the process of dialogue with the police.
But workers in the cathedral couldn’t believe that the believer, who was kind and taciturn, would destroy the church he loved so much.
On the day of the fire on July 18, the volunteer was questioned by police about inconsistencies in his narrative, but he was later released.
Image shows rescue by firefighters at the scene.
On the evening of the 25th, the man was again subpoenaed as a result of new evidence obtained by professional engineers of the laboratory of the Paris Central Police Station.
This time, the man admitted to his arson.
If convicted of the crime of deliberate arson and destruction, the suspect will face 10 years' imprisonment and a fine of 150,000 euros.
It was reported that the fire caused serious damage to the Cathédrale Saint-Pierre-et-Saint-Paul de Nantes: the pipe organ in the church was completely burned and the stained glass window behind the pipe organ was also seriously damaged.
Brunel, the chief architect of French Built Heritage Conservation, believes that a conservative estimate of the required cathedral restoration work would take at least three years.
Comprehensive News: The Unilateralism of the United States Destroys Sino-US Relations, International Opinion Supports China’s Countermeasures -- Xinhua Net
BEIJING, July 26, 2020 (Xinhua, by foreign correspondents) On the morning of July 24, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People’s Republic of China announced to the US Embassy in China its decision to withdraw its consent for the establishment and operation of the US Consulate General in Chengdu, and the Ministry also made specific requirements for the cessation of all operations and events by the Consulate General.
International opinion holds the view that the unilateralism adopted by the US severely disturbs normal Sino-US relations, and China’s response to the irrational aggression of the US and its countermeasures against the US are proper and essential.
Andres Borquez, Directer of the China Research Center, Institute of International Studies at the University of Chile said that the unilateralism of the US destroyed the bridge between the people of the two countries, leading to the current crisis in Sino-US relations.
Therefore, China’s announcement of its closure of the General Consulate of the United States in Chengdu is a countermeasure against such unilateralism which conforms to the rules of foreign affairs.
Patricio Giusto, Professor of the Pontifical Catholic University of Argentina and Director of China-Argentina Research Center held the view that,\ China’s decisions were proper and essential countermeasures against the aggression of the US, which was not targeted at its general public.
The US tried to conceal their bad countermeasures against COVID-19 by exerting pressure on China to shift its public attention.
Bambang Suryono, Chairman of the Asian Creative Research Center, a think-tank in Indonesia, said that the aggressive attitude of the US severely disturbs normal Sino-US relations and brings about severe challenges.
Thus, China’s announcement of its closure of the General Consulate of the United States in Chengdu is a normal countermeasure which conforms to the rules of foreign affairs and shows China’s principle and stance to firmly defend their self-interests whilst embodying its rationality and principled position, and China’s etiquette of China’s coping with foreign affairs.
Francis Semwenza, a current affairs commentator of Tanzania, said that, China’s decisions were proper and essential responses to the aggression of the US.
For the re-normalization of Sino-US relations, the US government should actively improve its relationship with China, and quit its intervention in China’s domestic affairs.
The US government should focus more on win-win situations in both economic growth and politics, as well as benefiting people of both the two countries and even the whole global community.
Ali Yousif, Executive Director of the Sudan-based Association of Arab-Chinese Friendship, said that, the countermeasures forced to be taken were proper and essential responses to the irrational behavior of the US, which conformed to the basic rules of the international law and international relations, as well as the rules of foreign affairs.
The requirement to close the General Consulate of China in Houston seriously disobeyed the basic rules of the international law and international relations.
And he hoped the US would cancel the relevant decisions and create necessary conditions for the re-normalization of Sino-US relations.
An editorial in Singapore’s Lianhe Zaobao said that the broader strategic blueprint of the US was to contain China, and prohibit its continuous rise.
In face of the increasingly tight aggression, China was unwilling to witness the continuous deterioration of Sino-US relations, but it had no other choice but to take countermeasures.

July 26 (China News) According to reports in foreign media, hurricane “Hanna” landed in Texas at 5:00 p.m. local time on July 25th, bringing strong breeze and rainstorms, surges, and life-threatening flash floods to Texas.
According to the National Hurricane Center, Hanna is expected to carry rainstorms across parts of southern and northeastern Texas, causing surges and life-threatening flash floods.
It was reported that the area from the south of Corpus Christi to the estuary of the Rio Grande River was the area most seriously affected by Hanna, while large flash floods may break out in the Rio Grande Valley.
Abbott, governor of Texas, said on July 25th: "Any hurricane is a huge challenge. "

Poland to Withdraw from the European Treaty on Violence against Women
Poland will take steps next week to withdraw from the European Treaty on the Prevention of Violence against Women, the country's Justice Ministry said Saturday.
Poland's right-wing government cabinet said the treaty violated the rights of parents by requiring schools to teach students about gender issues.
Justice Minister Ziobro said at a press conference that his ministry will submit a request on Monday to the Ministry of Labor and the Family to begin withdrawing from the treaty.
That treaty is also called the Istanbul Convention.
Ziobro said,”The treaty contains elements which we consider to be of a harmful and ideological nature ”
Law and Justice, the ruling party of Poland, and its coalition partners have a close alliance with the Roman Catholic Church and advocate a conservative social agenda.
Polish president Duda made hostility to gay rights one of the main issues during his successful re-election campaign this month.
On Friday, thousands of Polish people (mostly women) protested against withdrawing from the convention in Warsaw and other cities.
"The purpose of withdrawing from the treaty is to legalize domestic violence," Lempart, one of the organizers of the protest, said during a protest march in Warsaw.
Some protesters carried banners that said "Law and Justice is women's hell."
Law and Justice has long complained about the Istanbul Convention.
Poland's previous centrist government ratified the convention in 2015.
Law and Justice says the treaty does not respect religion and requires liberal social policies to be taught in schools.
But so far, the party has not decided to withdraw from the convention.

According to Russian experts familiar with the aforementioned upgrading work, the “predecessor” of the “Super Alligator”, the Kamov Ka-52, was officially commissioned in November 2011, but defects were discovered during use, so the upgrading was designed to for “address the defects”.
The report claimed that, in comparison with the Kamov Ka-52, the Kamov Ka-52M would partially use new armor materials which would not increase its weight, the seat of pilots would be consolidated with new equipment to defend against missile attacks to increase the possibility of survival in the battlefield, and it also has: a stronger power generator to generate electricity for more complex airborne electronic equipment; upgraded light and electricity systems, which detect and identify targets in the battlefield at great distances; new light missiles with multiple uses to mainly attack armored vehicles and reinforced concrete fortifications at a range of up to 20 kilometers, double the range of the same missile used in the current helicopter; and defensive weapons and communication equipment will be commonly used with Mi-28NM, which is able to attack targets in the air to make protection work more convenient and economical.
Besides, the Kamov Ka-52M will have more advanced electronic guidance systems, weapons targeting systems, and navigation equipment.
Russian experts also said that the Kamov Ka-52M would be equipped with communication equipment to connect with UAV’s to obtain real-time information transmitted by nearby airborne unmanned drones, so for instance, it can display photos taken by UAV’s on its cabin screen.
According to the plan, the Kamov Ka-52M pilot will directly operate the coordinated UAV’s to improve their command of the battlefield and the guidance of long-distance missiles.
It is reported by Russian media that Alexei Krivoruchko, Vice Minister of the Russian Defense Ministry, said in December last year that Russian Defense Ministry was projected to purchase over 110 Kamov Ka-52M helicopters by 2027.

Ecological water restoration of 1.75 billion cubic meters to rivers and lakes has been realized in Hebei Province so far this year -Ecns.cn
SHIJIAZHUANG, July 26 (Xinhua, by Wang Kun) According to the Department of Water Resources of Hebei Province, since this year, Hebei Province has been coordinating the water diverted from rivers and local reservoirs to implement ecological water replenishment of a total of 1.75 billion cubic meters to 28 rivers and lakes including Hutuo River, Tang River, Juma River, and Baiyang Lake.
Hebei Province seized the opportunity to increase the flow of water from the South-to-North Water Diversion Middle Route Project and implemented ecological water replenishment to rivers such as the Tang River, the Sha River, and the Zhulong River with the diverted river water.
Meanwhile, nine large and medium-sized reservoirs, Xidayang Reservoir and Dongwushi reservoir for example, and Baiyang Lake supplied water to rivers such as Fuyang River and Qinglong River, creating a total water surface area of over 90 square kilometers.
In order to do a good job of ecological water replenishment, the Department of Water Resources of Hebei Province actively organizes the investigation of hidden hazards, rectification and reinforcement, and river cleaning work to strengthen inspection and management with detailed and practical implementation measures.
Through supervision, inspection, and intensive & secret inquiries, various problems were resolved in time to ensure the safe and smooth replenishment work.
According to the person in charge of the relevant division in the Department of Water Resources of Hebei Province, the smooth ecological water replenishment effectively restored the ecological environment of rivers and lakes in Hebei Province, and was also conducive to the replenishment and nourishment of groundwater along the river bank; besides greatly improving the living and economic development environment, it is deeply significant in the process of realizing the goal of "clear water, green shores, unobstructed courses, and beautiful scenery" for managing and protecting rivers and lakes.
(Deutsche Welle Chinese) Over the past two weeks, the number of new confirmed COVID-19 cases has risen sharply, with thousands of new cases over the past several days.
The UK government issued a temporary decision on Saturday evening (July 25th) that starting on the 26th, local time, Spain will be removed from the travel corridors list, and that people entering the UK from Spain must quarantine for 14 days.
UK tourists on vacation in Spain expressed surprise, worry, and anger when they heard about the decision, as the sudden news caught them off guard.
Reports state that UK Transportation Secretary Grant Shapps is currently vacationing in Spain.
Prior to the UK’s announcement of the new quarantine measures, Norway also announced that people traveling to Norway from Spain would need to isolate for 10 days.
France and Belgium advised their residents to preemptively cancel any vacation plans in Barcelona and its surrounding areas.
The overcrowding on beaches in these areas makes it impossible to maintain social distancing, and police have been required to take measures to reduce the number of tourists on beaches.
Tourism is one of Spain’s most important industries.
Spain: This is a safe place.
In response to the UK’s decision, Spain’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs expressed on Sunday that the country’s epidemic was under control.
Spanish Foreign Minister Arancha Gonzalez Laya stated to the media, “Spain is a safe place, not just for Spanish citizens, it’s also safe for tourists. “
Spain’s government will make attempts to persuade the UK government that the Balearic Islands and Canary Islands should be excluded from the quarantine measures.
Their reasoning is that the infection rate in these two tourist destinations is significantly lower than in the UK.
The Catalonia region of Spain has also reinstated its “football ban” to curb the epidemic.
Tourism is one of Spain’s pillar industries, and the country is one of the most popular vacation destinations for UK tourists
The UK’s decision is expected to have a significant impact on Spain’s tourism industry.

First day of Zhongfu: Escaping the intense heat as the rainy days start in Beijing -- Xinhua Net
BEIJING, July 26, 2020 (Xinhua, by Ni Yuanjin) July 26 marks the beginning of “Zhongfu (the second phase of Sanfu)” this year.
During the small hours of July 26, the convective weather caused by strong wind and sudden downpours dispersed the intense heat that had lasted for several days; the rain will last for another several days.
According to the report from the Beijing Meteorological Service released at 11:00 on July 26, there will be scattered showers on July 26 in Beijing (with weak thunder and lightning), and the highest temperature will be just 27 degrees Celsius; at night, it will be cloudy with light to moderate rain (with weak thunder and lightning), and the lowest temperature will be 23 degrees Celsius.
However, on July 24 and 25, Beijing was under a blue alert for high temperature; the highest temperature of most regions was 37 degrees Celsius, while some regions were even hotter, with a temperature of over 40 degrees Celsius.
Sanfu is the period with the highest temperature and humidity within a year, consisting of “three phases” every year, the second of which is the hottest, the period when people “lose their appetites”.
As the sanfu days draw near, people always fill their homes with diverse grains, and “eating dumplings for the first phase of Sanfu, while eating noodles for the second” is a long-lasting folk custom.
According to current weather reports, in the next three days, there will be clouds and rain in Beijing.
The meteorological service reminds us that mountain tours should be reduced in case of geological disasters.
It is estimated that the second phase of Sanfu will last for 20 days, from July 26 to August 14.
During these days, people always feel feeble and have no appetite.
Therefore, mung beans and coix seeds should be eaten to clear the heat, invigorate the spleen, and stimulate the appetite, and bitter foods such as sow thistle and bitter gourd can also be eaten for the same functions.
FAA launches urgent investigation of 2,000 passenger jets due to possible engine stalling - Xinhuanet
On the 24th, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued an emergency Airworthiness Directive demanding an urgent inspection of the roughly 2,000 737NG and 737 Classic airliners registered in the US due to the fact that corrosion of the airliners’ air check valves may cause the engines to stall while in midair.
The FAA said it has received reports of 4 incidents of 737NG and 737 Classic aircraft engines stalling in midair, so it has issued the emergency inspection order for all passenger aircraft that have been idled for 7 days or more or reactivated aircraft which have made fewer than 11 flights.
The FAA warned that if the Level 5 check valves in both engines of a passenger airliner become corroded, they may become stuck in the open position, causing the aircraft to completely lose power and be unable to restart its engines.
The regulatory agency’s order stipulates that if a check valve is found to be corroded, this critical component must be immediately replaced by the operator before the airplane may be returned to service.
Boeing responded later the same day, saying that because many aircraft had been idled or used less frequently due to the lower demand for travel caused by the COVID-19 epidemic, “which can make check valves more susceptible to corrosion”.
At the same time, Boeing stated it has advised all operators to immediately inspect aircraft affected by the order, and if problems are discovered, Boeing will provide repair, replacement air check valves, and similar assistance.
The AP reported that aircraft owned by major US carriers typically fly several times a day, but due to the COVID-19 epidemic, a large number of airlines have been idled; as return for travel has gradually started to return, some of these aircraft have been returned to service.
Details of the 4 reported stalling incidents were not released by the FAA.
Later on the 24th, Alaska Airlines disclosed that one of the incidents occurred on their aircraft.
The airline released a statement claiming that as its aircraft was flying from Seattle, Washington to Austin, Texas, one of the engines suddenly stalled, and the aircraft finally made an emergency landing in Austin.
Alaska Airlines said it had already replaced the aircraft’s engine and had inspected the engines of 6 more aircraft as directed by the FAA.
On the 24th, American Airlines, United Airlines, and Southwest Airlines stated they had not experienced air check valve-related engine stalling on their aircraft.
Four American Airlines aircraft will be inspected, and 28 United Airlines aircraft will be inspected.
Delta Airlines declared that it will inspect the 20 affected aircraft it operates, but that no stalling incidents had occurred on its aircraft.
Reports from several press bureaus note that the FAA emergency Airworthiness Directive was another blow to Boeing.
Indonesia’s Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines each experienced a Boeing 737 Max crash in October 2018 and March 2019, respectively, with a total of 346 fatalities.
Flights of this model were subsequently grounded globally, production ceased in January of this year, and was resumed in May of this year.
FAA Administrator Stephen Dickson admitted in June that the FAA “made a mistake” in its supervision of the 737 Max.

Chief Secretary for Administration of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region: all-out efforts to combat epidemic at critical juncture -Ecns.cn
HONG KONG, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Chief Secretary for Administration of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Matthew Cheung Kin-chung said on July 26 that the situation of COVID-19 in Hong Kong continued to be severe, and if the epidemic turned worse, the HKSAR Government would decisively enact more stringent control measures to further restrict business operations and reduce the activity space for people.
But at present, the SAR government has no intention to enact a "Stay-at-Home Order" or "Restriction Order" that restrict people from going out.
Cheung Kin-chung published a weblog post on the same day entitled All-out efforts to combat epidemic at critical juncture.
He said the current wave of the outbreak was the most serious one over the past six months and the coming fortnight would be crucial in the fight against further spread of the coronavirus in the community.
While the Government would take all necessary measures in this battle, it was equally important for the public to exercise self-discipline and cooperation.
He earnestly urged members of the public to stay home as much as possible, minimize social contact, and refrain from dining out.
In compliance with the compulsory measures, citizens should wear a face mask to protect themselves and others while observing personal and environmental hygiene and washing their hands frequently, and should also suspend non-essential social or meal gatherings and reduce their visits to markets.
He emphasized that the Central Authorities had all along taken heed of the changes in Hong Kong’s epidemic situation and staunchly supported the anti-epidemic work of the HKSAR Government, and in response to the recent request of the Chief Executive, the Central Authorities offered timely assistance in enhancing the virus testing capacity and retrofitting AsiaWorld-Expo into a makeshift facility similar to the “mobile cabin hospital” on the Mainland.
Meanwhile, he stated that the Government’s initiative to provide free COVID-19 testing for designated high-risk groups was running at full steam, which would cover some 400,000 persons including staff of residential care homes for the elderly (RCHEs), residential care homes for persons with disabilities, as well as nursing homes, restaurant workers, taxi drivers, and property management staff.
He was very concerned about the recent emergence of local infection cases in RCHEs, so to meet such needs, the Government has arranged to set up designated temporary quarantine centers.
He also said that quarantine facilities were being built in the vicinity of Penny’s Bay Quarantine Center at Lantau Island, and 700 additional units were expected to be available by the end of September.
The Chief Executive also announced on the 19th that the Government would build an additional 2,000 units at Penny’s Bay and strive to complete them by the end of this year.
With the commissioning of 800 quarantine units constructed on the Government land, the total number of quarantine units provided at Penny’s Bay will add up to 3,500.
Currently, a total of about 2,600 units are in operation under four quarantine centers in Hong Kong.
Besides, Lei Yue Mun Park and Holiday Village on Hong Kong Island has been converted into community isolation facilities since July 24 for COVID-19 patients who are under the age of 50 with self-care capabilities.
"Nutrients" for Implementing the History of the Party and New China-Ecns.cn
2020-07-26 17:37:29 Source: www.ce.cn Author: Zhu Yanjing Editor: Zhu Yanjing
In recent days, General Secretary Xi Jinping said while visiting the Siping Battle Memorial Hall, “It is necessary for 1.4 billion people and more than 90 million party members, especially leading cadres at all levels, to learn the history of the Communist Party of China and the history of New China well. "
Studying the history of the Party and the history of New China is a compulsory course for party members and cadres to stay true to the original aspiration and founding mission; we should draw rich nourishment from history, build a strong sense of family and country, and walk the long march of the new era.
The magnificent history of the Party and New China records the hard work and glorious history of the Communist Party of China since its founding, and demonstrates the faith and loyalty that the Communists have forged with their lives and blood, as well as the original aspiration and founding mission that they will always adhere to.
History is the best textbook, and for members and cadres of the Party, the history of Party and New China are the brightest chapters in this textbook.
Every member and cadre of the Party must continuously strengthen their historical thinking of using history as a mirror and moving towards the future, based on the new journey and new mission, accept the "relay baton" of the times, and walk the long march of the new era.
We must cast the soul with history, and stick to the original mission in the study of the history of the Party and New China.
Looking through the history of the Party and New China, we find it is full of the eternal and unchanging original aspiration and founding mission of the Chinese Communists and the adherence to rock-solid convictions, which demonstrates the simple desire of the Communists to walk with the people forever.
To understand important events, important meetings, and important figures in the history of the Party and New China up close is not only an intuitive baptism of thought, but also a deep understanding of the connotations of the original aspiration and the weight of the founding mission.
For the Party members and cadres, if they want to continuously forge their original aspiration and founding mission and maintain their advanced qualities, they must find the starting point and the fulcrum of our original intention from the history of the Party and New China, maintain a clear understanding and a firm stand, and find the strength to fight bravely for the country and the people and ensure that the red world their revolutionary ancestors laid down with their blood and lives will be passed on from generation to generation.
Studying history can make people wise, so we can inherit the noble spirit in the study of the history of the Party and New China.
Since the founding of the Communist Party of China, it has successively shaped a series of great spirits such as the Red Boat Spirit, the Jinggangshan Spirit, the Long March Spirit, the Yan'an Spirit, the Anti-Japanese War Spirit, the Xibaipo Spirit, the "Two Bombs and One Satellite" Spirit, and the Aerospace Spirit.
These great spirits precipitated by history have provided the Party with a powerful spiritual incentive to overcome various risks and challenges on the way forward, and are a precious spiritual wealth that cannot be defeated, washed away, or taken away.
The process of studying the history of the Party and China is a process of reviewing these spirits and shaping one's own spirit; we must conscientiously use the lofty spirit of the revolutionary ancestors as a mirror, stay true to the spiritual home of the Communists, and lay a solid spiritual foundation for advancing the great cause and realizing the great dream, and we should also inherit and carry forward these spirits, and make them glow with the light of the new era.
Reading history can make people reflect; we must continue to preserve righteousness and dispel evil in the study of the history of the Party and New China, .
For Party members and cadres, there has never been any history that can deliver more profound warning, enlightenment, and reference than the history of the Party and New China.
In the history of the Party and New China, we can see the great deeds of the older generation of revolutionaries who were determined to devote themselves to their faith and persevere in striving to achieve the established goals, but we also see the profound lessons of certain figures who were shaken in their ideals and beliefs and came to the opposite side of the revolution, which enlighten and warn us never to stop or slack off in our firm determination and will, always maintain a strong fighting spirit, continuously purify the spirit of the Party, and be self-disciplined.
To truly become a firm believer and loyal practitioner of the lofty ideals of communism, one needs to clean off ideological “dust” and guard against “dirt”; the history of the Party and New China should become the basis for every Party member and cadre to examine and warn himself.
Knowing history can inspire people; we should bravely take on the important tasks of the times in the study of the history of the Party and New China.
General Secretary Xi Jinping once pointed out, "Learning the history of the Party and the country is a compulsory course for upholding and developing socialism with Chinese characteristics and continuing to advance the various undertakings of the Party and the country. "
Looking back at history and seeking our original aspirations allows us to maintain our glory and move towards a bright future.
Every Party member and cadre should adopt the study of the history of the Party and New China as lifelong pursuit, constantly set the course of life in their studies, and bravely assume the historical mission, dare to assume responsibility, and act proactively in our respective jobs.
We should adhere to the reference and guidance of the advanced deeds of the older generation of revolutionaries, constantly refine the political nature of the communists, maintain the attitude of struggle in seizing the day and making every effort, and the spirit of struggle in spite of the difficulties and hardships; in the great journey of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, we must write a brilliant stroke of our own.
“The Great Wall of Jiangnan”, seeking the poetry of the “Yellow River Dream” - chinanews.com
(China poverty reduction story) “The Great Wall in Jiangnan”, seeking the poetry of the “Yellow River Dream”
China News Service, Yinchuan, reported July 26 (Yang Di) “Countless li of sands along the Yellow River’s endless turns as waves and wind rush onward from the horizon. “
The Yellow River, which has inspired the passions of countless poets, birthed the beautiful and bountiful Ningxia Plain, and today, Ningxia, which bears the fond epithet “The Great Wall of Jiangnan”, upholds the concept of “environment first, green development” as it pursues the poetry of the “Yellow River Dream”.
The “Jade Dream” of clear river water
“The Yellow River brings all under heaven to enrich Ningxia” as it runs its 397 km course through the province, making it the “mother river” that provides the region’s resources.
However, because of rapid industrialization and urbanization, the utilization, management, and protection of rivers and lakes has become imbalanced, with factors such as excessive sewage, land reclamation, and invasive practices leading to black and smelly waters, declining water quality, dirty natural environments, and ecological degradation.
Today, Ningxia is working to restore a wide variety of water bodies, and striving to make the Yellow River flow with clear, beautiful water.
Treating the waters begins at the source.
In Ningxia’s Yinchuan, through a “raising standards + cleaning up pollution + strict management” method, all wastewater from industrial parks is collected and treated, all urban water treatment plants have achieved Class A discharge standards, bodies of dark and smelly water in built-up urban areas have essentially been eliminated, and the city’s application to be included in the Third Batch of China Model Cities for Dark and Odorous Water Management has been approved.
In addition, in 2017, Ningxia comprehensively implemented its long-distance lakes and rivers management regulation, and has now achieved full coverage of its five-level responsibility system for these regulations across all urban and rural areas, meaning that long-distance river and lake patrols have become a common site.
Gu Jincheng, 64, a resident of a village near the Yellow River, has personally witnessed the river’s transformation, and says, “The water used to stink, but after cleaning and treatment, the smell is gone. “
He says that with an improved environment, his life has become more comfortable, and he now often takes walks with his relatives by the Yellow River, where they appreciate the clear water and blue skies.
The “Wetland Dream” of sand and circling gulls
Birds, green trees, wooden roads, clear water... the beautiful Ningxia scenery described in Fan Zhongyan’s “Sand, Geese, and Feathers Chronicle” has become a reality in the Yellow River Wetland Park in Yinchuan, Ningxia.
As the Yellow River flows through Ningxia, it forms river wetlands, lake wetlands, marsh wetlands, and other wetlands along its route, which play a critical role in the rational management of water resources and maintaining ecological balance, and internationally, have also become important stops on the migration routes of birds.
Since 2009, the related departments in Ningxia have invested a total of 3.45 billion RMB in wetland protection projects; presently, Yinchuan’s wetlands cover 19,200 hectares, of which 78.5% are protected areas; Yinchuan has nearly 200 natural lakes and marsh wetlands, has 5 national wetland parks, 1 national urban wetland park, 6 autonomous region wetland parks, and 8 municipal parks.
Deputy director of the Yinchuan Wetland Conservation Center Lu Jinhu expressed to this reporter that wetland protection has increased biodiversity, which is especially apparent in the variety of bird species, “The relict gull is endangered, with just over 20,000 left in the world, of which more than 2,000 nest in Yinchuan wetlands. “
Ningxia has also passed laws that delineate a 500-meter “red line” wetland protection zone on both sides of the Yellow River, and which bans all development, construction, and business activities in the protected zone except for public welfare projects.
Zhao Shaoyong, deputy director of Yinchuan Water Conservation Service Center, says that source management of pollution, overall restoration and improvement of lake and river ecosystems, and wetland terminal construction, 100% of the water flowing in Ningxia’s 9 major drainage channels into the Yellow River reaches Class IV standards, and he adds, “Now the water is clear, fish swim in it, and flowers bloom around it. “
The “Drinking Water Dream” of universal livelihood improvement
Yinchuan in Ningxia once bore an “awkward” honorific: the only city to look out on the banks of the Yellow River that lacks drinking water.
Starting in 2010, Yinchuan faced perennial water shortages during the peak summer season, and over the past decade, this water shortage has become a painful summer experience for many high-rise dwellers, but with all major water sources extremely stressed and the city’s drilling and exploitation of huge areas of groundwater, water shortages were a significant problem for Yinchuan.
But thanks to the improvements in the quality of the Yellow River’s water, purifying the river water has become a way to supply drinking water to local residents.
Ding Ming, deputy director of Yinchuan Water Affairs Bureau, said that to meet Yinchuan’s demand for residential water, Ningxia initiated the Yinchuan Municipal Western Water Supply Line project in time to replace the city’s original groundwater supply with high-quality water from the Yellow River.
“The project officially began supplying water to Yinchuan on December 29, 2019, and in 2020, the residents of Minning Town and Helan County also began to drink Yellow River water.” “
Ding Ming said that the Yinchuan Water Conservation Department is considering integrating urban water supply and rural drinking water provision, stating, “Our next step is to integrate the scattered water supplies in rural areas and connect them to the Western Water Supply Line Project, and by the end of the year, we expect to essentially integrate all of Yinchuan’s urban and rural water supply systems. “
To Reinforce Accountability, All Departments to Consolidate Flood Control and Relief Efforts-ChinaNews.com
To Reinforce Accountability, All Departments to Consolidate Flood Control and Relief Efforts
From cctv.com(CCTV News): According to information from Ministry of Water Resources, at noon today (July 25), water levels at the section below Wangjiaba on the Huaihe River main stream exceeded the warning level by 0.64 to 3.31 meters, and water levels below Shashi City on the mid and lower main stream of the Yangtze River and in Hunan and Hubei provinces the warning level by 0.05 to 2.02 meters.
Since Taihu Lake first went over the warning water level on June 28, it has remained so for 28 days.
At 12:00pm today, the average water level of Taihu Lake was 4.67 meters, 0.02 meters over the safe water level.
Today, after thorough discussion and judgment, State Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters decided to maintain the Level II Response for Yangtze River and Huaihe River flood control, meaning all jurisdictions are to be held accountable for further implementing flood control and disaster relief measures.
Today, the Office of State Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters and Ministry of Emergency Management dispatched specialist drainage vehicles from Shangdong, Zhejiang, and Fujian to help Jiangxi with problems like urban waterlogging caused by the heavy rainfall.
The United States Launches an Anti-Subsidy Investigation Against China with "Undervalued RMB Exchange Rate" for the First Time
The US Department of Commerce recently announced that it has decided to initiate anti-dumping and anti-subsidy investigations into Chinese strapping products, as well as an investigation on the "undervalued RMB exchange rate" project.
China's Ministry of Commerce pointed out that this is the first time that the United States has launched an anti-subsidy case to investigate the so-called "undervalued RMB exchange rate" project, and China is firmly opposed to this.
China's Ministry of Commerce issued a special press release on the evening of the 23rd, saying that China implements a managed floating exchange rate regime based on market supply and demand, with reference to a basket of currencies, and that the market plays a decisive role in the formation of exchange rates.
“On the whole, the RMB exchange rate is at a reasonable and balanced level and is not undervalued,” the press release stressed.
Since 2005, the RMB has appreciated by more than 17% against the US dollar.
According to data released by the Bank for International Settlements, from the beginning of 2005 to May 2020, the nominal effective exchange rate of RMB appreciated by 38% and the real effective exchange rate by 49%, making it the most powerful currency among the G20 economies and one of the currencies with the highest appreciation in the world.
The Ministry of Commerce pointed out that the exchange rate issue goes beyond the members' authority to conduct anti-subsidy investigations in accordance with the WTO rules.
In February this year, the United States amended its laws and regulations to conduct anti-subsidy investigations into other countries' exchange rates, which is suspected of violating WTO rules and has been opposed by many parties.
Even under U.S. regulations, the applicant's complaint contains a number of errors and lacks the necessary anti-subsidy elements such as financial aid, grant of benefits and exclusivity, the press release said.
China urges the US to abide by existing international rules and stop conducting anti-subsidy investigations on the so-called "undervalued RMB exchange rate".
The offshore and onshore RMB exchange rates fell sharply against the US dollar on the 22nd, both falling below the mark of USD $1 to RMB 7.0 as tensions between China and the US escalated.
It is a matter of concern whether the U.S. Department of Commerce's move is intended to push up the RMB.
The spot exchange rate of the RMB against the US dollar rose above 7.0 on the 23rd, closing at 6.9961.
The central parity rate of the RMB against the US dollar, which is regulated by the government, fell 17 basis points to 6.9938 on the 24th.

Chen Baoguo, Huang Lei, and Sun Honglei are all highly experienced middle-aged actors, while 37 year-old Lei Jiayin is also a very talented actor, and 32 year-old Zhang Ruoyun is the youngest nominee.
In 2016, 34-year-old Hu Ge won the Magnolia Award for Best Actor for “Nirvana in Fire”, making him the youngest recipient of the award, but if Zhang Ruoyun can beat out his predecessors this year, he will set a new record.

Yangtze River’s Third Flood of 2020 Formed, Detailed and Practical Measures Taken by the Ministry of Water Resources - China News
Beijing, July 26 (Xinhua, Hu Lu) On July 26, the Yangtze River’s third flood of 2020 formed.
E Jingping, chief minister of the Ministry of Water Resources of the PRC, called for detailed regulation of the Three Gorges reservoir, overall considerations of the water from the upper reaches of the Yangtze River and Dongting Lake, implementation of flood peak stagger regulation, sufficient storage capacity to prepare for possible major floods, and measures to ensure flood control safety for the main stream in the middle and lower reaches and the important dykes of Dongting Lake.
It is predicted that over the next three days, there will be heavy rain and rainstorms in the eastern part of Southwest China, the southern part of Yangtze and Huaihe River, the northern and western parts of the regions south of the Yangtze River, the southern and eastern parts of Hubei Province, and the central part of Guangxi Province, among which there will be heavy rain in the northern part of Hunan Province and the southwestern part of Jiangsu Province; moderate to heavy rain is expected in the western part and central part of North China, among which there will be rainstorms in the central part of Hebei Province.
The Ministry of Water Resources estimated that the inflow of the Three Gorges reservoir in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River may reach 60,000 cubic meters per second around July 28, and the water level of Lianhuatang River and Dongting Lake in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River would rise again and exceed the safety water level by 0.20 meters; the water level of the main stream in the middle reaches of the Huaihe River would slow down, and the water level of Hongze Lake would continue to rise; the water level of Haihe River, Daqing River system, Yongding River, and other rivers would also rise.
E Jingping pointed out that the Huaihe River Basin should further increase flood discharge, reduce the water level of Hongze Lake as soon as possible, and prepare for possible flooding.
Preparations should be made for dealing with the rainstorms and flooding in the Yi-Shu-Si River Basin.
He said that the Taihu Lake Basin should continue to increase flood discharge, reduce the water level of Taihu Lake and its surrounding river network as soon as possible, and reduce the risk of high water levels in Taihu Lake during the typhoon season.
In addition, he stressed that in northern China, such as Inner Mongolia and Hebei, floods rise and fall sharply, and the warning time is short, which means flash floods and debris flows are likely, making prevention difficult; there are also many small and medium reservoirs and silt arresters, which pose safety risks.

Lewis family: John Lewis was a “fighter for the least of us”
At a memorial service held in his remembrance on Saturday, July 25th, US Congressperson and civil rights activist John Lewis was described as a “fighter for the least of us”.
Public memorial services for Lewis have been open to the public since Saturday in Alabama.
On the first day, two memorial services were held.
At the memorial service held on Saturday at Alabama’s Troy University, Lewis’s five brothers and sisters and one grandson described him as a deeply caring and courageous family man.
Lewis’s younger brother, Henry “Grant” Lewis, said at the service, “He dedicated his life to the service of others. “
Samuel Lewis said his mother warned Lewis, “Not to make trouble, don’t make trouble. “
He added that John ignored his mother’s warning, and continued, “We all knew John would always make trouble, always get into trouble, but it was always to stand up for the right thing, so it was a good trouble. “
Lewis’s brothers and sisters told those in attendance at the service that John’s most famous point of argument was that people should create “good trouble”, which is to say that he would never shy away from causing trouble for the sake of justice.
John once applied to Troy University in Troy, Alabama, where he was born, but he was rejected because it was an all-white school at the time.
John Lewis, who preached to chickens on his family farm as a child, finally earned his degree in religion and philosophy at Fisk University.
Several years later, he was awarded an honorary doctorate from Troy University.
Alabama Senator Doug Jones said current protestors are “protesting peacefully and non-violently”, just as John Lewis protested during the Civil Rights Movement.
Jones continued, “Even though President Trump tarred all the protesters with the same brush by describing them as thugs, he was wrong.
The protesters are patriots who want America to become a more equal country. “
The six-day series of events to remember Lewis’s life will conclude with a funeral in Georgia this week.
On Saturday, Lewis’s coffin was exhibited at a public memorial service at Troy University, where members of the public came to pay their respects to this civil rights pioneer.
Later, on Saturday evening, a private memorial service was held for people to pay their respects at a church in Selma, Alabama, after which a private memorial service was held.
On Sunday, Lewis’s remains will be carried across Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma.
In 1965, Lewis and several other demonstrators demanding the right to vote for Blacks were beaten viciously by Alabama police on this bridge, and the police also fired tear gas into the crowd.
Lewis was nearly killed by his injuries.
Later, that day became known as “Bloody Sunday”.
Then, Lewis’s remains will be shipped to Alabama’s capital city Montgomery.
Mayor Steven Reed encouraged people to line up on the sidewalk to complete Lewis’s final journey with him.
However, officials also reminded participants that they should wear masks and maintain social distance.
Alabama Governor Kay Ivey ordered that the state flag be flown at half-mast on Saturday and Sunday in honor of Lewis’s memory.
During the near-week of memorial events, Lewis’s remains will briefly visit the Alabama State Capitol in Montgomery, the Georgia State Capitol in Atlanta, and the U.S. Capitol Building in Washington to allow members of the public to express condolences.
Last week, Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced that members of the public can visit the U.S. Capitol Building on Monday or Tuesday to pay their respects to Lewis.
Public memorial events for Lewis will be held outdoors due to the coronavirus epidemic.
Shenzhen Government Asks for Public Opinion On Health Regulations to Be Published -- Xinhua Net

Recently, the Health Regulations of Shenzhen Special Economic Zone (draft for comments) was officially published, meaning citizens of Shenzhen will have their own “Health Law”.
In order to encourage local residents to perform a physical evaluation to detect abnormalities as early as possible, the draft for comments proposed that heath agencies should establish a basic catalogue for physical evaluation programs based on factors including age and job.
Personal physical evaluation fees covered by the basic catalogue should be paid annually by social and medical insurance funds.
The draft for comments clarified that, the employers should arrange their human resources appropriately, reasonably coordinating their time schedule, and to prevent staff spending too much physical and mental efforts at work, a rotating schedule should be well-implemented, so that issues due to excessive physical and mental exertion can be avoided, and also strictly implement a paid leave system.
In addition, the employers should employ full-time and part-time health staff, and organize physical evaluations for staff regularly.
In terms of the physical and mental health of minors, the draft for comments prohibited the sales of alcohol beverage to minors, with the restriction of sales places, and proposed that those who disobey the rules will be asked to correct themselves by Market Supervisory Authorities and be fined RMB 30,000.
Apart from “no alcohol”, the minors should also “exercise more”.
According to the requirements of the draft for comments, schools should allow more than one hour for student physical activities.
In terms of online games, authorities including the police, cultural broadcast tourism sports, online supervision, health, and so on should improve the health supervision systems of online service providers and venues amd build a health censorship system for online games to establish healthy communication environment and etiquette for the adolescents.
Beyond that, the public comment draft also pointed out that flu patients must wear masks when entering public venues, and if health institutions leak the private information of patients, they will be fined RMB 20,000.
One thing worthy of attention apart from the physical and mental health of residents is that the draft for comments also required that before making plans and regulatory documents related to urban space planning and construction, industrial park plan and construction, resource exploration and environmental protection, the development of Biological Medicine, alongside approving major construction projects and implementing major public service projects, departments of the Shenzhen government should evaluate the influence of those public policies upon people’s health.
Unevaluated policies or evaluated ones that would have severe side effects on urban public sanitation or people’s health should not be issued or approved for implementation.

Recently, General Secretary Xi Jinping emphasized during an inspection in Jilin province that it was necessary to strengthen the leadership of the Party, promote the extension of organizations of the Party to the most basic level, improve the work system of the New Party’s basic organizations, and provide a strong guarantee for the governance of urban and rural communities.
Adhering to the guidance of Party building and implementing the Party's leadership in all fields and links of grassroots social governance is the fundamental requirement of doing a good job in grassroots social governance.
To improve the level of grassroots social governance, we should adhere to the leadership of Party building, promote the transformation of the Party's political, organizational, and mass work advantages into governance advantages by strengthening political leadership, building a battle fortress, and condensing red forces, so as to transfer the Party's strength and ideas to the "nerve endings" and the "last mile".
We must pay attention to calcium supplementation and soul forging and strengthen political leadership.
To strengthen the political leadership of grassroots social governance, it is necessary to implement the "calcium supplementation and soul forging" project.
It is necessary to deeply study and thoroughly understand Xi Jinping’s thoughts on socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era as the primary task, take “remain true to our original aspiration and keep our mission firmly in mind” as the eternal theme of Party building and the lifelong theme of Party members and cadres, and strengthen the idea of reading the original work, learning the original text and understanding the principles; we should promote the solidification of the Party’s innovative theories through special training, batch training, seminars, exchanges, holding forums, and so on; and Party members and cadres should further enhance the "Four Consciousnesses", strengthen "Four-sphere Confidence", and achieve the "Two Upholds" to better perform their duties and responsibilities.
Through the combination of online and offline learning methods, we should broaden the channels of learning and education, and guide the grassroots Party organizations and Party members and cadres to truly and regularly integrate learning and education into their daily activities.
We should pay attention to practice and address the problematic and disturbing issues that the masses are concerned about, and forge the Party’s spirit and ability in the process of resolving key and difficult problems in the field of grassroots social governance,
We should improve our standards and play a key role in grassroots governance.
Grassroots Party organizations are not only an important part of the grassroots social governance system, but also an important carrier for the manifestation of governance capabilities.
To promote the standardized construction of grassroots Party organizations, we should start by grasping the regulations on the work of Party branches and addressing the problem of the leadership of Party organizations being weak and ineffective; we must consolidate the foundation, reduce the weaknesses, and promote development by establishing an up-down linkage mechanism, innovating the form of branch establishment, normalizing the weak and lax parts, establishing and improving decision-making and discussion mechanisms, and the mechanisms of serving the masses.
In rural areas, we should strengthen the standardization-building of village level Party organizations, standardize organizational forms, learning activities, and management mechanism in accordance with the standardization construction standards of Party branches, and earnestly promote the detailed implementation of “the system of holding Party branch general meetings, meetings of Party branch committees, Party group meetings, and Party lectures" and thematical Party activities.
In terms of urban governance, we should pay attention to sub-district communities, explore and innovate the form of branch establishment, focus on weak areas, "blocking points", and "pain points", and actively build the urban Party-building alliance to realize effective coverage of the Party's work.
At the same time, we should establish and improve the systems and mechanisms of grassroots social governance, improve the decision-making and discussion mechanisms for discussing major issues, doing practical things, deciding important matters, discussing urgent matters, and solving difficult matters led by grassroots Party organizations; we should improve the mechanisms of Party members and cadres to contact and serve the masses, gather people's hearts in serving the people, and enhance the sense of gain, happiness, honor, and pride of the masses to make grassroots social governance more enticing.
We should play a vanguard role and gather red power.
Grassroots party members and cadres are the cornerstone of grassroots social governance.
To improve grassroots social governance capabilities, we should focus on improving the governance capabilities of grassroots Party members and cadres, on the demonstration and leading role of "red cells" in grassroots social governance, and on gathering red forces at the forefront of contacting and serving the masses.
It is necessary to take the improvement of governance ability as a compulsory course for grassroots Party members and cadres, constantly strengthen ideological refinement, professional training, and practical training, the spirit of carrying forward the spirit of responsibility in their posts and in urgent, difficult, and dangerous tasks, and lay a solid foundation for and contribute to the modernization of the national governance system and governance capabilities.
It is necessary to extensively carry out the activities of "community whistleblowing, party members reporting", through participating in thematic Party activities, contacting people in difficult situations, determining service projects, acknowledging micro-desires, and making reasonable suggestions, to participate in community construction, management, and service, so that Party members can play a role in community governance.
It is necessary to give full play to the role of unemployed Party members in rural areas, and guide the majority of grassroots Party members to actively participate in poverty alleviation, ecological construction, petitioning and stability maintenance, and banning straw burning by setting up unemployed Party member vanguard posts and forming unemployed Party member work teams to better integrate red forces and serve the people.
The foundation is solid and the building is firm.
The grassroot Party organization is the foundation of the “ruling” building.
Only by persisting in focusing on the close relationship between the Party and the masses, increasing the well-being of the people, and taking the leadership of Party building as the fundamental way to promote the innovation and development of grassroots social governance can we build a firm foundation and make grassroots Party organizations stable, make grassroots Party members and cadres responsible, and make grassroots governance spiritual, orderly, powerful, and effective.

Tibetan antelope migration season arrives in Hoh Xil
Xinhua News Agency, Xining, reported July 25th (Correspondent: Wang Jinjin) This reported learned from the Sanjiangyuan National Park Administration Yangtze River Origin Park Hoh Xil Management Office Wudaoliang Conservation Station, that monitoring data from the station shows that the rutting and birthing season for Tibetan antelopes which previously migrated to the Zhuonai Lake area in the hinterlands of Hoh Xil is ending, and that the young antelopes are now gradually returning to their original habitats.
Monitoring images from areas near the Wudaoliang Conservation Station show that on July 25th, about 40 female Tibetan antelopes leading 3 calves crossed Kilometer Marker 3002 on the Qinghai-Tibet Highway and the Wudaoliang North Bridge on the Qinghai-Tibet Railway, indicating that Tibetan antelopes have already begun their return migration.
According to experts, in recent years, Tibetan antelope calves have made up a fifth to a quarter of the total herd migrating along the return route.
Lian Xinming, associate researcher at the Chinese Academy of Sciences Northwest Plateau Biology Institute said, “During the return migration season, Tibetan antelopes are at higher risk of being hunted, so the number of calves is low, and sometimes there are none at all. “
Statistics from the Sanjiangyuan National Park Administration Yangtze River Origin Park Hoh Xil Management Office show that the number of Tibetan antelopes on the return migration route has been increasing each year, with 4,860 counted in 2019, an increase of 338 over 2018.
Lian Xinming said, “This year’s return migration of Tibetan antelopes is predicted to conclude in early September, and there is hope that the number will continue to rise. “
The Tibetan antelope is a national Level 1 protected species.
Each year in late May, Tibetan antelopes from areas Sanjiangyuan in Qinghai, Qiangtang in Tibet, the Altyn-Tagh mountain range in Xinjiang, and other areas migrate to Zhuonai Lake in the hinterland of Hoh Xil to breed and birth their calves.
According to Wu Xiaomin, a Chinese Tibetan antelope conservation expert and researcher at the Shaanxi Institute of Zoology (Northwestern Endangered Animals Research Institute), “The return migration of Tibetan antelopes is the process of female Tibetan antelopes leading their calves back to their original habitats after their birthing period. The herd that leaves the birthing ground is fairly large, but later, the Tibetan antelopes split into groups specific to different regions and return along separate routes to their original territories. “
This journalist learned that to ensure the safe return migration of Tibetan antelope herds, the Sanjiangyuan National Park Administration Yangtze River Origin Park Hoh Xil Management Office has arranged personnel to conduct continuing video surveillance and patrols along the primary migration routes.
If a herd is discovered attempting to cross a highway, the mountain patrol teams respond rapidly with traffic control measures to drive herds safely through wildlife crossings, so that they are disturbed by humans as little as possible during their migration.
So, how should we deal with heat in our daily lives?
According to experts, you should avoid going outside during the hottest part of the day during summer and avoid walking or labor in the sun before or after noon, because these periods of the day are when the sun is most intense and the possibility of heatstroke is highest.
If you can’t avoid going outside during these periods, take protection measures such as carrying a parasol, wearing a sun hat, wearing sunglasses, and applying sunscreen when possible to prevent burns.
For clothing, light-colored, breathable cotton, linen, and silk are best, while chemical fiber clothing should be avoided to prevent heatstroke due to insufficient heat dissipation when sweating profusely.
In hot, humid weather, have sufficient water ready and drink it before you feel thirsty, because feeling thirsty means your body is already dehydrated, while also ensuring that each mouthful is between 150-200ml, and drink warm, boiled water instead of ice-cold water.
Depending on temperature, the average person drinks 1.5-2L of water per day, while workers in high-temperature environments drink 3-5L per day.
At times of profuse sweating, add some salt to the water to make up for the salt your body loses through sweating.
In addition, the human body tends to be deficient in potassium in summer, which makes people feel tired and depleted, so drinking potassium-infused tea is an excellent way to relieve yourself from the heat.
During summer, eat vegetables with high water content such as lettuce, cucumber, tomatoes, as well as fresh fruit such as peaches, apricots, watermelons, and melons, all of which have water content between 80-90%, which is helpful for rehydration, while dairy products can both rehydrate and provide the body’s required nutrition.
People who work in high-temperature environments should also supplement their potassium, magnesium, and other nutrients with the appropriate beverages.
During the long days and short nights of summer, while temperatures are high, the body’s metabolism ramps up and consumes more calories, making it easy to feel tired.
Getting sufficient sleep relaxes brain’s and body’s systems, which is beneficial to both work and study, and is a good way to prevent heatstroke.
Experts say the best time to fall asleep is between 22:00-23:00, and the best time to wake up is between 05:30-06:30.
Take care not to lie under air-conditioning vents or electric fans while sleeping to avoid air-conditioning sickness and thermal colds.
Experts advise that people who exercise outdoors or work in high-temperature environments carry Shi Di Shui, Ren Dan, Huo Xiang Zheng Qi Shui, Huo Xiang Zheng Qi Wan, or other heatstroke prevention medicines to with them or place them around their work environment and use them often to prevent heatstroke.

During the pandemic, this exhibition is of unique significance.
Ge Ping, the person in charge of art display at Chaoyang District Joy City, said “We are bringing the ‘online’ graduation exhibition offline again, and we also hope to make more people see young people’s self-exploration and understanding of the outside world to magnify the healing role of art upon the society and heart. ”
She said that the exhibited art works are from graduates from several art colleges, among which the works suitable for display in business spaces were especially selected; the formats range from easel painting and sculpture to new media equipment, interactive flash and VR panoramas, making it the year’s most numerous and diverse exhibition by far.
Among the works, Li Yunxiao created The First War of 2020 using a mixed machine and manual production process to express his feelings of the pandemic; Liu Jiaying created Sound Money using the Ethereum block chain, which discusses themes including “cryptocurrency”, “credit creation”, and “transactions”; Cat Forest by Zhang Jiaqi and Barriers by Qiu Daqiang both describe how animals always stay with people, from which we can see how young artists comprehend the relationship between human beings and animals; the work The Winter of Belief -- Gift by Zhu Zhongyu reminds young people that “even if you achieve great success in career, do not forget your primary inspirations, and always remain innocent and sincere. ”
Among the few graduates participating in the placement of the exhibition, Li Jingyin is from the Department of Sculpture at the Tianjin Academy of Fine Arts.
“I arrived in Beijing on July 7, and at the time I was a little worried about the pandemic, so took the nucleic acid test three days in advance, and I came here with alcohol pads and my test report. ”
His art work The Mysterious Yesterday is complex in its structure, and took a lot of work to produce.
At the same time, he also helped others to remedy defects in their art.
“I was busy with placement until 4:30 a.m. and then worked on correcting defects, and the schedule was so tight that I even forgot to take photos with the works, which is a bit sad. ”
He hoped that, after the pandemic, he could go to see the exhibition of their works with his classmates.

Australian university develops new drug to treat COVID-19 blood vessel blockage - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Sydney, reported July 26 (Correspondent: Chen Yu) Researchers at Australia’s Monash University are developing a new drug to prevent stroke and heart disease, and it is hoped that the same drug can be used to treat blood vessel blockage caused by COVID-19.
The researchers discovered that prior to a heart attack or stroke, an enzyme present in platelets accelerates platelet clotting.
To target this, they are developing medicine to temporary inhibit platelet clotting as a way to avoid clogging blood vessels and thereby prevent heart disease and stroke.
They claim the drug’s inhibitive effect will only affect clotting when in the presence of signs of heart attack or stroke.
Studies indicate that such blood vessel blockage is a leading cause of death in severe COVID-19 cases, so the researchers hope this drug can be use to treat such severe cases in the future.
At present, the drug shows promising results in animal studies, and the researchers are preparing for the next phase of experiments, human trials.
The results of their research were recently published in the US magazine “Science Translational Medicine”.
He was the first spectator to enter a CBA venue after the league resume games and allowed in-person audiences.
On the day, at the second stage game of the 2019-2020 China Men’s Basketball Professional League (CBA) semifinals (Laoshan Division) in Qingdao, Shandong Province, medical personnel, teachers, and public security officers went through the official ticket platform procedures, including nucleic acid testing, and afterward, he entered the court to watch the Shanghai Sharks play the Shandong Heroes.
During the game, spectators were required to wear masks the whole time, sit in assigned seats, and maintain a one meter distance between seats.
While leaving, the audience was required to exit in an orderly fashion and maintain a distance of one meter from others on all sides.
Xinjiang Ploughs in “Sunflower Fields” to Take Advantage of Clean Energy-ChinaNews.com

CNS from Hami, Xinjiang, July 26 Xinjiang Ploughs in “Sunflower Fields” to Take Advantage of Clean Energy
Over 6,000 pentagon heliostats, 48 square meters each, lined up in circles like a field of silver sunflowers, turning with the sun and reflecting sunlight to the 200-meter heat absorption tower in the middle for power generation.
On the 25th, the reporter saw this view when visiting a CNEEC Hami molten salt tower solar power plant in Naomaohu Township of Yiwu County in Hami, Xinjiang.
“Molten salt tower solar power generation means to form thermal energy through specular concentrated sunlight reflection to the heat absorption tower, then turn the thermal energy into electricity through conventional power generation technology. ”
Zhang Yong , Vice GM of CNEEC Hami Solar Power Co., Ltd., said the design concept is similar to solar stoves used in Northwestern rural areas, which use concentrated sunlight.
Covering an area of 6,600 mu, the power plant, construction of which started in October 2017, was integrated into the grid at the end of last year, with a total of 14,500 heliostats ultimately to be installed.
“Compared to conventional solar power technology, its greatest advantage is to store collected thermal energy so that power generation can continue in the evening. ”
Zhang Yong said the 13-hour thermal storage system deployed at this project is not affected by sunlight changes, enabling continuous stable operation of the generator unit, and can also swiftly support power grid peak stabilization according to grid load peak and valley demands.
Annual power generation of the project will reach 198 million kwh when completed, saving over 60,000 tons of standard coal, cutting over 60 tons of sulfur dioxide emission, 60 tons of oxynitrides, 20 tons of dust and fumes, and over 150,000 tons of carbon dioxide while providing a steady flow of clean energy to the locals.
Aside from that, there is another silver sunflower field in Shichengzi Photovoltaic Industrial Park in Hami City.
The Hami Fuguang Solar Photovoltaic Power Plant covers an area of over 2,300 mu, with 714 generators following the sun to always maintain a 90 degree right angle between sunlight and panels.
“We use dual-axis tracking CPV technology that through integrated controls, ensures all power generating equipment adjusts its angle to the altitude of the sun to maintain generating efficiency. ”
Duan Mengqi, head of the power plant, said in good lighting weather, this technology improves efficiency by 20% compared to conventional photovoltaic power generation.
In the first half of this year, the power plant generated over 7 million kwh of electricity and supplemented local power demand.
Shichengzi Photovoltaic Industrial Park is currently the largest demonstration park with the most comprehensive photovoltaic component types, and it currently hosts 38 photovoltaic power generation projects with a total installed capacity of 820,000kw.
In the first half of this year, it generated 110 million kwh, an increase of 6% compared to 2019.
Hami is one of the regions that has the best solar energy resources in China.
Its average annual solar radiation is over 6,200 MJ per square meter, with around 3,200 annual sunshine hours.
In recent years, Hami has focused on developing its photovoltaic industry and established “sunflower fields”.
Installed solar power capacity is over 2.5 million kw, and its power generation exceeded 1.4 billion kwh in the first half of the year, 14% year-on-year growth.
At present, Xinjiang has more than 330 photovoltaic plants connected to the grid, with an installed capacity of over 10 million kw.
This year’s power generation is expected to be 15 billion kwh, which can replace over 6 million tons of standard coal.

U.S. Media Unveils U.S. Unwarranted Demand to Shut Down Chinese Consulate General In Huston-ChinaNews.com

U.S. Media Unveils U.S. Unwarranted Demand to Shut Down Chinese Consulate General In Huston
On the 24th of this month, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs notifies United States’ Embassy to China that it decided to revoke the license for the establishment and operation of the U.S. Consulate General in Chengdu, and outlines specific requirements to shut down all businesses and activities of the Consulate General in response to the sudden U.S. request to shut down the Chinese Consulate General in Houston on the 21st.
This action taken by the United States government has drawn broad attention, and its political motivation is questioned by foreign media and scholars.
What is the reason behind the demand for the Chinese Consulate General shutdown?
Several foreign media reported that the reason why the U.S. would select the Chinese Consulate General in Huston is unclear, but as to the purpose of this action, they stated straightforwardly that it was “for the election”.
According to a CNN report on the 23rd, the request to shut down the Chinese Consulate General in Houston made people question the United States’ political motives.
As the article states, U.S. government’s disastrous response to the COVID-19 pandemic has led to President Trump’s sluggish support rate in polls prior to the election.
White House officials’ private statements indicate that the tough position against China is to save Trump’s support rate as well as to shift the focus away from the White House’s failure in response to the pandemic.
The article believes Chinese Consulate General in Houston to be a “politically motivated and discreet” target chosen by the U.S. “to create a tough position while avoiding major conflicts”.
The BBC also believes that with the U.S. election around the corner and the U.S. economy suffering badly due to the pandemic, Trump sees “playing the ‘China card’ as politically beneficial”.
The current situation is a “spiraling tit for tat fight”, which, driven by U.S. government’s domestic considerations to some extent, will only worsen tensions between China and the U.S.
According to CBS, Trump’s prospects for a second term is under pressure because of the pandemic, and he has repeatedly pointed his finger at China for the outbreak.
The U.S. has almost daily new actions based on Trump’s absurd argument of so-called “China’s exploitation of the United States”.
“The Consulate General in Huston is important for building bilateral connections”
As stated by the AP, the U.S. request to shut down Chinese Consulate General will aggravate tensions between two of the world’s largest economies.
Besides the diplomatic impact, with the Chinese Consulate General in Houston shut down, Chinese citizens in the South will face difficulties accessing consular services, and so will U.S. citizens applying for visas or other services.
A business group in Huston expressed its regrets on this matter, saying the Consulate General plays a key role in bilateral trade, investment, and cultural connections.
The AP believes that it reflects the importance of China’s economy.
According to the Foreign Policy website, this action by the U.S. is “part of a series of provocative moves that will only aggravate U.S.-China relations”.
Reuters quoted Jonathan Pollack, East Asia expert of Brookings Institution, saying he couldn’t think of anything comparable to the United States action on the Chinese Consulate General in Houston since the two countries established diplomatic relations in 1979.
The South China Morning Post in Hong Kong calls the U.S. action unprecedented in the 40 years of China-U.S. diplomatic relations.
Analysts believe this action could cause lasting damage.
The Chinese Consulate General in Houston was established in 1979 as the first Chinese Consulate General opened in the United Stated.
Currently, China has one Embassy and five Consulate Generals in the United States.

Spokesperson of the Embassy of the People’s Republic of China in the UK: The Chinese Government is a Staunch Defender of Cyber Security-Ecns.cn
July 26, (Ecns.cn): According to the website of the Embassy of the People’s Republic of China in the UK, on the 25th, the spokesperson of the Embassy of the People’s Republic of China in the UK responded to reporters' questions about erroneous statements about cyber attacks.
The spokesperson emphasized that the Chinese government was a staunch defender of cyber security and has always resolutely opposed and combated any form of cyber attacks and cyber crimes.
A reporter stated that according to the media, hacker organizations related to China had interfered with the network system of a British company, launched attacks on British and American technology companies that had patented data, and invaded the government networks of EU countries.
The spokesperson said that the Chinese government was a staunch defender of cyber security and has always resolutely opposed and combated any form of cyber attacks and cyber crimes.
Cyberspace is highly virtual, and it’s difficult to trace with diverse actors, meaning sufficient evidence should be presented when investigating and identifying cyber incidents, and no unreasonable guesses should be made.
The spokesperson said that a series of incidents such as "Prism" in the past proved that the United States has been conducting the world's largest cyber theft.
Maintaining peace and stability in cyberspace was in line with the common interest of all countries.
The spokesperson pointed out that China's achievements in technological innovation were not stolen or robbed, but were obtained through self-reliance and perseverance.
In 2019, China submitted about 59,000 patent applications through the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT), with an annual growth rate of 10.6%, making it the country with the largest number of international patent applications.
China has become a country of innovation and intellectual property rights.
New loans to both farmers and small and micro enterprises in Xinjiang in the first half of the year exceeded the annual increase in 2019, according to data from the Urumqi Central Sub-branch of the People's Bank of China.
In the first half of this year, the Urumqi Central Sub-branch of the People's Bank of China used a variety of monetary policy tools to guide the banking industry in continuously increasing the loan supply, providing sufficient capital guarantees for COVID-19 prevention and control and the resumption of work and production.
Free Nucleic Acid Testing Have Basically Been Completed in Most of Regions of Urumqi, Second Testing is Ongoing in High-risk Areas-Ecns.cn
URUMQI, July 26 (Ecns.cn, by Sun Tingwen, Zhao Yaomin): Zhang Wei, director of the Municipal Health Commission of Urumqi, reported on the state of the latest outbreak of pandemic and nucleic acid testing in Urumqi on the 26th, saying that at present, free nucleic acid testing work has been basically completed in most areas of Urumqi.
The expert group of the State Council and experts from the autonomous region and Urumqi are making further assessments of the development of the pandemic based on the results of the nucleic acid testing and epidemiological investigations.
The Press Office of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region held a press conference on the 26th to report on the pandemic situation and its prevention and control in Xinjiang.
According to him, there were 22 new confirmed COVID-19 cases in Urumqi from 0:00 to 24 on July 25 (including 5 confirmed asymptomatic cases), and 38 new asymptomatic cases.
As of 24:00 on July 25, 135 cases were confirmed in Urumqi and 147 were asymptomatic.
The newly-added asymptomatic cases on the 25th were also basically discovered through free nucleic acid testing in the city.
Zhang Wei, director of the Municipal Health Commission of Urumqi, reported that free nucleic acid testing work has basically been completed in most areas of Urumqi.
He also said that from the experience of other regions in China, there are many factors that affect the results of nucleic acid testing, such as sensitivity of detection reagents, infection time and detoxification time of the tested people, cooperation of the tested people when the samples are taken (low level of cooperation may lead to failure to take the specimen), as well as the detection environment and the proficiency of the inspectors.
For various reasons, false negative results can also appear in nucleic acid testing.
False negative means that the person tested is indeed infected, but the results of the nucleic acid test are negative.
In addition, for those who have close contact with confirmed cases and suspected cases, it usually takes two nucleic acid tests to exclude them.
For those who have been to the high-risk areas for the pandemic, if fever and respiratory symptoms occur, there may be a possibility of false negatives in nucleic acid testing, so another nucleic acid test is needed.
He said that in view of the above situation, for the health of the people of all ethnic groups in the city, Urumqi would carry out two free nucleic acid tests in key areas such as Tianshan district and Saybag district, and carry out the work of “making up for deficiencies".
It is reported that Tianshan district and Saybag district are high-risk epidemic areas.

Fauci, White House pandemic expert: cautiously optimistic attitude should be held towards vaccine development in early 2021
Fauci made the above remarks at an online video conference hosted by the International Leadership Foundation on July 25th.
He warned that it was not clear how COVID-19 would develop in the autumn and winter, nor what the ultimate impact of the pandemic would be, saying, "The only way to end all this is that we all choose to be part of the solution."
According to data from Johns Hopkins University, as of 21:00 on July 25th, the number of confirmed cases in the United States was 4.176 million, with 146,000 deaths.
Fauci said some parts of the United States were struggling with a pandemic resurgence.
Although the pandemic situation varies from place to place and needs to be dealt with according to local conditions, diversified anti-pandemic strategies do not mean that there is no close connection between them.
The pandemic situation in one area will eventually affect other areas.
"This is not the time for complacency," Fauci said, "We have not finished our work, so we must step up our efforts and be alert regarding the uncertainty of the future. ”
David Ho, a Chinese American medical expert and the founder of HAART (highly active antiretroviral therapy) for AIDs treatment, pointed out at the conference that COVID-19 in the US had not yet reached its peak.
"Each of us has to do our part to slow the spread of the virus. ”
David Ho called on the public to use their own practical actions to buy time for the research and development of COVID-19 treatment drugs and vaccines.
The International Leadership Foundation is a non-profit organization that promotes international exchange activities in the United States and the Asia-Pacific region, and is committed to promoting the status of Asian-Pacific Americans and cultivating international youth leaders.
Elaine Chao, US Department of Transportation Secretary, Grace Meng, a member of the House of Representatives, and Chiling Tong, founding president of the International Leadership Foundation, each spoke at the meeting.
They paid special tribute to the Asian-Pacific medical workers and volunteers who were fighting the pandemic on the front line, and called on the American public to continue to adhere to the pandemic prevention guidelines such as "social distancing" to curb the spread of the pandemic.

Brazilian Study Indicates Hydroxychloroquine Ineffective in Treating Mild and Moderate COVID-19 Illnesses-ChinaNews.com
Recently, a Brazilian study has shown that hydroxychloroquine is ineffective in treating COVID-19 patients with mild and moderate symptoms.
The study report was published in the New England Journal of Medicine.
Brazilian researchers put 667 patients from 55 hospitals across the country into 3 groups for clinical trials to compare the effectiveness of treatment using hydroxychloroquine only and through hydroxychloroquine combined with other antibiotics (azithromycin) to see if it was helpful in improving COVID-19 patients’ mild and moderate conditions.
The results show that not only is hydroxychloroquine not helpful, it can have damaging side effects on the body's organs.
This research was a collaboration between multiple prestigious Brazilian hospitals, such as Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, HCor, Hospital Sírio-Libanês, and BCRI, and BRICNet.
On the 25th (local time), Brazilian President Bolsonaro announced negative results of his forth NAAT test on social media.
While infected, Bolsonaro took hydroxychloroquine and actively recommended it on multiple occasions.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, reported July 25th (Correspondents: Yu Junjie and Chen Aiping) On the 25th, the correspondents learned from the Cyberspace Administration of China that the 2020 governance work over apps that illegally collect and use personal information recently began, and will focus on cracking down on serious problems reported by the public such as apps that surreptitiously upload private information in the background.
Sources state that this round of app governance work will be a joint action by four departments: the Cyberspace Administration of China, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, the Ministry of Public Security, and the State Administration for Market Regulation.
According to sources, the special governance work group made up of these four departments handled over 12,000 reports by netizens last year, inspected 2,300 apps, and for 260 especially problematic apps with large userbases, applied penalties such as public exposure, discussions, and removal from app markets.
As reported by the responsible party at the Cyberspace Administration of China, there are currently more than 5 million apps, and the problem of illegal collection of personal information has not been resolved at a fundamental level.
In 2020, governance work will be expanded beyond app verification to include SDK’s (software development kits), applets, and so on.
Sources further state that the working group will conduct dedicated research and in-depth inspection of topics such as the irregular collection and use of personal biometric information and the abuse of sensitive permissions by apps, and will focus on background permission abuses such as sound recording and photography.
Based on the circumstances surrounding problems discovered and the severity of their consequences, the working group will impose legal remedies such as discussions, warnings, removal from app markets, and fines, which will form an effective deterrent to such illegal behaviors.
Sources continue, stating that the working group plans to issue app market review and management instruction regarding app collection of personal information which will guide and encourage app markets to properly conduct pre-launch review of apps and strictly control listings.
The work group will also publish free technology tools to help small and medium-sized enterprises conduct self-assessment of their collection of personal information and improve legal compliance.

On July 25, the 2020 Hunan Red Tourism Culture Festival and the First Xiangtan Red Culture Industry Expo was held in Shaoshan.
In recent years, the demand for red tourism has gradually increased.
However, the development of the red tourism industry also faces the difficulties of lacking young participants, homogenization of tourism projects, and single commercial channels.
In particular, the outbreak of COVID-19 this year caused a serious setback in the national cultural and tourism industry, and red tourist attractions are also facing severe challenges.
For example, the use of UAV shooting, VR immersion, experience and other scientific and technological means can meet the tourist demand of "scenery in front of one’s eyes"; the introduction of live-streaming to promote famous and high-quality products of red scenic spots can directly improve the economic benefits of red tourism; the introduction of "cloud" technology can create high-quality displays with prominent themes, clear guidance, and rich connotations that fully display and enhance the publicity and education functions of red scenic spots; there have been innovations in the transmission modes of red culture, making revolutionary cultural relics "come to life" and making red tourism popular, thereby passing down the red gene and enhancing the attraction of red scenic spots.
The popular model of "county (district) head + special promotion of professional live-streamers" to promote red cultural and tourism products in the cultural festival was used, and application of 5G technology provided real-time viewing, smart city demonstrations, and other services to promote red cultural and tourism attractions; together, all of these are efforts to increase the intelligence level of red tourism, and it is expected that red tourism in Hunan will become increasingly popular.
Sino-US trade Negotiators Scheduled to Meet in August
According to a report from Hong Kong’s South China Morning Post on the 25th which cited an anonymous source, Chinese Vice Premier Liu He, who heads China's trade negotiation team, and US trade representative Lighthizer, who is co-leader of the US team, are expected to hold formal talks in August to review the implementation of the first phase of the bilateral trade agreement.
Although China has significantly increased its purchases of U.S. agricultural products over the past few months, it still falls short of the amounts pledged under the trade agreement because of factors such as COVID-19 epidemic, the report said.
Analysts said that the recent closure of each other's consulates by the United States and China, together with other disputes, could undermine any progress in the trade between the two sides.
The first phase of the trade agreement, which took effect a month after it was signed on Jan 15, stipulates that high-level trade framework groups from both sides should hold talks every six months.
The meeting will be "an important turning point" for both sides to assess the progress of the agreement, according to an insider.
But the person added that if the tense relations between the United States and China lead to low willingness to hold talks at this time, the two sides may agree that the May 8 conference call between Lighthizer and Liu He meets the trade agreement's requirement to meet every six months.
Relations between China and the United States have deteriorated sharply this year, with disputes over the origin of COVID-19, trade, Hong Kong, Xinjiang, the South China Sea, and ideology.
US President Donald Trump, who boasted about his achievements in the first phase of the deal at the start of the year, has recently changed his attitude.
Although China has been breaking the record for amounts of US corn and soybeans bought in a single day, "This trade deal doesn't mean as much to me now as it did when it was reached," he said at a White House press conference on 23th.
An anonymous Chinese government adviser also agreed that a new round of trade talks was unlikely because of the poor relations between the US and China and that "trade issues have lost weight in the Sino-US relationship."
However, he revealed that China's economic and trade agencies still held a meeting on the 23rd to discuss a series of issues, including how to increase imports from the United States, "We have tried our best to buy, so any additional purchases will be difficult."
Jacob Parker, vice president of the U.S.-China Business Council, said that it was "more important than ever" to maintain momentum on the first-phase agreement, and pointed out that China has made progress in further opening its financial market to US enterprises this year.
An analyst at the independent research company Plenum said that,"It's better to talk about it than not to talk about it, even though it may be treated as a routine matter. ”
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 26th, 2020 (Journalist: Wei Yukun) On July 26th, 2020, this journalist learned from the Ministry of Emergency Management that recently, the Office of State Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters and the Ministry of Emergency Management, together with the National Grain and Strategic Reserve Administration, made an emergency delivery of six kinds of centrally reserved materials to fight floods, including 1.35 million woven bags, woven cloth of 1.2 million square meters, and geotextiles of 130,000 square meters to Anhui Province in support of its emergency rescue efforts amidst a flooding disaster.
According to the relevant person in charge in the Ministry of Emergency Management, at present, in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River and the basin of the Huaihe River, the water level is high, the “No.3 Flood of Yangtze River in 2020” has formed in the upper reaches of Yangtze River on July 6th, and risks in some regions are increasing.
It is estimated by meteorological departments that in the next three days, there will be heavy downpours in Chongqing, Guizhou Province and in the middle and lower reaches of Yangtze River, so the flood control situation is still severe and complex.
According to their introduction, this flooding season, the Ministry of Emergency Management has deployed national comprehensive fire control and rescue teams to important regions as a preemptive rescue measure, and have participated in 10,364 flood rescues, dispatched over 130,000 officers, 17,778 fire fighting trucks and 11,887 boats, rescued 37,777 people, and evacuated over 107,000 trapped people in danger.
NASDAQ Chief Representative for China Region: Now is the best time for US IPO’s for Chinese companies - Economic Observer - Financial News Website
www.eeo.com.cn - Reporter - Zhang Bin - The US market has begun supervising China concept stocks more closely due to the Luckin Coffee fraud incident, and this, paired with long-term pressure on valuations, have increased the pressure faced by Chinese concept stocks in the American market, causing several companies such as NetEase and JD.com to begin the process of migrating their primary listing location to Hong Kong.
Meanwhile, companies such as Shell and Ideal Auto have recently expressed enthusiasm about listing in the US market.
Given the epidemic and the crisis for China concepts stocks, is now the best time for Chinese companies to hold IPO’s in the US?
“Several recent examples of IPO’s and the state of companies that plan to go public in the US soon show us that the basic nature of American IPO’s have not changed, in fact the current market is very good, likely the best time in the past decade for Chinese companies to stage IPO’s. “
These were the words of Hao Yusheng, NASDAQ Chief Representative for the China Region, at Xueqiu’s “2020 Listed Company Leadership Summit China Concepts Stock Forum”.
In April of this year, the American Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) and Public Company Accounting Regulatory Board (PCAOB) stated, "Emerging Market Investments Entail Significant Disclosure, Financial Reporting and Other Risks; Remedies are Limited" listing certain risks that the disclosures by Chinese companies may be "incomplete or misleading."
According to the statement, despite the significant uptick in international cooperation in recent years, US regulators still have difficulty accessing information, and the SEC and PCAOB also face challenges on a legal and practical level; in addition to the statement, a detailed list of companies on the stock exchange which pose obstacles in their audits and their auditing agencies was posted on the PCAOB website, which included many Chinese concepts stock companies.
Beyond this, in May of this year, the US Senate passed the "Foreign Companies Accountability Act", which adds extra disclosure requirements for companies listed in the US.
Hao Yusheng believes the crisis for Chinese concepts stocks has not impacted the appetites of investors.
“Everyone panicked when the news first emerged, and wondered if they could list in the US in the future, but we soon discovered that this was not a problem for investors; investors will certainly encounter these new problems as they plan for their IPO’s, and these may even become standardized requirements, but these are not important factors for investors when they decide whether to invest in Chinese companies.
Everyone should try to remain calm about the current situation.
This may seem to be the most serious development in the last two years, but in terms of investor appetite, it hasn’t had any impact.
So, from now to the end of the year, or until the US presidential election, the surge in US IPO’s will continue. “
On May 9th, Kingsoft Cloud was officially listed on the NASDAQ in the US, making it the first Chinese company to stage its IPO in the US after the epidemic.
“The listing of Kingsoft Cloud should give Chinese companies getting ready for an IPO a lot of confidence, “
Hao Yusheng said.
Based on Xueqiu’s 2020 China Stocks Data Report, in the first half of the year, 20 Chinese companies had IPO’s in the US, a year-on-year increase of 17.6%; these 20 companies raised 2.725 billion yuan in initial funding, which was a rebound over last year, with a year-on-year increase of 52.4%; and industry distribution changed as well, with healthcare industry IPO’s especially prominent in the first half of the year, showing a year-on-year increase of 100%.
Hao Yusheng said it was primarily high-quality Chinese companies that sought IPO’s in the first half of the year, and that such high-quality companies with strong fundamentals and potential for growth are likely to become investor favorites.
Hao Yusheng continues to be optimistic about US IPO’s for Chinese companies, whether in the short, medium, or long term.
“In the short term, the surge of companies holding IPO’s in the US will continue; in the medium term, Chinese companies have more options with A-shares, Hong Kong stocks, and U.S. stocks, and factors such as the US election and China-US relations will be considerations for market and timing choices; in the long term, things should return to normal, with cyclical market fluctuations, both political and economic, ultimately returning to a normal state, because the markets have always fluctuated. “
At the same time, Hao Yusheng said, “There have been many factors of instability this year, but for the best companies, whatever market conditions may be, having a solid business and showing investors growth is more important than any other factors, so investors should choose high-quality Chinese companies. “

Commentator of the People's Daily: Focus on Running Our Own Affairs and Create New Advantages for the Future Development -- On Learning and Implementing General Secretary Xi Jinping's Important Speech at the Entrepreneur Forum -- XinhuaNet
Beijing, July 25 (Xinhua) - People's Daily, July 26, Article of Commentator: Focus on Running Our Own Affairs and Create New Advantages for the Future Development
At present, the global epidemic and the world economic situation are still serious and complex, and China faces unprecedented challenges in its development.
Maintaining strategic determination, strengthening our confidence to succeed, and concentrating on our own affairs are the keys for us to cope with all kinds of risks and challenges.
At the recent Entrepreneur Forum, General Secretary Xi Jinping stressed that in the face of an external environment characterized by rising protectionism, global economic downturn, and a shrinking international market, we need to pool resources and concentrate on managing the country's affairs well, and give full play to the advantage of a huge domestic market, so that a new pattern of development will gradually take shape, with domestic circulation playing a dominant role and domestic and international circulations reinforcing each other, and as such, efforts should be made to elevate the modernization level of the industrial and supply chains, promote sci-tech innovation, speed up breakthroughs in core technologies, and foster new advantages for future development.
Those who observe the trends are wise, and those who follow the trends win.
In the external environment of the in-depth development of the economic globalization, putting both ends of market and resources on the world market have played an important role in China's rapid development.
At present, the world under the impact of COVID-19 is undergoing profound changes, facing more unstable and uncertain factors, and economic globalization has encountered headwinds and undertows.
One of the most important aspects of making ideological and working preparations to cope with the changes in the external environment for a long time and promoting China's economy to ride the wind and waves and achieve steady development is to take expanding and meeting domestic demand as the strategic basis for development, give full play to its own advantages, and add impetus to China's economic development and drive the global economic recovery by allowing the domestic economy to prosper and unblocking domestic circulation.
We must be fully aware that building a complete system of domestic demand is vital to China's long-term development and stability.
The CPC Central Committee assessed the situation and made it clear that it was necessary to resolutely implement the strategy of expanding domestic demand in response to the impact of COVID-19, thereby maintaining the long-term, sustained, and healthy development of China's economy, and consistently meeting people's increasing demand for a better life.
The advantage of a large economy is internal circulation.
China has the world’s most complete and largest industrial system, strong production capacity, and complete supporting capabilities; it has more than 100 million market entities and more than 170 million talents with higher education or professional skills; besides, the huge domestic demand market formed by 1.4 billion people, including more than 400 million middle-income consumers, is in the fast development stage of new industrialization, informatization, urbanization and agricultural modernization, so the potential for investment demand is huge.
The basic economic systems, such as public ownership playing a leading role and all forms of ownership growing side by side, distribution according to labor as the main body with a variety of distribution methods coexisting, and the socialist market economy system can not only stimulate the vitality of all kinds of market entities and unleash and develop social productive forces, but also promote the organic integration of efficiency and equity, and constantly realize common prosperity.
We should firmly grasp the strategic focus of expanding domestic demand, make production, distribution and circulation more dependent on the domestic market to achieve a virtuous circle, define the strategic direction of supply-side structural reform, and achieve dynamic balance between aggregate supply and aggregate demand at a higher level.
We should speed up the construction of a complete system of domestic demand, vigorously promote innovation in science, technology and other fields, and accelerate the development of strategic emerging industries such as the digital economy, intelligent manufacturing, life and health, and new materials to form more new areas and poles of growth, so that a new development pattern will gradually emerge whereby domestic circulation plays a dominant role and domestic and international circulations reinforce each other.
Opening up brings progress, while isolation is bound to leave one behind.
General Secretary Xi Jinping has stressed on many occasions that China will not close its door and will only open wider to the outside world.
With the domestic market as the mainstay, we are by no means operating behind closed doors; rather, we will leverage the potential of domestic demand to better connect the domestic and international markets, and make better use of both domestic and international markets and resources to achieve stronger and more sustainable development.
Meanwhile, expanding domestic demand and opening up are not in conflict with each other, because the smoother the domestic circulation, the more conducive it will be to building a new pattern of opening up and creating new advantages for participating in international cooperation and competition.
Despite the rising trend of protectionism in the world, we must stay on the right side of history, deepen reform and opening-up, strengthen openness and cooperation in science and technology, promote an open world economy, and build a community with a shared future for mankind.
The Chinese nation has experienced many tribulations in its history, but it has never been overwhelmed; instead, its frustrations only give it the courage to grow stronger and rise up from its troubles.
On the way forward, China has the strong leadership of the Central Committee of the CPC, with Comrade Xi Jinping as its core, has the remarkable advantage of the socialist system with Chinese characteristics, has powerful mobilization capabilities and powerful overall strength, and has the unity and struggle of the whole party, the whole army and the people of all ethnic groups, meaning we can surely overcome all difficulties and obstacles, maintain the momentum of good economic and social development, build a well-off society in an all-round way, and successfully embark on a new journey to fully build a modern socialist country!
Yu'E Bao's Revenue Declines, but the "Post-90s" Put Money into it in “Retaliation”?
As Yu'E Bao's revenue declines, the "post-90s" generation has not given up using Yu'E Bao, but has instead begun to put money into it like crazy.
The "Yu'E Bao Savings Report of the Post-90s Generation" (2020 Edition) released by the China New Economic Research Institute with Alipay recently showed that in the first half of the year, the post-90s generation was more interested in saving money: the amount of savings per capita increased by nearly 40% over 2019.
Interestingly, the post-90s generation is more likely to start saving money with small sums, with 60% of them saving less than RMB 20 every time on average...
Putting money into Yu'E Bao has also become a habit of the post-90s generation.
Statistics show that 134 million of the 700 million Yu'E Bao users were born in the 1990s.
China has 174 million people born in the 1990s, which means that about three out of every four of the post-90s generation in the country are saving money with Yu'E Bao.
At present, the 7-day annualized yield of Yu'E Bao and other monetary funds has fallen to about 1.5% from higher than 2% at the beginning of the year.
Even so, this has not affected the pace of the post-90s generation saving money.
In the context of the increased "saving effect" of Yu'E Bao, many young people who are accustomed to Yu'E Bao have directly become "fund holders".
According to the data from Alipay, the number of new "fund holders" on Alipay has more than doubled in the past month as of July 13, with more and more young people achieving "advanced" financial management on Alipay.
Some analysts believe that funds flowing into the stock market from Yu'E Bao is also an important reason for the clear decline in the share of monetary funds in June.
The report also shows that post-90s generation women are more likely to save more money than men, with the average amount of money saved by women being 20% higher than that of men, and among Alipay's fund holders, 60% are men, while women tend to choose more stable financial methods compared with men.
After saving their money, what are the plans of the post-90s generation?
According to Alipay, the post-90s generation has a habit of saving money for goals, and travel is the most popular goal for saving money.
Affected by the COVID-19, many in the post-90s generation have saved money to prepare for their post-epidemic travel; the resumption of cinema business also offers a new way to shift from saving to spending.

Marvin Gatpayat, PCOO Deputy Secretary of Executive and Legal Affairs, said the office is in the new office building at the Office of the President, and it was supposed to resume work on 27th, the day when President Duterte is to release his fifth State of the Union.
On that day, Martin Andanar assured the public that the PCOO would continue to fulfill its responsibilities to the people of the Philippines, make sure to provide important information to the public in a timely manner while enhancing contact tracing and testing to avoid further COVID-19 transmission among PCOO staff members, and he stated that he prays for speedy recovery of the members who tested positive.

France Increases Its Military Spending in Space -- Xinhua Net
Florence Parly, Defense Minister of France, said on July 24 that France would invest further billions of euros into space defense to develop space military strength as a means to guard against other countries’ possible “unfriendly behavior” in the outer space.
Parly told La Provence that day that from 2019 to 2025, France’s budget for space military projects would increase to EUR 4.3 billion (USD 5 billion) from the previous EUR 3.6 billion (about USD 4.2 billion).
According to the France Military Budget Plan 2019-2025, approved in 2018 by the French Assembly, France is projected to update its existing observation satellites and communication satellites and launch three electromagnetic interception satellites to enhance the modernization level of its space monitoring radar.
Emmanuel Macron, President of France, announced in July last year that the French air force would establish a space military command post and “aviation and space armies” within itself.
Parly said that she would officially announce the establishment of the space army while inspecting a military college in Saron, Provence.
Parly said that the space army fell under the air force and by 2025, its authorized strength would reach 500.
She said “People previously perceived space as a place to serve for the common interests of science, but they don’t think that anymore. Space is a place where all major powers compete for global hegemony. ”
Parly reiterated Macron’s previous announcement, saying that France was not interested in arms race.
“We are not starting an arms race at all. But I am responsible for thoroughly acknowledging the possible threats we face. ”
Parly re-stated that the military satellite jointly used by France and Italy was spied on in 2017.
She said that the “secret watcher” was a Russian satellite.
Russia denied this.
Parly said that France would “soon” have small patrol satellites able to detect and identify the “bad actors behind unfriendly behavior”.
French media holds the view that France’s efforts to establish its space military was caused by Donald Trump’s requirement for U.S. Department of Defense to draft bills to build a space force in February of last year.
Trump signed the National Defense Authorization Bill in December last year, approving the establishment of the sixth armed services branch in the United States, the Space Force.
Some experts feared that the measures taken by the United States would accelerate the militarization of its space endeavors, which might arouse a new arms race in space.

XIAMEN, July 26 (Ecns.cn, by Yang Fushan, Zhang Shushan, Xu Jingyi) Vascular Surgery Department in Changhai Hospital in Shanghai affiliated to the Second Military Medical University, as a famous vascular surgery center in China, signed a contract with the Vascular Surgery Department of Zhongshan Hospital Affiliated to Xiamen University on July 25 to set up a cooperation center, which will promote exchanges and cooperation in the field of vascular surgery, especially in aortic emergencies and severe cases.
Zhongshan Hospital Affiliated to Xiamen University said that after the vascular surgery department of the two hospitals formally establish the collaborative relationship, they will carry out remote consultation to work out real-time treatment plans with Changhai Hospital, staff will be sent for training and participating in weekly surgical technology exchanges and teaching visits organized by two hospitals; for complex cases, Changhai experts can be invited to perform surgery at the hospital according to patients' needs, allowing patients in southwest Fujian to enjoy the top medical resources in China without leaving the province.
The two hospitals will also work together to carry out innovative scientific research on surgery, popularization of aortic disease, early screening, and so on.
A special seminar on the aorta, organized by the Beijing Health Promotion Association and hosted by the Zhongshan Hospital Affiliated to Xiamen University, was held in Xiamen on the same day.
The two famous hospitals in Shanghai and Xiamen held a signing ceremony for the cooperation center for vascular surgery at the same time, announcing the formation of the collaborative partnership to jointly improve the treatment of vascular surgery-related diseases in southwest Fujian.
The Vascular Surgery Department in Changhai Hospital of Shanghai is the only vascular surgery institute in the army and the only clinical medical center for vascular diseases in Shanghai, so as the first national key institute in the discipline of vascular surgery, the hospital has taken the lead in setting up the Chinese Medical Doctor Association's Specialist Committee on Endovascology, which is a leading and experienced team in this field.
Professor Huang Xiaojin, Director of the Vascular Surgery Department in Zhongshan Hospital Affiliated to Xiamen University, was interviewed by the media.
The Vascular Surgery Department in Zhongshan Hospital Affiliated to Xiamen University is the first vascular surgery department set up as an independent discipline in Fujian Province; it has long been dedicated to the diagnosis and treatment of aortic and peripheral vascular diseases, and was approved as a provincial clinical key specialty in 2018.
In the treatment of aortic diseases, the hospital has vast experience in not only treating dissecting aneurysms and aortic aneurysms, but also the rupture of aortic aneurysms.
"Viewed from the diversity, difficulty, complication and other aspects of surgery, the vascular surgery department of Zhongshan Hospital Affiliated to Xiamen University is outstanding in the region where it is located, which is why this cooperation center has been created to carry out all-round and in-depth cooperation in medicine, teaching and research in the diagnosis and treatment of lower extremity arteries, carotid arteries and other diseases not limited to the aorta, ”
said Professor Feng Rui, Deputy Director of Vascular Surgery Department at Changhai Hospital.
In 2018, the Zhongshan Hospital Affiliated to Xiamen University and Changhai Hospital signed a contract to establish the "Li Zhaoshen Famous Doctor Studio" in the Gastroenterology Department.
Professor Huang Xiaojin, Director of Vascular Surgery Department, said in an interview with Ecns.cn that the hospital's vascular surgery department already has a long-term relationship with Changhai Hospital, and the formal collaborative relationship between the two hospitals can bring their cooperation and exchange to a deeper level.
He said that the hospital would regularly invite Shanghai experts to Xiamen to carry out surgical exchanges, teaching ward rounds, and discussions on difficult cases, weekly remote consultations are planned, and the department will also send staff for further training and exchanges to strengthen team cultivation and development.
The reporter learned at the seminar that vascular disease is the number one cause of death in China, and the aorta plays an important role as the main artery for all organs and the heart.
Aortic disease is often associated with high risks, high mortality, and complicated treatment; the thickest section of the aorta is 4cm in diameter, and once an aneurysm appears, followed by a rupture or intima rupture and dissecting aneurysm, it can lead to hemorrhage, which is very dangerous.
In recent years, as people's lifestyles change and the pace of life speeds up, China has become the leading country around the world for hypertension, and aortic disease cases has increased, so along with the development of surgical techniques and industrial materials, the treatment of aortic disease continues to be minimally invasive, rapid, and efficient.
Doctors can "reroute" the blood flow by puncturing the thigh and placing a stent in the aorta to avoid impact on the aneurysm or ruptured dissection and to achieve good results, and some cases can even be done with local anesthesia.
More than ten domestic experts were invited to the seminar to discuss new advances in the treatment of aortic disease, with cutting-edge technology training and discussion of difficult cases in the form of salons.
This reporter learned at the seminar that along with the development of surgical techniques and industrial materials, the treatment of aortic disease continues to be minimally invasive, rapid, and efficient.

Prevention work must also be carried out in the Southwest and North China regions where heavy rains are expected.
The Ministry of Water Resources has decided to maintain the L2 emergency flood and drought prevention measures.
At the request of the Jiangxi province and national flood and drought prevention and control departments and the Ministry of Emergency Management, 20 high-volume flood drainage vehicles were dispatched by firefighting and rescue corps in Shandong, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang and the Fujian Longyan Qiaolong Emergency Equipment Company to help alleviate serious disasters in Jiangxi such as urban waterlogging and farmland flooding that result from such heavy rains.

Chinanews.com, Chongqing, posted July 26th (correspondent Han Lu) On July 26th, this reporter learned from China Railway Chengdu Bureau Group LTD that the Zhengzhou–Wanzhou high-speed railway’s Small Three Gorges Tunnel, with a total length of roughly 18.9 km, had been completed the same day.
Based on available information, the Small Three Gorges Tunnel is both the longest high-speed rail tunnel in the Three Gorges Reservoir area, and also, among the rail projects under construction in China, is the longest dual-track single-hole high-speed rail tunnel with a 350 km/h design speed.
The Zhengzhou-Wanzhou high-speed railway links cities within the three provinces of Henan, Hubei, and Chongqing, connects to the Beijing-Guangzhou and Xuzhou-Lanzhou high-speed rail routes via the Zhengzhou North Station and reaches Chongqing through the Chongqing-Wanzhou intercity railway link via the Wanzhou South Station; it is an important component of China’s "Eight Vertical and Eight Horizontal" network that connects to the Yangtze River corridor and the Hohhot–Nanning corridor.
The Zhengzhou-Wanzhou high-speed railway Small Three Gorges Tunnel was fully connected on the 26th.

The Zhengzhou-Wanzhou high-speed railway begins in Zhengzhou City, Henan Province, then runs southwest through Pingdingshan City, Nanyang City, and Xiangyang City in Hubei Province, and terminates in Wanzhou District, Chongqing City; the length of the new line is about 818 km, of which 184 km run through the borders of Chongqing, and has a design speed of 350 km/h.
The Zhengzhou-Xiangyang stage of the line opened early on December 1st, 2019, and construction on the Chongqing stage is being accelerated.
The Small Three Gorges Tunnel, which was fully connected on the 26th, is a total-line control project for the Zhengzhou-Wanzhou high-speed railway; the project is located at the border of Fengjie County and Wushan County, Chongqing City, has a total length of roughly 18.9 km, and has a maximum buried depth of 890 meters.
Work began on the tunnel in February of 2017, and the tunnel was fully connected on July 26th, 2020.
Wang Guojun, director of tunnel design for the Zhengzhou-Wanzhou high-speed railway at China Railway Eryuan Engineering Group Co., Ltd., stated that the Small Three Gorges Tunnel cuts through highly complicated terrain and geological conditions, and faces risks such as karsts, sudden mudslides, and massive soft rock deformation, making it a Class I high-risk tunnel, for which design and construction are exceedingly difficult.
“During construction, we used approaches such as geological surveys, geophysical techniques, and advanced drilling methods to make geological forecasts far in advance and create special design plans for over 30 types of caves. For example, we built a bridge within the tunnel that was 24 meters in length across a karst cave gap that was 10 meters wide and 55 meters deep to avoid tunnel settlement,” he said.
The building company, the China Railway Tunnel Group, constructed the tunnel using a combination of dredging and blocking, building horizontal tunnels, water blocking, enhanced structural tunnel support, and building outflow treatment plants, which together ensured the project could proceed on schedule while avoiding damage from polluted wastewater to the Three Gorges Scenic Area, and at the same time, overcame construction problems such as 7 kilometers of karst soft rock deformation and other bad geology, as well as a maximum daily water inflow of 157,000 cubic meters.
When the Zhengzhou-Wanzhou high-speed railway is completed and fully operational, it will have critical importance as a rapid and convenient passenger channel that connects the regions of Southwest China, the Central Plains, North China, and Northeast China which improves both the quality and capacity of the Southwest China railway network’s northeast corridor, improves the regional transit network, speeds up the development of tourism resources and urbanization along the route, promotes inter-regional coordinated development, and facilitates the implementation of the Western Region development strategy.
Collecting immigration status data through US Census for House of Representatives seat allocation is unconstitutional, say experts
Civil rights groups and several US cities and counties have filed a lawsuit against the US federal government, claiming the Trump administration’s attempts to exclude undocumented immigrants from the US Census are both unconstitutional and would unworkable.
The US Census decides the allocation of seats in the US House of Representatives.
American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) executive director Sarah Brannon told VOA, “This is unworkable. “
She continued, saying Trump’s demand that the US Census determine the immigration status of census respondents was difficult and “not very reliable”. “
Common Cause, another civil rights organization, filed a lawsuit on Thursday to challenge Trump’s executive order.
Several New Jersey and Georgia cities joined the lawsuit.
On Friday, Virginia’s Arlington County also joined the lawsuit.
Arlington County Board Chair Libby Garvey said, “The US Constitution requires that we make an accurate count of our population every 10 years. We need an accurate count of every resident in Arlington County, and we must never illegal attempts like these to frighten away and shrink our immigrant community succeed. “
Other individuals and organizations expressed praise for Trump’s executive order.
Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall called the executive order a “victory” for the state.
He said, “The allocation of House of Representatives and electoral college seats must be based on the number of residents in each state, particularly the number of legal residents. “
Last year, the US Supreme Court stopped the Trump administration’s attempts to include citizenship questions on the 2020 census form.
Earlier this week President Trump signed an executive order directing Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross, who oversees the US Census Bureau, to submit data on the undocumented population obtained from the census, so that the administration can exclude this population from state census results, which in turn are used to determine whether each state will increase, decrease, or maintain its number of seats in the House of Representatives.
Seats in the US House of Representatives are reallocated every 10 years based on changes in population.

Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, reported July 26th (correspondents: Ke Gaoyang, Li Song) Our reporters have learned from Chongqing Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters that during a new round of heavy rains in Chongqing on July 25th, 33 districts and counties experienced heavy rainstorms, and water levels in 4 small and medium-size rivers rose above flood alert levels, causing local Level IV flood control emergency measures to be initiated.
According to reports from the Chongqing Municipal Hydrological Monitoring Station, between 8:00 on the 25th to 8:00 on the 26th, most areas of Chongqing experienced heavy rain, with heavy rainstorms appearing in 33 districts and counties including Jiangjin, Qijiang, and Wulong, and very heavy rainstorms appearing across 16 districts and counties including Wanzhou, Yunyang, and Nanchuan.
The highest daily rainfall of 197.5 mm occurred in Longshan Village, Jinshan Town, Nanchuan.
The heavy rain caused four small and medium-sized rivers; Lvzi River in Jiangjin District, Youjiang River in Fuling District, Yingyang River in Kaizhou District, and Tuantan River in Yunyang County; saw waters rise above flood alert levels, and at present, water levels are still rising.
The rain also led to landslides in Liujing Village, Didi Township, and Wulong District, which blocked traffic on village roads, and caused blockage of the Cang River along the Wujiang River, resulting in the river water forming a temporary lake, at which point an emergency evacuation was organized for local residents.
The Chongqing Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters responded to this torrential rain by issuing a Level III emergency river flood warning at 13:00 on the 26th and initiating Level IV flood control emergency measures, as well as instructing the affected counties and regions to conduct more frequent inspections and be on high alert, in case emergency rescue teams and materials needed to be urgently mobilized and people in affected areas required evacuation.
Acting in response to trends and advancing the construction of industrial projects-Shidian Net-Hunan Daily-www.voc.com.cn
Hunan in midsummer is steaming hot.
The enthusiasm unleased by the on-the-spot observation meeting for promoting the construction of industrial projects in the whole province surpassed even the heat summer heat, and the distinct guidance of "comparing strength with industry and defining heroes with projects" inspired industry in Hunan.
The development of Hunan should rely on constructing projects and fostering industries.
Faced with the unusual first half of the year, under the firm leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, the whole province united as one and made every effort to fight the tough battles against COVID-19 pandemic prevention and flood control, and adopted industrial projects as the "pioneer" in the implementation of "ensuring stability in employment, financial operations, foreign trade, foreign investment, domestic investment, and expectations" and "ensuring security in job, basic living needs, operations of market entities, food and energy security, stable industrial and supply chains, and the normal functioning of primary-level governments".
From a year-on-year decline of 1.9% in the first quarter to a year-on-year growth of 1.3% in the first half of the year, it is hard to imagine how many difficulties we have overcome and how much effort we have expended during this period.
In this precious report, the construction of industrial projects is the key support for Hunan to speed up the recovery of the economy and stable development.
The trend is irreversible.
The construction of industrial projects should be put into the overall situation, and not only should we be good at accumulating and seeking potential, but also we should be good at recognizing, seeking, and acting according to changes.
Under the complex and severe background of the current international situation, in addition to painstaking efforts to attract investment, we need to concentrate on researching the new characteristics of the current new situation, grasp the rules more scientifically and be more scientific and accurate, and better integrate into the new development paradigm featuring dual circulation, in which domestic and overseas markets reinforce each other, with the domestic market as the mainstay.
We have paid more attention to improving the basic capabilities of industry.
In the first half of the year, not only did a large number of heavyweight investment projects in emerging industries start and sow hopes in our province, but also enterprises in traditional industries have accelerated their deployment in digital, intelligent, and green industrial transformation.
Transformations have been made in the existing production line of the project of Yiyang Aoshikang No.3 Science Park, and the intelligent production line of high-end printed circuit board has taken the lead; the new factory of the Changde Cigarette Factory of China Tobacco Hunan Industrial Corporation was committed to the process of intelligent transformation and the construction of modern factories, which was also a vivid portrayal of "old trees sprouting new buds"; focusing on the national major strategy and "new infrastructure and new urbanization initiatives and major projects", we have focused on consolidating and upgrading advantageous industries, actively cultivated and developed emerging industries, and comprehensively increased the strength of scientific and technological innovation and localization substitution to continuously consolidate basic conditions and accumulate transformation momentum.
We have paid more attention to cultivating and developing new industries, new business forms, and new models.
The unexpected COVID-19 outbreak brought about the popularity of the "cloud economy", stimulated the potential of the digital economy, and provided new opportunities for industrial transformation; in the first half of the year, the computer and office equipment manufacturing, electronic and communication equipment manufacturing industry of our province grew by 12.6%, and the online retail sales of wholesale and retail enterprises above a designated size increased by 32.2% over the same period last year, and the income of online meals from catering enterprises increased by 35.6% over the same period last year.
We have created new opportunities out of crises and opened up new prospects in changing circumstances; we have actively promoted digital industrialization and industrial digitization, and guided the integrated development of the digital economy and real economy.
We have paid more attention to optimizing and stabilizing the industrial chain and the supply chain.
Construction machinery is the main force of industry in Hunan, but two thirds of the supporting enterprises are outside the province, so there is still space and potential in the supporting chain.
To strengthen industrial chain thinking and better grasp the project, we need to continuously accumulate experience from leading enterprises and achieve technological breakthroughs in the key links of the industrial chain; we should also cultivate all localities with great concentration, stimulate the "chain" reaction by strengthening the chain, supplementing the chain, and extending the chain, promote the collaborative layout of relevant supporting industries, and speed up the construction of an independent, controllable, safe, and reliable industrial chain and supply chain.
We are overcoming hardship together and supporting our enterprises; Hunan is still a land of enthusiasm and happiness with a good business environment and emerging business opportunities.
All parts of the province have frequently employed new and practical methods, believing that the "burden reduction" of enterprises promotes the "acceleration" of high-quality development; "shareholder type" services have been implemented in Shaoyang to guarantee the high efficiency of enterprises; in the process of recovering the losses caused by the epidemic, there were many vivid stories about finding weak links and pain points, and turning risks into opportunities.
Focusing on the research, cultivation, and development of industries, and solidly optimizing the business environment will surely win the favor of more investors.
Difficulties ahead remain, but the state of overcoming difficulties has become the normal state for the whole province to focus on the construction of industrial projects and promote high-quality development.
During this critical period, we must learn and carry out the important instructions and spirit of general secretary Xi Jinping, and respond to external uncertainties effectively with the certainty of our work; we must persevere in promoting industrial projects and uniting as one with enthusiasm to ensure that the "13th Five-Year Plan" and the goal of building a moderately prosperous society in all respects will be accomplished successfully.

Overall Stable Employment and Price Indicate “Temperature” of Economy-ChineNews.com

Overall Stable Employment and Price Indicate “Temperature” of Economy
Reported by Economic Daily·ce.cn correspondent Lin Huocan
Facing the impact of COVID-19 in the first half of this year, China carried forward pandemic prevention and control as well as economic and social development in a coordinated manner; pandemic prevention and control continues to improve, while the economy is obviously recovering, and with employment and commodity prices, which are closely related to people’s well-being, in a generally stable state, China’s economy is presenting an economic performance card with “normal temperature”.
In the first two months of this year, the surveyed unemployment rate increased.
Especially in February, the production and operation of many companies were basically shutdown, and with demand for labor decreased and recruitment postponed or cancelled, the urban unemployment rate increased as a result.
As the outbreak prevention and control outcomes took a turn for the better, the order of production and living standards across the society is recovering.
The Party Central Committee adheres to the key idea of seeking improvements in stability to further enhance the hedging strength of macro policies, reinforce pro-employment policies in all dimensions, and to actively facilitate efforts in assisting companies to maintain staffing stability and expand employment.
China is reinforcing policies to offset the impact and maintain employment with a portfolio of “reduce, exempt, defer, return and subsidy” policies: reducing and exempting 3 types of social insurance for companies in a phased manner, allowing deferred payments of social insurance fees, increasing beneficiary ranges for returning unemployment insurance to medium, small, and micro enterprises to maintain work posts and for work-based training policies, and providing subsidies for companies employing key population groups.
As employment stabilization policies were implemented, companies demands for labor gradually recovered, and as employment improves, the urban unemployment rate has decreases; in June, the unemployment rate was 5.7%.
According to Zhang Yi, Director of the Population and Employment Statistics Division of National Bureau of Statistics, all employment policies continued to be effective in the second quarter; labor that retreated earlier due to the outbreak is returning gradually, and in June, the urban labor participation rate increased around 10 points compared to February, close to that of the same period last year.
As data shows, the total urban employment in June increased 19% compared to February, with many industries bouncing back to pre-pandemic levels; average weekly working hours of company employees reached 46.8 hours, 6.6 hours higher than in February, and 0.1 hours higher than in January.
Commodity prices are also relevant for families.
In January, CPI increased 5.4% year on year, a record high in many years.
In February, year-on-year CPI dropped slighted, but was still above 5%.
High level year-on-year CPI growth was driven by consumer demand before Spring Festival, but even with Spring Festival demand, it fell by month and was lower on a year-on-year base.
However, COVID-19 had an obvious impact on commodity prices.
Affected by pandemic prevention and control, delays in logistics and supplies, increases in transportation costs occurred across the country in January and February; also, as some people rushed to hoard, the prices of some daily necessities went up.
In response to disturbances in commodity prices from pandemic prevention and control, the relevant authorities put major daily supplies in emergency circulation to ensure unblocked supply.
Through a series of policies and measures, the market supply of vegetables and fruit was secured.
In response to the sharp rise in pork price at the beginning of the year, the central government rolled out policies to maintain prices and supply, and regions and departments swiftly implemented them accordingly; as a result, the pork reserve supply obviously improved, capacity in pigs for slaughter was restored in an orderly manner, and order in production and sales gradually returned to normal.
Since March, pork prices have been dropping continuously, leading food prices to fall back to a 10.6% year-on-year increase in May; in June, affected by slowed output of pigs for slaughter, reduced imports, and recovered group consumption, pork prices saw slight month-on-month growth.
Seasonal changes in fresh vegetable prices were clear, with an average of 3.4% growth in the first half.
Due to a high year-on-year starting point last year, fresh fruit saw continuous drop in year-on-year prices, with an average 13.3% drop in the first half.
With people’s essential everyday needs effectively secured, the overall economic and social order was kept stable.
As transportation and logistics gradually returned to normal, regions reinforced supply guarantee measures, and market demand and supply took a turn for the better.
Since March, month-on-month CPI dropped for 4 consecutive months, year-on-year growth fell back to 2.5% in June from 4.3% in March, and overall commodity prices have stabilized.
In the next half of the year, commodity prices in the country will continue to maintain at a moderate level, with no significant inflation pressure overall, however, we still need to facilitate restoring the order of production and living with the premise of regular outbreak prevention and control.
Natural disasters like flood and drought in major agricultural production regions of crops, vegetables, and fruit must be dealt with efficiently, market supervision and regulation must be reinforced to sternly crack down regrading and price-gouging behaviors that disturb market order.

Explosive allegation in new book: Prince Harry thinks his older brother is “snobbish and arrogant”
UK newspapers The Times and The Sunday Times are serializing a new book called “Finding Freedom”, which describes the royal life and experiences of Prince Harry and his wife Meghan Markle.
However, according to a report from Reuters, Harry and Meghan have disassociated themselves from the book, claiming that they refused to be interviewed by the author and did not provide any content for it.
The Sunday Times reports that the new book quotes sources who claim that before their marriage, when Meghan and Harry were dating, Prince William wanted to confirm that Meghan, at the time a Hollywood actress, had no ulterior motives in marrying Harry.
One of the sources described William saying to Harry at the time, “Don’t let yourself be rushed (into marrying Meghan).
Take as much time as you can to get to know this girl. “
The report states that when Harry heard William describe Meghan as “this girl”, he thought his brother’s words were arrogant and snobbish, and that he felt he no longer needed to consider the opinions of others in the matter.
In January of this year, Harry and Meghan announced their plans to live a more independent life and support themselves economically.
In March, the couple formally renounced their status as high-ranking members of the royal family, and at present they live in Los Angeles with their son Archie, where they are pursuing new careers.
Harry and Meghan were married in May of 2018.
At the time, the marriage was seen as a way to bring Hollywood glamor and new energy into the British royal family, making the pair one of the world’s most prominent and scrutinized celebrity couples.

In recent years, some medical institutions name themselves in a nonstandard and inappropriate manner, or use the names of famed medical institutions without authorization according to the law, delivering misinformation to people when they seek medical treatment.
After checking the National Enterprise Credit Information Publicity System, some registered medical institutions in Heilongjiang Province have the same Chinese words in their names as Peking Union Medical College Hospital (“Xie He”) and other well-known medical institutions, which carry out business under this disguise, disrupting the normal medical order and causing a devastating social impact.
At the same time, Heilongjiang will use this as an opportunity to raise awareness of responsibility among market entities through various publicity activities, focusing on the consciousness of rights safeguarding according to law and the awareness of law-abiding operations.

chinanews.com, South Qinghai Lake, reported July 26th, headline: Qinghai Lake “Sea of Flowers Livecast Studio”: “Sweetness“ increases farmer income
Writers: Hu Guilong, Pan Yujie
“At Qinghai Lake in midsummer, there are golden flowers as far as the eye can see, and innumerable bees flying everywhere; the high elevation is high, large temperature difference between night and day, low air pollution, and strong illumination breeds the most resilient and fertile bee colonies which create the highly active, protein-rich, and nutritious Qinghai royal jelly, which is also low in sugar and fat, “
said Zhang Jianxun, assistant director of the Industry and Information Administration of Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in Qinghai Province.
The same day, the “Fighting the Epidemic Together Spring Royal Jelly Farmer Assistance” livecast sales event was held at Qinghai Lake, at which company representatives from the Chinese Bee Products Association, beekeepers, and many others came together to promote Qinghai’s bee products, selling nearly 10,000 bottles of Qinghai Plateau royal jelly for a value of almost 3.8 million yuan.

According to reports, this livecast sales event helped the Beijing Houdeli Bee Products, Kuaishou, Taobao, and other well-known chain store networks, live broadcast platforms, and e-commerce platforms promote “enterprise + apiary + grower” exchange and cooperation, connect online and offline channels, and continue to issue “Qinghai Plateau Spring Jelly Consumption Vouchers” to consumers, helping these customers earn an estimated total annual profit of nearly 5.28 million yuan.
Wu Na, CEO of Beijing Houdeli Bee Products, said the event was “very worthwhile”: “This event helps grow the popularity of Qinghai bee products, helps more consumers to learn about and appreciate pure, natural bee products without additives, and drives beekeeper income growth.” “
Currently, the company has signed strategic production cooperation agreements with Qinghai Cloud Honey LTD and Qinghai Huabao Bee Industry Holdings LTD, and they will work together to promote the rapid development of Qinghai’s bee products industry.

This spring, due to roadblocks set up to control the epidemic, beekeepers have been blocked from their usual “following the flowers to produce honey” routes, many bees have died of starvation because they missed the flowering periods, and beekeeper incomes have suffered a sharp decline.
Throughout the year, beekeepers typically travel long distances to follow the flowering periods, from Yunnan and Sichuan all the way to the northwest, they are exposed to the weather and have no fixed residence, and it’s very difficult work.
We have a responsibility as entrepreneurs to help them, “
said Wu Na.
“Bees are ‘nature’s advance scouts’, because they can’t survive in heavily polluted areas. “ Zhao Xiaochuan, deputy secretary of the China Bee Products Association, explained that pollination by bees is a very important link in the ecological chain, and that it plays an irreplaceable role in protecting plant diversity and improving the environment.
Bee pollination also increases the yield and quality of crops, and is even more important in regions with a wide diversity of crops and poor farm management.
Research data proves that pollination improves rapeseed yields by 15-30%.

“The economic, environmental, and social benefits of bee pollination go far beyond the mere value of the bee products, and the apiary industry has enormous potential in the areas of human health, plant reproduction, and environmental protection, but there has never been wide awareness of this fact, “
said Zhao Xiaochuan.
The number of beekeepers is declining, but in addition to the traveling industry professionals, there are also many poor households with limited mobility who practice beekeepers as part of cooperatives.
“The country offers financial support, and we’ve contacted technology experts for help and guidance, but beekeepers lack understanding and discernment of the market environment, so opening new markets requires help and coordination from government, enterprises, and industry associations, “
said Zhao Xiaochuan.
“I hope people will pay more attention to beekeepers and offer them support in the future,” said Wu Na. “And as we strive to help beekeepers, we strictly adhere to national standards in the selection and control of our bee products to ensure quality and protect the rights of consumers.” “

The Possibility of Victory is adapted from historical facts, and is based on Soviet Union military archive materials which have been classified for many years.
During the Fight for Moscow, the elite Far Eastern army of the Soviet Red Army went west to assist in the fight, but at that time the “Going North Faction” of Japan’s Kwantung Army held the view that there would be opportunities in the north, so troops should be sent.
To defeat their enemies in the front and the rear, information staff of Communist Party of China and Soviet Union jointly launched “Mudanura” plan.

The heroine Cai Meng is Chief of Linhe Security Bureau, who is deeply beloved by her Japanese leader Fukuwara, and there is a subtle relationship between her and Tang Fei, making them “frenemies” with a romantic undertone.
Su Qing has attempted to play different roles in recent years, from Lu Ruowen in We Were Young in Those Years to Erqing in Story of Yanxi Palace, all of which left a deep impression upon the general public, and her skill is now widely recognized.
This is the first collaboration between Su Qing and Liu Yunlong, a stuttering policeman an an enchanting policewoman, and is both eye-catching and novel.
Apart from the two protagonists, many skilled actors, including Liang Guanhua, Li Liqun, Qian Bo, Lei Han, Shen Junyi, also perform in the TV series, which makes it even more attractive.
According to sources, the production is very detailed, and the crew selected venues in three provinces, including Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Liaoning provinces, travelling nearly 2,000 kilometers.
To restore the gorgeous urban appearance of Northeast China as captured by Japanese invaders, the art and prop team worked around the clock, carefully designing every detail of the settings and props, which enables the richly detailed scenes and captures the historical essence of the era.

Greenland Launches a New Round of Mixed Reform, and Shanghai State-owned Assets Transfers 17.5% of Its Shares - www.eeo.com.cn - Professional Financial News Website
Eeo.com.cn reporter Rao Xianjun, July 26, Greenland Holdings (600606.SH) issued a "Suggestive Announcement on the State-owned Shareholders' Intention to Transfer Part of the Company's Shares and Resume Trading through Public Solicitation of the Transferee."
According to the announcement, in order to further deepen the reform of state-owned assets and state-owned enterprises, optimize the structural adjustment of state-owned assets, and improve the ownership structure of Greenland, Shanghai Land (Group) Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as "Shanghai Land") and Shanghai Chengtou Investment (Group) Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as "Shanghai Chengtou Investment") plan to transfer part of the shares of the company held by the transferee through public solicitation, and the total proportion of the shares to be transferred shall not exceed 17.5% of the total share capital of Greenland.
The price of the shares to be transferred this time shall not be lower than the higher of the following two: the arithmetic average of the daily weighted average price of the 30 trading days before the suggestive announcement date (July 27, 2020); the audited net asset value per share of the company in the latest accounting year.
At present, there is still no final conclusion on the new strategic investors of Greenland, but according to the information estimates in the announcement, the new strategic investors need to pay about RMB 14 billion to take the 17.5% equity transferred in the mixed-use reform of Greenland.
It is worth noting that after the completion of the share transfer, Greenland is expected to have no controlling shareholders and actual controllers, but the control structure may change greatly.
Since its establishment, Greenland Holdings has carried out many institutional reforms: from 1992 to 1997, it was operated under the pure state-owned system in accordance with market-oriented rules; from 1997 to 2013, it established and continuously improved the joint-stock system of state-owned holding and employee shareholding; from 2013 to 2015, strategic investors were introduced to form a mixed ownership system of cross-shareholding and mutual integration of state-owned and non-public capital; and since 2015, the company has been entirely listed and has become a public company.
Greenland's current mixed reform plan is similar to Gree's: in December 2019, Zhuhai Mingjun, led by Hillhouse Capital, took over 15% of the shares of Gree Electric Appliances (000651.SZ) with RMB 41.662 billion, and the Gree Group retreated to being the minority shareholder; after the completion of the mixed reform, Gree implemented modern enterprise management methods, such as executive incentive plans and no real controller structure.
Shanghai Land and Shanghai Chengtou Investment are all state-owned enterprise groups wholly owned by Shanghai SASAC, and Zhang Yuliang, chairman and president of Greenland holdings, said that Greenland's move is an important measure for Shanghai to promote the comprehensive reform of state-owned assets and enterprises and accelerate the reform of state-owned assets and enterprises in the new era in accordance with the requirements of the CPC Central Committee; it also fully shows the new concept of reform that adapts measures to local conditions and acts according to actual circumstances, because it is necessary to introduce new shareholders to support the reform of corporate strategy, further improve the degree of corporate management freedom, and accelerate the full release of reform vitality.

White House Adviser “Counterattacks” States’ Premature Reopening-ChinaNews.com
White House Adviser “Counterattacks” States’ Premature Reopening
As of July 23 local time, the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the United States topped 4 million, accounting for 30% of global cases.
For months, U.S. President Trump has repeatedly asked for states to reopen businesses and schools, and only recently changed his attitude and started wearing masks in public, while his advisers accuse some state governments of reopening businesses too early.
On 22nd, White House adviser Kellyanne Conway said at a press conference that some states didn’t follow reopening standards and opened businesses like bars too early.
Conway also mentioned that statements regarding the President having “absolute power” in deciding states reopening matters are misinformed rumors.
“The President is a federalist who believes in the autonomous rights of states. "
she said in Trump’s defense.
However, this so-called “rumor” was stated by Trump himself at the White House outbreak briefing on April 13.
This flip-flop was mocked on the internet as “rewriting history”.
Attempting to rewrite history makes Kellyanne Conway a liar.
Trump called Gretchen Whitmer, governor of Michigan, a dictator because she followed medical guidelines and insisted on lockdown.
Trump wanted to facilitate reopening so that he could hold rallies.
This isn’t the first time Kellyanne Conway has caused controversy.
On April 15, when interviewed by Fox News, Conway blurted out, “This is COVID-19, not COVID-1, folks! "
She seemed to have taken “19” as a version number and was laughed at on the internet, “Read a newspaper if you have no common sense!”

When playing on sports ground of an university, 3-year old Xiaowen was accidentally hit in the head by a softball thrown by Chen from the softball team.
After being compensated by Chen for the accident, Xiaowen’s father, acting as Xiaowen’s legal guardian, sued the university in court, demanding an apology for what happened on the sports ground and a total of 20,000 yuan for medical bills and emotional distress.
Recently, the People’s Court of Haidian District in Beijing heard the case and believed the university fulfilled its obligation to provide appropriate safety assurance by setting up a protective barrier at the sports ground; in addition, Chen had already compensated for the accident, and therefore, the claims of the plaintiff were dismissed.
As Mr. Wen claims, he took Xiaowen to the sports ground of the university during summer vacation in 2019, and the softball team was training on the sports ground at the same time.
To avoid potential risks, Xiaowen and Mr. Wen and other parents and children were playing in a safety area designated by the softball team.
However, later when Chen, a member of the softball team, was throwing the ball, it slipped out of his hand, went over the protective barrier into the safety area, and hit Xiaowen in the back of her head.
Mr. Wen took Xiaowen to the hospital immediately, and she was diagnosed as having head trauma.
Mr. Wen believes the sports field facilities are not in line with safety regulations and the university failed to effectively manage the softball team and relevant facilities.
It was negligence of the university that led to the incident, which caused physical and mental distress for Xiaowen and her family, hence the university should take legal responsibility.
Against these accusations, the university argued that it has set up protective barrier around the sports field and posted management regulations and training notices informing people to keep a safe distance from the training field when entering the sports ground and to be aware of their personal safety, and because the plaintiff couldn’t prove the university “didn’t fulfill safety assurance obligations”, the university refused to pay compensation.
After hearing the case, the court believed the venue where the incident took place is open to public for free, and though the university bears safety assurance obligations for the sports ground, the extent of its obligations were merely to have general notices.
When the incident took place, there was a protective barrier set up by the university on the sports ground, meaning the appropriate safety assurance obligations were fulfilled, and Chen paid over 2,000 yuan in compensation for Xiaowen’s medical bill, transportation, and other losses according to the compensation agreement reached, so the two parities agreed to settle their dispute once and for all.
Afterwards, Xiaowen’s parents’ claims for compensation from the university was found to be groundless, and the court ruled to dismiss all claims of the plaintiff.
After neither party decided to appeal, the verdict became effective.
According to Article 37 of Tort Liability Law, as the manager of a public place, the university bears safety assurance obligations; and when actions of a third party cause damages to others, the third party takes tort liability, while manager of the public place that fails to fulfill safety assurance obligations takes complementary liabilities.
The judge stated that because manager of the public place is the party most likely to know the actual state of the site, and to foresee potential dangers and harms, it is the most likely party to take necessary measures to prevent losses from happening or reduce damages and to keep the cost of damage prevention or reduction to a minimum, meaning the law requires it to bear the appropriate safety assurance obligations when engaging in social activities.
In this case, for the non-specific group of people entering the sports ground open to public for free, the school’s safety assurance obligation were in line with the social activities it was engaged in, specifically which were primarily to take basic safety measures and to inform people of hidden dangers.
In juridical practice, it’s not advised to make safety assurance obligations too high or too strict for the managers of public places.
If the university has set up a protective barrier and fulfilled its duty to inform, the university is considered not at fault and does not bear legal responsibility.
Furthermore, as to third party tort, even if the manager of public places such as a university doesn’t fulfill its safety assurance obligations, its liability is complementary to damage compensation; according to the new Civil Code, the manager can claim compensation from the third party after assuming complementary liability.
Therefore, the victim must not expand the scope of the claim after receiving compensation from the directly liable party in this kind of accident.
With regular pandemic prevention and control, people are more enthusiastic about exercise and fitness.

However, since 1997, as the rural population has gradually flowed into the town, there are increasing number of residents in Gao'anchang town, which has caused increasingly serious environmental pollution.
Paper mills, chemical plants, and breeding farms were built along the Longxi River, which also polluted the river.

"The scales of the fish are black, and their stomachs are black, too. "

Israel Strengthens Measures to Prevent Epidemic from Recurring-Ecns.cn

Israel strengthens measures to prevent epidemic from recurring
At the beginning of the epidemic outbreak, Israel's prevention and control measures were effective.
However, with the gradual lifting of the ban, the number of confirmed cases in Israel has recently increased significantly, and the Israeli government has taken several emergency measures to strengthen its epidemic prevention and control.
On February 28, the first case was confirmed in Israel and prompt measures were taken to close all entry and exit points, suspend non-essential industries, and urge all schools to take classes online; moreover, they restricted public transportation and non-essential social activities, sealed off cities with severe outbreaks, and combined military and police efforts to maintain effective control and prevention measures.
This series of measures quickly yielded positive results, and by mid-May, the daily number of confirmed cases in Israel dropped to the single digits.
As the outbreak was brought under control, the blockade was completely lifted and the number of new confirmed cases has gradually seen a recurrence since June.
In particular, in July, the spread of the epidemic has accelerated since the beginning of the month.
Recently, the number of new confirmed cases in Israel has been above 1,500 per day for eight days, and by the time of this report on July 25, the number of new confirmed cases reached 916.
As of July 25, there were 59,745 confirmed cases and 448 death cases in Israel.
In the face of this rapid recurrence, the Israeli government has taken several emergency measures to strengthen epidemic prevention and control.
On July 6, after the number of confirmed cases exceeded 30,000, the Israeli government closed gyms, swimming pools, bars, nightclubs and other public entertainment venues, and introduced a policy of limiting public transport to a maximum of 20 passengers per bus.
On July 17, the government announced a series of new restrictions, including a "city lockdown" on weekends, from 17:00 every Friday to 5:00 every Sunday.
During this period, people will be allowed to go out but the shops, shopping centers, barber shops, beauty salons, libraries, zoos, museums, exhibition halls, swimming pools and tourist attractions will be closed; however, places providing basic services such as supermarkets and pharmacies will remain open.
In the meantime, gatherings of more than 10 people will be banned around the clock every day, gyms, studios, and other places will be closed, and restaurants and cafes will be closed for dine-in food, with only takeaway services allowed.
As yet, the Israeli public is not fully aware of the seriousness of the epidemic and fails to cooperate with the government in fighting against it.
In spite of the epidemic’s recurrence in Israel, many people have taken to the streets in protest at the government's control measures that affected the public economic interests.
On July 11, tens of thousands of people demonstrated in Tel Aviv, arguing that anti-epidemic policies were affecting the economy.
On the evening of the 21st, thousands of protesters gathered in front of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's residence in Jerusalem to protest against the ban on dine-in food in restaurants and cafes and the lack of compensation.
In addition, many people did not comply with the rules to wear masks and maintain a safe social distance of two meters when going outdoors, and many people only wore masks on their chins or hung them on their wrists to avoid being fined by the police for not wearing them.
During the epidemic recurrence, schools have been the most affected places by the COVID-19; according to a recent reporter’s visit to a kindergarten, it was found that teachers and students did not wear masks as required by the government, nor did they keep a safe social distance of two meters, thus creating a potential risk for a large number of teachers and students to be exposed to the virus.
Professor Eli Waxman, a member of the expert advisory group of the National Security Council of Israel on combating the epidemic, believes that Israel is heading towards a "dangerous situation", adding that the measures currently being taken to prevent and control the epidemic are insufficient and that all leisure and entertainment activities and summer schools should be closed in order to control the further spread of the epidemic.
Waxman states that Israel lacks an overall plan to combat the epidemic and that the Knesset and all government departments should put aside their own interests and agree on a clear step to combat the epidemic, including clear restrictions in different sectors.
Tel Aviv, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Reporter in Tel Aviv, Wang Jiong
Wu Fengfang, a farmer in Guyuan City of Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, couldn't turn down her husband Dai Tianfu, so they started off by car from their home and arrived the Liang Yun Cultural Courtyard 10 kilometers away.
Despite the fact that he has had difficulty walking over the past two years, the 77-year-old Dai Tianfu still expects to "come here every now and then to have a good time".
This is an inconspicuous courtyard in the Yuanzhou District of Guyuan, but unlike other ordinary farmhouses, songs of melodious Shanxi opera are often heard from this one, as well as terrific shadow plays, embroidery works, traditional Shaanxi opera and Meihu plays.
The owner of the courtyard is called Liang Yun, who used to be a carpenter.
More than 10 years ago, he began to design and construct the cultural courtyard because of his passion for shadow plays and opera.
With the Liang Yun Cultural Courtyard, villagers' cultural life has become much richer.
Before this reporter walked into the Liang Yun Cultural Courtyard, the melody of Shanxi opera was already wafting through the air.
The person who performing the Shaanxi opera excerpts for the villagers is Bo Lixiang, a villager from a neighboring village.
She has had a passion for Shanxi opera since childhood, is now well known locally, and she has free time, she comes to the cultural courtyard to perform for the villagers.
Recently, she has also taken up live webcasting.
“It's a blessing to have a stage where more people can see my performance," she said .
On the stage, the performers sing well and follow the instrumental melody, and despite being amateurs, their enthusiasm is undiminished.
Just like the rustic nature of the farmhouse, besides the Shanxi opera, the Liang Yun Cultural Courtyard is full of "grassroots" art and intangible cultural heritage.
The courtyard also has a collection of over 300 items from different eras, including farming equipment, traditional and handmade sculptures, paper-cutting, embroidery and shadow puppets.
Liang Yun leads the reporter into the exhibition hall, which displays his collection of old objects, such as old wine pots, Sanxianzi (stringed instruments), and spindle wheels.
Why did an ordinary farmer build a cultural courtyard?
"Shadow puppetry is my family's craft passed down from a long time ago, and I have been learning this since I was 15 years old. .
The Liang Yun Cultural Courtyard was established in 2012 and became the first rural "Intangible Cultural Heritage Exhibition Hall" in Ningxia, as well as a demonstration courtyard for protecting intangible cultural heritage in Guyuan.
In addition to the Liang Yun Cultural Courtyard, more than 120 cultural courtyards have appeared in Yuanzhou District of Guyuan City, as well as 79 folk performance groups, of which there are more than 50 cultural courtyards of a certain scale, such as Shenjiahe Cultural Courtyard, Wang Yonghong Cultural Courtyard, and Yang Lang Cultural Courtyard, which are dispersed all over towns and streets in the Yuanzhou District, with more than 5,000 performers.
These grassroots artists are active in their fields, enriching the cultural life of the masses and satisfying the public’s cultural needs.
"As life gets better and better, traditional culture can't just be utterly forgotten. .
“Liu’s Spy TV Series” Returns with The Possibility of Victory with Performances from Liu Yunlong and Li Liqun - Xinhua Net
The 40-episode spy TV series The Possibility of Victory will be broadcast on Beijing TV on July 16.
The Possibility of Victory is adapted from real historical facts, which was based on military archives of the Soviet Union which have been sealed for many years and revealed to the public for the first time.
Liu Yunlong, an actor well-known for his spy TV series, has made a breakthrough new work of art, acting as a “stuttering service agent” who is comical, which is soon to be broadcast.
In recent years, the popularity of TV series including Pretender, Mask, and Kite proves the great appeal of spy TV series.
Different from previous spy TV series, The Possibility of Victory takes a global view, extending its context to Far Eastern battlefield in the Soviet Union.
It is based in the final stage of the Resistance War against the Japanese invasion in 1944, and tells the story about Tang Fei (played by Liu Yunlong), a secret agent of the Communist Party of China, who, led by Communist Party’s President of Linhe Province and Director of Far Eastern Information Bureau of Soviet Union, executes the Soviet Union’s “Mudanura” strategic plan.
In many spy TV series, the heroes are all impeccably handsome and mature super spies with superb IQ’s when they first appear on screen.
But in the opinion of Liu Yunlong, such people are not suitable to be spies, “Spies should be someone who won’t be recognized in the mass, and if he or she appears cool or handsome at first glance, he or she will attract nearly all the attention, so how can he or she hide in the enemy’s camp? There is a line in Kite, “If you hadn’t caught me, I would have nearly forgetten my identity as a member of Nationalist Party of China”, which shows how spies should not be presented as elites. ”
Therefore, in The Possibility of Victory, Liu Yunlong’s original idea was to design the hero Tang Fei as a comical “stuttering secret agent”.
The “enemy” camp in The Possibility of Victory, is led by the Japanese Fukuwara, played by Liang Guanhua, and Director of the Police Fang Shibao, played by Li Liqun.
These two skilled actors, one of whom comes from Northern China and the other from Southern China, invigorate multiple wonderful scenes in the TV series.
The director Yin Fei describes the performance of Li Liqun and Liu Yunlong as “an acting battle”, “It was definitely a battle, they coordinated very well with each other, which was very moving for me. At many times, their performance was “improvised”, for instance, the script was only half a page, but without my disruption, they would continue their performance. ”
Masters don’t steal the show from others, and directors never disrupt a performance; all the actors were immersed in the characters, allowing them to not only craft the roles from the perspective of their characters, but also create more possibilities for the audience, and Yin Fei praised such performances as marvelous.
In the TV series, many familiar faces from “Liu’s spy TV series” can also be seen; for instance, three actors from the popular and influential “Mountain Town F4” in Kite have roles in The Possibility of Victory.
Hou Yu and Liu Mingyang, who play Song Xiao’an and Zhao Jianzhi respectively, serve as Tang Fei’s core assistants again.
Director Yin Fei said, “They don’t have any deep-rooted bad habits, they just followed the mainstream in that era, and that environment. ”
Liu Yunlong also said, “We should care about humanity.” This means that there must be good and bad people, and the villains are enemies, but they should be presented well, and the good guys should also be presented properly. ”
The endings of the two characters were also carefully designed by Liu Yunlong, who believes that they will satisfy the audience.

The Lancet Article Praise China’s Pandemic Efforts and Encourages Countries to Learn from Its Experience-ChinaNews.com
The Lancet published an article on the 25th, saying that China, as a country with 1.4 billion population and the size similar to Europe or the U.S., has effectively contained COVID-19 outbreak at this stage, with no mass transmission again, and that it has the domestic pandemic under control to a great extent.
As the article mentioned, China’s large investment in domestic research and public health reinforcement over the past decade made China much more prepared for COVID-19 than it was for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).
The author wrote, when SARS broke out in 2002, China wasn’t prepared at the beginning, especially since it wasn’t able to identify the pathogen.
When coronavirus was discovered in December 2019, Chinese scientists quickly identified the species of the virus and shared the genome sequencing data with the international community on January 11, 2020.
By the end of January, doctors from Mainland China and Hong Kong knew the clinical characteristics of the virus and published research papers in The Lancet to warn the world about the threat of the coronavirus.
China is also on the frontline of vaccine research, and when the national emergency state was announced, vaccine research was conducted swiftly and rigorously through close domestic collaborations; in May and July, early trial results of COVID-19 vaccines developed by China were published in The Lancet.
China’s experience shows the importance of investment in national health and research systems to effectively improve laboratory capabilities.
It’s the foundation of a nation’s fast and effective response to health emergencies and global health safety issues.
It’s a lesson worth learning for other countries, especially low and middle income countries.
Aside from strong research capabilities, China’s experience proves that strong leadership is necessary to make right decisions based on science, and was key to the effective control of COVID-19.
The article underlines the fact that a government and its leaders must respect science and understand the value of science, so as to take actions most beneficial to society.
At the beginning of the outbreak, National Health Commission of China sent three groups of infectious disease experts to Wuhan to investigate risks and transmission of the coronavirus, whose suggestions informed the decision to “lock down” Wuhan on January 23, and when some experts presented the necessity and urgency to build mobile cabin hospitals, the government quickly made the decision and implemented their advice while also seeking broad engagement with communities and the people, which contributed to the fast and effective control over the outbreak.
In the end, the article emphasizes, when facing global health emergencies, countries should strengthen global collaboration to jointly combat challenges.

The cause of the crash is still unclear.
Citing the police’s explanation, the Rheinische Post reported that there were clues that the plane may have disintegrated before it hit the residential building.
Police said that several parts of the crashed plane were found in the vicinity of the accident.
The German criminal police are investigating the cause of the crash together with the Duisburg prosecutors and BFU.
This reporter learned from the Consulate-General of the People's Republic of China In Dusseldorf on the same day that the consulate contacted the local police and fire service, and judging from the scene, there were no Chinese citizens among the casualties.
The Ministry of Health of Singapore announced on the 26th that as of 12 o'clock that day, the latest development came as another 481 people in Singapore tested positive for COVID-19, and the country now has a total of 50,369 cases and 27 deaths.
Data showed that among the newly confirmed cases, 5 were local community cases, 4 were imported cases, and the rest were foreign workers living in dedicated dormitories.
The Ministry of Health of Singapore reported that 98% of the newly confirmed cases were related to known infections.
There are still 173 confirmed COVID-19 cases receiving treatment in the hospital, most of whom are in stable or improving condition, and no one is in the intensive care unit.
In addition, 4,648 people are quarantined in communities.
Foreign workers account for the vast majority of people infected with COVID-19 in Singapore.
According to statistics, there are 200,000 foreign workers living in 43 dedicated dormitories for foreign workers, and about 100,000 foreign workers living in other types of dormitories.
The Singapore Anti-pandemic Interdepartmental Working Group recently stated that the Singapore government was stepping up testing for the last few foreign workers’ dormitories with high rates of COVID-19 infection.
After completing the testing of all dedicated dormitories, the vast majority of foreign workers will be able to return to work, but they will still have to undergo regular COVID-19 testing.
The Reunions Directed by Da Peng Nominated by SIFF for Golden Goblet Awards - Xinhua Net
On July 18, 2020, the 23rd Shanghai International Film Festival announced the official nominated films for Golden Goblet Awards.
The first realistic film, The Reunions, directed by Da Peng, was nominated for the 23rd SIFF Golden Goblet Awards, and at the same time published its first poster.
Poster provided by producer
The Reunions is Da Peng’s first realistic film, and is his second brush with the Golden Goblet Awards.
It tells the story of a comedy director who has a sudden inspiration to return her hometown village in Northeast China and make an art movie about famiiy reunions during Spring Festival, but who encounters a series of accidents.
The family members finally together for the film and have their final reunion.
On the film poster published today, a member of the family, “Third Uncle” Wang Jixiang, sits in the center with a cigarette, and in the background is the black land of Northeast China covered by white snow, while the foreground is red lanterns hung for festivals.
The red lanterns symbolizing festivity and reunion contrast sharply with the lonely Wang Jixiang, and seem to show the complexity of large families.
According to reports, in the film, apart from the daughter of the “third uncle” Wang Jixiang, played by Liu Lu, all other characters were played by the directors’ family themselves, and this experimental audiovisual style breaks down the border between drama and reality, bringing about a brand new immersive experience for the audience.
According to Da Peng, inspiration came from “accidents”, a series of family accidents during production, which changed the original production plan; the use of real-life performances without scripts was finally recorded as a film, creating a film far different from what he originally imagined.
How did Da Peng face these “accidents”, and how did he embrace the changes brought about by the “accidents”?
There is no doubt that The Reunions is fully experimental: none of the cast are professionally trained, and the audiovisual style is quite creative, which transforms life into a movie, and composed of real-life videos, the audience will certainly find someone like themselves and their family, so that at the end of the film, it inspires deep thoughts.

Platoon leader Yu Wang and a soldier stand guard at the Banong Zhuokang Sentinel Post.
In this place where the average temperature annually is more than ten degrees below zero, a row of simply-decorated barracks stands at the pass, with a national flag flying in the wind not far from the barracks; soldiers here are on duty every day in the wind, while regularly patrolling to higher-altitude locations.
The soldiers climb up steep and rocky slopes on their hands and feet.
In late July, when lower altitudes are covered with flowers and leafy plants, only the ravine behind the barracks is relatively dense with greenery in Banong Zhuokang.
Gao Peng, a soldier who has been stationed at the post for six years, pointed to the ravine and said that it was their back garden, and that only in July and August every year can they see the grass growing slowly, and shortly afterwards it all turns yellow and is covered with snow.
A single foot patrol can take around nine hours.
In the tough plateau environment, the soldiers stationed here are constantly in the company of snow-capped mountains and glaciers, and they need to patrol passes on foot at high altitudes regularly.
Now, a patrol team of eight soldiers, led by instructor Liang Yixin, takes to the patrol route once again.
Each soldier carries a weight of about 30 jin, and heads for the destination early in the morning.
On the way, one soldier suffers from altitude sickness and is helped by his partners.
In addition to patrol duty, soldiers at the Banong Zhuokang Sentinel Post also need to conduct tactical and physical training on a daily basis.
The oxygen level gets lower and lower as time passes and the altitude rises, and these factors test the will of patrol members whose physical strength has been constantly overexerted.
Yet they grit their teeth and persevered in crossing several landslides and challenging rapids.
At around 16:00, it was lunchtime for the patrol, and they sat down on the ground at an altitude of more than 5,700 meters, regardless of rain and snow, to replenish their strength with solid food for lunch.
The soldiers at the Banong Zhuokang Sentinel Post need to conduct tactical and physical training on a daily basis.
During breaks, they play cards together, and the loser is required to do push-ups, which is both entertaining and good for body building.
After a short break in the cold wind, they climbed up to the destination of this patrol, and when they arrived, they took out the national flag on the mountain pass and swore a solemn oath.
Behind them are the snow-capped mountains, and in front of them was a no-man's land stretching for dozens of kilometers, but they are the trustworthy guardians of this national gate.
“Beijing Consumption Season” resumes - Xinhuanet
Based on the principles of “comprehensive resumption, focused planning, orderly progression, and tight-knit organization”, the various activities of the “Beijing Consumption Season” have been resumed.
On July 26th, 1.5 million government and consumption vouchers were released, of which 1 million were offline dining and shopping vouchers and 500,000 were smart product vouchers, which could be claimed by consumers on the JD app.
On the 25th, Liu Meiying, deputy secretary of the Beijing Municipal Commerce Bureau, explained at a press conference that after the resumption, existing enterprise subsidies for consumption vouchers will be kept in place, and enterprise capital allocations will be further reduced.
From the start of August, the current 1:1 allocation of government capital for enterprises will be changed to 2:1, meaning that if a consumer has a discount voucher worth 120 yuan at a particular store, originally, the government subsidy was 60 yuan, and the enterprise contribution was 60 yuan; after the adjustment, the government subsidy is 80 yuan, and the enterprise contribution is 40 yuan.
During the Consumption Season event, the three major telecom carriers will provide subsidized 5G quota and terminals to further promote Beijing’s new 5G infrastructure and 5G consumption.

China News Service, Hong Kong, reported July 26th Financial Secretary of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, Paul Chan Mo-po, said on the 26th that Hong Kong faces a new COVID-19 outbreak, and that even businesses and economic sectors which had shown signs of recovery were being affected.
The SAR government again called on all large and small property owners to reduce rents to allow retailers, restaurants, and small and medium-sized businesses to get through this difficult period.
The same day, Paul Chan Mo-po published an article online entitled “The Difficult Road to Recovery”.
He said that the high number of new confirmed COVID-19 cases recently in Hong Kong and the SAR’s dire situation have impacted people’s livelihoods and disrupted the economy.
As a new wave of the outbreak emerges, the most important tasks are to prevent imported cases and quickly handle and interrupt the chain of infection; once the epidemic is under control, economic activity can resume at the appropriate time.
He also pointed out that with the new wave of infections, even businesses and economic sectors which had shown signs of recovery were being affected.
For those in the business world, a sense of responsibility is just as important as keeping contracts, especially among companies that have received large government subsidies from the Employment Guarantee Program.
He stressed that although Hong Kong’s economic distress in this year’s second quarter was severe, the contraction showed slight signs of slowing.
In terms of exports, he believes that Hong Kong’s situation abroad remains dire.
Paul Chan Mo-po also said that Hong Kong’s history of economic over the past several decades proves that new opportunities can be found in every crisis, and that every difficulty holds the keys to future development.
Earthquake off Taiwan’s eastern coast is year’s strongest to date - chinanews.com
China News Service, Taipei, reported July 26th: A Richter 6.1-magnitude earthquake occurred in Taiwan’s eastern waters at 20:52 on the 26th, with a maximum seismicity of 4, causing all of Taiwan to feel the shaking, which was Taiwan’s strongest earthquake this year.
According to reports from the Central News Agency, the China Times, ETtoday, and other Taiwanese media, Taiwan’s China Weather Bureau measurements place the earthquake’s epicenter 86.5 km from the provincial capital, in the ocean southeast of the island, with a focal depth of 53 km.
The China Earthquake Network rated the earthquake level at 5.5.
Across Taiwan, the highest earthquake intensity was felt in Hualien County at Level 4, Yilan County, Taitung County, Nantou County, and Yunlin County at 3, and other counties and cities between 1 to 2.
Taiwan’s China Weather Bureau stated that this was the strongest earthquake of the year in Taiwan, that it was a submerged zone earthquake at the junction between tectonic plates, and that the area has experienced frequent earthquakes in the past and is relatively active this year.
They did not rule out that aftershocks of magnitude 4 or above may occur in the next week.
Marinichev said that changes in value have been affected by the devaluation of the ruble and the Covid-19 epidemic.
He said,"The cost of services is increasing.
Because of the epidemic, people are beginning to spend more time on the Internet. ”
Marinichev did not rule out heavy price increases next year, arguing that operators could offer customers higher speeds and more services to offset dissatisfaction with higher prices.
“Chinese Doctors” pays tribute in film to heroes of the fight against the epidemic - Xinhuanet
Recently, representing the respects of Chinese filmmakers for the heroes of the fight against the epidemic, Bona Pictures board chairman Yu Dong and film director Liu Weiqiang (left in image) held a discussion and exchange symposium with academician Zhong Nanshan on the filming and production work for “Chinese Doctors”, a film about the fight against the epidemic.
Bona Pictures hopes, through “Chinese Doctors”, to pay tribute to all medical staff and epidemic control workers fighting on the front line in the fight against the epidemic!
In 2021, the film will be showed nationwide as part of the celebrations surrounding the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China.
Currently, under the arrangement and direction of the Publicity Department of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the China Film Administration, and with the support of the Guangdong Province Film Administration and Hubei Province Film Administration, Bona Pictures is organizing the original crew of “The Captain” to film “Chinese Doctors”, a film that will reflect the unified effort of the whole nation to fight the COVID-19 epidemic under the firm leadership of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party.
The film will focus on the front line of the fight against the epidemic in Wuhan, feature Wuhan medical personnel and the medical aid teams from the various provinces as characters, and from the perspective of different personalities, use unique narratives and highly impactful cinematic language to provide a panoramic view of the moving story of the deep spirit of dedication and sacrifice among China’s medical personnel in the fight against the epidemic.
It is reported that from the first moment of the day Wuhan was placed under lockdown, Bona Pictures overcame numerous obstacles to dispatch filming teams to the front lines of the fight against the epidemic, where they conducted face-to-face exchanges and footage collection with hundreds of medical workers, as well as interviews with Zhong Nanshan, the first rescue worker to arrive in Wuhan from Guangzhou, the medical aid team dispatched to Hubei from Guangdong, and the angels in white lab coats who formed the vanguard of the battle against the epidemic from institutions including Wuhan Jinyitan Hospital, Wuhan Union Hospital, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, and the Central Hospital of Wuhan, ultimately obtaining large amounts of precious first-hand footage.
At the symposium, academician Zhong Nanshan also expressed his hopes and expectations for the film, “I look forward to it, and I hope that while you feature some of the more publicly known experts, the majority of your interviews should focus on the medical workers who worked so diligently on the front lines. “
He stated that he had previously seen “My People, My Country” and “The Captain”, and thought that telling the larger story from the perspective of ordinary people was a good technique.
“Some of our foreign friends still have some misunderstandings about China. “
Discussing the film’s distribution, academician Zhong Nanshan said that currently, some people in foreign countries say the virus is a politicized topic, so he hopes the humanity of the film’s perspective will move the audience, “Beyond just being screened in China, it’s best if the film can also be screened abroad, so the film should be shot in a manner that allows both foreign and domestic audiences to understand and genuinely be moved. “
He fondly recalls the 1980’s film “At Middle Age”, saying, “After so many years, the opening up and reform-era film that made the deepest impression on me is still ‘At Middle Age’, which moved my foreign doctor friends to tears, so it would be wonderful if ‘Chinese Doctors’ could have the same effect. “
Academician Zhong Nanshan said that if “Chinese Doctors” resonates with foreign audiences, it will be a great success.
He also shared his opinions and advice on China’s current epidemic control work, saying, “I’m sure people will always be smarter than viruses. “
Zhong Nanshan said that although the virus is unpredictable, since primal times, humanity has overcome countless dangers, and with the advanced medical technology and social management measures we have in modern times, as well as the help of the global medical community and the universal basic awareness of scientific measures for combatting COVID-19 among the general population, humanity will no longer be as helpless as before, “There are two things we have to focus on, the first being how to strengthen global cooperation, and the second how to provide emotional comfort and support for people.

“Red Fruits” of Culture and Tourism Gathering in Shaoshan —The First Xiangtan Red Culture Industry Expo - News Today -Hunan Daily - www.voc.com.cn
Hunan Daily, New Hunan Client, by journalist Jiang Rui and correspondent Xiao Yan
On July 25, the 2020 Hunan Red Tourism Culture Festival was held in Shaoshan, which exhibits red boat molds from Jiaxing, a bronze sculpture of Chairman Mao from Shaoshan, cloth sticker handicrafts of Yan’an, Xiangxi Yongshun bacon, and so on.
As one of the main activities, the First Xiangtan Red Culture Industry Expo was held in Shaoshan Tourism Consulting Center.
The red cultural and creative products in the exhibition area and the local products in the old revolutionary base areas attracted tourists from all over the world to buy them.
"The Red Culture Industry Expo is not only an exhibition of the achievements of the national red culture industry, but also an important platform for exhibitors and enterprises to exchange experiences and explore models of development. “
According to the person in charge of the Executive Committee of the First Xiangtan Red Culture Industry Expo, the theme of the Expo was "promoting red culture and boosting culture and tourism", the total exhibition area was nearly 3,000 square meters, and an atmosphere creation area, scenic area exhibiting area, and red culture and tourism online shopping experiencing area were also set up.
137 enterprises and units from Jiaxing, Zunyi and Yan'an, as well as Changsha, Zhuzhou, Yueyang and Chenzhou were invited to participate in the exhibition, and a total of 768 kinds of exhibits were exhibited, including red cultural relics, handicrafts, food specialties, tourism routes, red training courses, and red cultural and creative products.
The exhibition area will be open until July 29.
As the host of the Red Culture Industry Expo, there were many bright spots in Xiangtan exhibition area.
According to the person in charge of the exhibition area, the Xiangtan exhibition area was divided into two parts: the red industry and the red cultural industry.
The red industry exhibition area displayed 31 exhibits from six enterprises, including Xiangtan Iron & Steel Co.,Ltd. of Hualin, Hunan, Hunan Hualin Wire & Cable Co.,Ltd, and XEMC, as well as nearly 200 products from 27 organizations, including red book series, red food series, red cultural series and creative products, which were displayed in the red cultural industry development exhibition area.

Total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Japan exceeds 30,000 - Xinhuanet
Statistics show that on the 26th, 239 new cases were confirmed in Tokyo, keeping the city’s number of confirmed cases above 200 for 6 days in a row, for a total of 11,214 cumulative cases.
There were also 141 new confirmed cases in Osaka Prefecture, 90 in Fukuoka Prefecture, and 80 in Aichi Prefecture.
Telecommunication fraud crimes increase by 70% in the first half of the year, the Supreme People's Procuratorate summarizes features - China News
July 26 (China News) According to the website of the Supreme People's Procuratorate, in the first half of this year, the procuratorial organs across the country prosecuted a total of 58,101 people for fraud crimes, a year-on-year increase of 35%.
Especially among crimes obstructing the pandemic prevention and control, there are many fraudulent crimes, accounting for 43.4% of the total number of crimes obstructing pandemic prevention and control.
The Supreme People's Procuratorate has provided targeted guidance and has now released ten batches of typical cases involving pandemic prevention and control, including a total of 9 cases of fraudulent crime.
From the cases handled by the procuratorial organs in the first half of the year, a wide range of fraudulent crimes are involved, ranging from national macro policies to people's basic necessities of life: typical cases include pandemic-related fraud, "hospital scalping”, "health care products", "enrollment agencies", "loan fraud", defrauding people of state subsidies, fraud regarding unfreezing national assets, and so on, but the new emerges out of the old constantly, and fraud involving education, medical care, employment, pensions, social security, land acquisition and relocation, targeted poverty alleviation, financial credit, and other areas has emerged, which has not only caused economic losses to the victims, but also seriously affected economic and social development.
In particular, some telecommunication fraud even crosses national boundaries or geographical and personnel restrictions, which involves victims without specific features and cause harm through cross-border, remote, and electronic payment.
For example, some set up companies in rented high-grade office buildings, providing multiple departments or positions that use legitimate online platforms for promotion, and which recruits, trains, and assesses its employees; management models of enterprise operation, cloaked in "legality", makes it even more confusing.
It is the compelling duty of the procuratorial organs to punish and prevent crime in accordance with the law, and to issue timely warnings to the public and relevant authorities.
In the judicial handling of cases, the procuratorial organs have conscientiously discharged their duties, maintained a high-handed attitude towards fraudulent crimes, and refined various law enforcement initiatives in a targeted manner to promote social governance by formulating and issuing procuratorial recommendations.
It is required for the procuratorial organs to strictly adhere to the facts, evidence, procedures, and application of the law in arresting and prosecuting swindlers; facts should be used as the basis and the law should be used as the criterion to ensure that no law is broken and no crimes can escape legal sanction.
In particular, for telecommunications fraud crimes, the central role of electronic data in the determination of facts is emphasized, and efforts should be made to build a chain of evidence that corroborates electronic data, verbal evidence, and documentary evidence.
For example, in pandemic-related fraud crime cases accepted by the Yinzhou District Procuratorate in Ningbo City, Zhejiang Province, the procuratorial organ intervened in advance and the whole process from the case occurrence to the conclusion only took five days, reflecting the attitude and determination to deal with the case quickly and strictly, and to maintain social stability.
In the review of arrests and prosecution, emphasis is placed on the prosecution of loophole crimes; until now, 733 people who were omitted from arrest and 1,113 accomplices who failed to be prosecuted previously by the public security have been taken in.
In the first half of the year, the procuratorial organs in China issued 298 procuratorial recommendations for fraud crimes to jointly prevent fraud crimes and promote deep-rooted governance.
For example, in response to the loopholes found in the telecommunications network supervision of communications enterprises, banks and intermediary organizations during the handling of cases as well as the Guangzhou Procuratorate and Dongguan Procuratorate in Guangdong Province made timely procuratorial recommendations that urged the relevant units to strengthen supervision, improve mechanisms, and help promote the construction of a long-term system.
Efforts were made to make criminals give up their takings and retrieve losses.
Procuratorial organs everywhere seized the opportunity to intervene in important links such as investigation, guided obtainment of evidence, review and prosecution, and urged the investigative organizations to actively recover illicit money together with relevant departments, meaning these departments can do a good job in recovering the illicit money and retrieving losses, and can strive to minimize the economic losses caused to the victims of fraudulent crimes.
For example, the People’s Procuratorate of Beijing Municipality handled a loan crime case involving Lin, which involved 22 properties waiting to be sealed, and in the event that the properties might be disposed of by other cases beforehand, the first "Letter of Execution Suspension" was issued and sent to the relevant court in time, suggesting that the previous court executing the sealing order should put a hold on the handling of the properties involved, which will be disposed in a unified manner after the facts of the crime are ascertained, suggesting that all efforts have been made to recover the properties and retrieve the losses of the victims.
The prosecutor reminded to the public to be very alert regarding fraud crimes, to not expect "windfalls", to not readily believe others because the product is cheap, and to guard their own "wallets".
Yina Township in Weining County, Guizhou Province: Shorter Apple Trees, Wider Poverty-Alleviation Paths-ChinaNews.com
2020-07-26 11:42:58 Source: www.ce.cn Author: Zhu Yanjing Editor: Zhu Yanjing
In the summer heat, reporters from Economic Daily-ce.cn visited Zhonghai Village in Yina Township, Weining County, Guizhou Province.
Under the blazing sun, villager Li Yuanzhong hoed in the field, and though his face burning red, he was humming a happy tune.
Thanks to its low latitude, high altitude, abundant sunlight and big day-night temperature differences, the apples produced in Weining County have high sugar content and great taste, which have given them a certain notoriety in certain areas, yet the apples don’t sell for a good price because they are small in size and spotty, which is hwy they haven’t moved beyond this region.
Yina Township used to suffer from poverty, “getting through the year with corn and potatoes”, and 10 years ago, the local poverty rate was 25.8%.
At this critical period of poverty alleviation, it is high time to change traditional growing practices and adjust the industrial structure to increase income for farmers.
After multiple visits and interviews, Chen Chao, secretary of the Party committee of Yina Township, along with the township team believe industry development can’t follow the old path.
Therefore, Yina Township brought in leading enterprises to grow apples in a modernized way.
In 2015, Hou Jianwen, Vice GM of Weining Chaoyue Agricultural Co. Ltd, came to survey Yina Township from Shaanxi and liked the local growing conditions instantly, so he started growing apple trees locally in 2016.
At first, the village called on Li Yuanzhong to convert his land to grow apple trees, but the Lis thought to themselves, “We’ve been growing apples for years and nobody in this village got rich from it. “
“All the apples come from dwarf apple trees, the trees don’t grow too tall. “
What Li Yuanzhong didn’t expect was, new methods were be adopted to grow apples this time; irrigation pipelines were laid under each apple tree, so that water and fertilizer could reach directly to the roots; when harvesting apples in the fall, tractors could drive directly into the orchard and the apples could be reached from standing on ground.
At present, the apple base is seeing high yield in produce, and as Hou Jianwen expected, the apples are selling well, especially among consumers in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and other cities.
As the apple industry expands, it brings new changes to Li Yuanzhong’s life, and though he still farms, he has new sources of income.
As Li Yuanzhong transferred over 9 mu of his land to the apple base, he can collect land transfer fees each year, he also receives dividends from the apples, and he and his wife work on the base, “80 yuan per day each, with work year round.”
Li Yuanzhong told the reporter he receives 2,800 yuan in dividends, and with the land transfer fees and work payments, his household annual income is over 80,000 yuan, “We’re better off and don’t need to worry about survival anymore.”
“We have achieved initial success, and our annual output value per mu of apple is over 15,000 yuan, which is 10 times that of corn. “
Chen Chao told the reporters, there are 20,000 mu of apples planted in Yina Township, with 6,000 mu in Zhonghai Village, covering 4,056 households and 17,200 people, among which are 2,952 people from 656 recorded poverty households; the over 6 million yuan a year issued as wages is a realization of not traveling far for work with the base at the doorstep.
With more income, Li Yuanzhong has started to realize his personal dreams.
During this Spring Festival, Li Yuanzhong bought a off-road vehicle, and now he drives to work, “We still have a dozen of mu of land, so when the apple base expands, I’ll transfer it all to them, so we’ll have even more income. “

Membrane Separation Technology Helps Resolve “Greenhouse Effect”-ChinaNews.com
Membrane Separation Technology Helps Resolve “Greenhouse Effect”
Illustration of New Mixed Matrix Membrane Fabrication Technology
Reported by Shang Rui: A few days ago, the atmospheric environment and bioenergy team of Tianjin University made major progress in “capturing carbon dioxide with the membrane separation method”, meaning they have successfully developed a new mixed matrix membrane fabrication technology which greatly improves the membrane material’s performance in capturing carbon dioxide.
The relevant research findings are published as the cover story by Greenhouse Gases: Science and Technology, an international periodical.
The greenhouse effect is a major environmental problem standing in the way of human development, while carbon dioxide is the prime culprit for the greenhouse effect.
How to effectively capture and utilize carbon dioxide emissions from human activities is the focus of attention for scientists.
The membrane separation method is a new carbon dioxide capture technology which separates carbon dioxide gas with the help of the membrane material, and it is energy-efficient and easy to use.
How to make the membrane material “take deep breathes” and improve gas separation efficiency was the hurdle of capturing carbon dioxide with the membrane separation method.
The Tianjin University research team investigated the impact of different solvents on the membrane’s performance in gas separation through innovative thinking and repeated experiments.
According to experiment results, if N-Methyl pyrrolidone is used as the fabrication solvent, the distribution of carbon nanotube in the membrane material produced is more even, making it more breathable, which effectively improves the membrane material’s gas separation performance and speed.
Fabricated with this new technology, the carbon dioxide separation performance of this mixed matrix membrane is close to the theoretical upper limit of this kind of membrane material.
“New technology has provided a new idea for capturing carbon dioxide using the membrane separation method. “
said Li Run, a team member of the atmospheric environment and bioenergy team of Tianjin University, “We hope this technology can provide support for exhaust gas treatment of coal-fired power plants and chemical enterprises in the future, because it can play a big role in fields such as greenhouse gas emission control. “
Understanding university major point deductions before choosing your preferred majors - Chinanews.com

Understanding university major point deductions before choosing your preferred majors
Each year, when we fill out our preferred majors on the NCEE (National College Entrance Examination), there are always students and parents who don’t understand the terminology involved, which can directly affect how you select your preferred majors.
This year, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing University of Science and Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing Forestry University, and Beijing University of Chemical Technology issued a joint admissions policy for 2020 which eliminates major point deductions.
What are “major point deductions”, and how do they impact your choice of major?
The three methods of major allocation
Experts say that before filling out your preferred majors, you should carefully read the school’s “Admissions Guidelines” to learn about the college’s admissions regulations, including enrollment ratios, major allocation, and so on.
Major allocation refers to the three primary methods of admitting students to particular majors, which are major priority, score priority, and major point deductions, after a student enrolls at a university.
The specific method used by a particular university will be stated clearly in the “Admissions Guidelines”.
However, some universities use balanced prioritization, and do not apply point deductions for different majors.
This means that all students who qualify for enrollment are ordered by a balanced total score, and if their score falls below enrollment requirements for their first preferred major, the university looks at whether the student qualifies for the second preferred major, and so on until the student’s final preferred major, none of which involves point deductions for any major.
“Major point deductions”, as they are called, are when universities apply one or several values calculated through a formula published in the “Admission Guidelines” to determine a student’s admission in a particular selected major; this value is called a “major point deductions”.
This refers to the point deduction that occurs between the student’s preferred major and another major, expressed by a point value, such as 3 points, 2 points, or 1 point.
Consider this example:
Xiaoming, a student, applies to University A with an NCEE score of 560 and major preferences listed in this order: Computing, International Trade, Automation, Mechanical Engineering, and E-commerce, after which University A applies major point deductions of 2, 1, 1, and 0 points.
When allocating majors, if Xiaoming meets the admission requirements for his first preferred major of Computing and the major has remaining vacancies, he is admitted to the Computing major; if he is not admitted to the Computing major, he is considered for his second preferred major of International Trade with 2 points deducted from his NCEE score, at 558, and his qualifications are considered for that major; if he again fails to qualify, 1 point is deducted (for a total of 557), and he is considered for his third preferred major; if he further fails to qualify, 1 more point is deducted (for a total of 556), and his qualifications are considered for his fourth preferred major, and if he fails to qualify this time, no points are deducted when he is considered for his fifth preferred major, and so on.
Different universities have different point deductions
As balanced major preferences become more popular, many universities have already stopped using major point deductions, but some universities still use this method, and from the “Admissions Guidelines” published by each school, we know that this year, major point deductions are applied at over 20 universities.
These include Sichuan Agricultural University, Shandong University of Science and Technology, Heilongjiang University of Chinese Medicine, Jiangsu University of Science and Technology, Jiangxi Normal University, Chengdu Medical College, Northeast Electric Power University, Jimei University, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing Tech University, Ningxia University, Shandong University of Technology, and Civil Aviation Flight University of China.
The major point deduction values applied at each of these universities are different.
Some apply the same point deductions to every major, such as Ningxia University, where an applicant can expect to find 1 point deducted for each major in the order of major preference.
Other universities use different fixed point values for different universities.
Jimei University, for example, applies a total deduction of 4 points, meaning there is a difference of 3 points between a student’s first preferred major and other preferred majors, among preferred majors after the first there is no further deduction by preference (meaning they receive equal deductions), and there is a 1 point difference between preferred majors after the first and non-preferred majors.
When reporting major preferences, students and parents must be sure to carefully read the university’s admissions policies to see if there are major point deductions, and while considering the point values, must also carefully consider their universities and majors of choice; if the university lists clear major point deductions in the Admission Guidelines, they should pay close attention to the point tiers of different majors so they can maximize their chances of admission.

Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, reported July 25th On the 25th, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government Commerce and Economic Development Bureau director Qiu Tenghua said that all APEC countries must act in unison to combat the pandemic and push for economic recovery, and that they should abide by the rights and obligations established by the WTO to avoid creating unnecessary trade barriers.
Qiu Tenghua made these statements while attending the APEC Ministers Responsible for Trade Virtual Meeting to discuss the COVID-19 epidemic held on the 25th.
At this meeting, the ministers in attendance discussed substantive plans APEC can enact to cope with the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and promote economic recovery within the region.
Qiu Tenghua said the public health and economic crisis due to the pandemic have caused a deep and unprecedented impact on society and the economy.
“We now face a two-front battle, and we must first defeat the pandemic before we can create economic recovery.
Our goal must be clear: the virus is our common enemy, and cooperation is the only way to defeat it; without it, we will fail. “
Qiu Tenghua said the series of trade restrictions in response to the COVID-19 outbreak would not help to control it.
Trade is crucial to resolving current problems, and as such, should not be viewed as a problem.
He condemned all policy measures that discriminate and differentiate, and advised that at such a critical moment, all economies keep their borders open, maintain smooth supply chain operations, and avoid implementing trade barriers or irrational trade policies.

Crowds Gather in Chengdu to See the US Consulate, and the Police Stop People from 'Looking too Happy'
China on Friday announced the shutdown of the US Consulate General in Chengdu in response to the closure of the Chinese consulate in Houston.
On Saturday, the badge of the U.S. Consulate was removed, and on Sunday, a dark-glass car drove away amid boos from passers-by.
On Sunday, many people in Chengdu gathered in front of the U.S. Consulate to take photos, and even those who had never visited the consulate came to have a look, motivated by curiosity about current events.
AFP's Chengdu reporter also visited the US consulate in Chengdu and reported that curious people were coming in droves, as well as many parents with their children walking to see the consulate and taking pictures of the building or taking selfies.
Guards swarmed around the consulate, and the police occasionally “corrected” people's behavior, seeming not to allow any transgressions: a woman was stopped just as she started singing a revolutionary song, and a guard confiscated a banner.
But residents of a nearby residential building managed to hang a giant Chinese flag on the balcony and shout pro-China slogans.
The U.S. Consulate in Chengdu opened in 1985, and covered all U.S. consular affairs in Southwest China, especially in the Tibet Autonomous Region.
AFP's Chengdu reporter said that the Chinese government's response to the US was relatively restrained: many Chinese people asked the government to close the U.S. Consulate in Hong Kong on the Internet, but officials only said that "the shutdown of the US Consulate in Chengdu is a necessary and legal response to the unreasonable behavior of the United States."
At present, in addition to Chengdu, the United States also has consulates in Guangdong, Shanghai, Shenyang, Wuhan, and Hong Kong.
Large-Scale Media Convergence Campaign "Watch Poverty Alleviation Livecast from Villages" Launches - Today's News - Hunan Daily Website - www.voc.com.cn
Hunan Daily · New Hunan Client Terminal, July 25 (reporter from this organization) On July 25, two caravans carrying 5G new media mobile cloud production and broadcasting system slowly drove out of Xuzhou, Jiangsu Province for the large-scale media convergence campaign "Watch Poverty Alleviation Livecast from Villages" sponsored by the China Media Group’s Financial Program Center.
General secretary Xi Jinping pointed out that "2020 is a year of milestone significance, because we will finish building a moderately prosperous society in all respects and realize the first centenary goal; 2020 is also a year of decisive victory for the elimination of poverty.”
The large-scale media convergence campaign "Watch Poverty Alleviation Livecast from Villages" is an important measure taken by the China Media Group’s Financial Program Center in coordination with this major theme and promote poverty alleviation.
The campaign will go into villages receiving poverty relief in more than 20 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities directly under the Central Government to discover fresh poverty relief stories, directly view the huge changes in the appearance of the villages, and show how the villagers have overcome the difficulties of survival and development and moved towards the road of prosperity.
The campaign will last more than three months.
Starting from Xuzhou, the reporter group divided and followed two routes: one is the southwest route, going through Anhui, Hubei, Jiangxi, Hunan, Guangxi, Guizhou, Sichuan, Chongqing, Yunnan, Tibet, and other places; the other is the northwest route, which goes through Henan, Shaanxi, Gansu, Qinghai, Xinjiang, Ningxia, Inner Mongolia, Shanxi, Hebei, and other places, covering a distance of more than 10 thousand kilometers.
In the format of its reports, "Watch Poverty Alleviation Livecast from Villages" uses a bold integrated style.
The economic development of the villages visited by the caravan will be broadcast on CCTV-2 of the China Media Group, CNR Business Radio, CNR China Traffic Radio, and CCTV Financial New Media.
Among them, the live TV broadcast will be mainly completed during the noon news program "World Finance" on CCTV-2 (airs 12:00-13:00 from Monday to Sunday), and the primetime news program "Economic News" on CCTV-2 will air a special program on Poverty Alleviation (airs 20:30-21:30 from Monday to Sunday).
Meanwhile, the caravan will carry out a 1-hour live broadcast of each village on the CCTV Finance App, where the audience can watch the live broadcast and participate in a lucky draw by downloading the CCTV Finance App.
In terms of technology application and studio design, "Watch Poverty Alleviation Livecast from Villages" makes a bold breakthrough, pioneering the "new media caravan in the field" model.
Each caravan is equipped with 5G new media mobile cloud production and broadcasting system, and uses 5G+4K/8K+AI technology to achieve the organic fusion of online and offline, large screen and small screen, and TV broadcasting.
They are equipped with a 3-channel studio area made of retrofitted storage containers that are 12 meters long, 2.55 meters wide and 3.98 meters high, and which have automatic hydraulic expansion structure, and can be turned upwards up to 120 degrees.
The studio area can also be automatically expanded, and come with an external expansion platform of more than 50 square meters, which matches the scene requirements of most programs.
Summer is boiling hot in Kunming’s Dongchuan District, but poverty alleviation workshops next to population relocation sites are heating up faster than the summer thermometer.
Lv Ling, Kunming Aisifu Electronics Technology Company employee, says, “Now, I walk right out of my house and right into the factory gate, I can earn money and take care of my family at the same time, and it’s all thanks to the free vocational training arranged by the Trade Union. “
A bustling scene unfolds before your eyes as you walk into the electronics component processing poverty alleviation workshop on Tongdu Street in Dongchuan District.
Lu Ling, now in her 40’s, is a single mother who supports her child and her elderly parents by herself.
When things were at their most difficult for her, the Dongchuan District Federation of Trade Unions helped her find solutions and provided all kinds of aid that was like “a glass of water in the desert”.
Since 2018, she has enjoyed housing, school, social insurance, and employment assistance from policies and assistance funding from trade unions at every level.
This year, her child graduated and found a job, and she herself found a job and gained an income after receiving vocational training, which finally helped her escape her difficult situation in late April.
According to reports, the Special Poverty Alleviation Vocational Skills Training Program organized by the Dongchuan District Party Committee is part of the Yunnan Provincial Federation of Trade Unions skills training work.
Based on the unique characteristics of poverty alleviation for the recently relocated employment-challenged in the district, the District Committee has conducted in-depth investigations to understand training requirements and determine the types of vocational training to be conducted, and in the near future plans to train a total of 450 electricians, welders, and pastry chefs.
Li Yi, an employee at the Agricultural Bank’s Yunnan Menglian County Branch, recently wrote a heartfelt letter of thanks to the County Federation of Trade Unions.
In her letter, she offered sincere thanks for the Golden Autumn Scholarship she received from the trade union from August 2013 to January 2017, which allowed her to complete her studies.
After Li Yi’s father passed away in a car accident in 2004, her mother received employment-challenged status, and has enjoyed the benefits of inclusion in the system since.
With the help of the local trade union, Li Yi successfully completed her studies.
Since 2016, systemic guarantees and targeted assistance have lifted 3,809 households out of poverty.
The successful poverty relief offered to Lv Ling’s family and Li Yi are a window into the poverty alleviation efforts for the employment-challenged of Yunnan’s trade unions.
According to Duan Kaiyuan, who works at the Yunnan Provincial Federation of Trade Unions in the Legal and Rights Protection Work Department, the Federation’s provincial headquarters has enhanced its dynamic management of the employment-challenged filing system, pushed normalize filing for assistance, and worked to actively bring those qualified for employment-challenged status into assistance systems; they have also expanded channels to apply for employment-challenged status by creating a WeChat application platform to make it easier for the employment-challenged to seek and apply for assistance on their own.
During the epidemic, seeking work outside the home has been difficult, so to help alleviate pressure on the livelihoods of the employment-challenged, the Yunnan Province Central Party Committee has arranged a total of 13 million yuan in “Delivering Comfort” aid, providing 2,000 yuan to every household in the national employment-challenged database and 1,500 yuan to every household in the provincial employment-challenged database, aid that reached a total of 6,000 employment-challenged households nationally and 1,000 employment-challenged households in the province through the special program.
At the same time, the Yunnan Province Central Party Committee, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, zhaopin.com, and other online job recruitment sites worked together to push job recruitment information to the employment-challenged, provide employment consulting and guidance, and provide other services.
