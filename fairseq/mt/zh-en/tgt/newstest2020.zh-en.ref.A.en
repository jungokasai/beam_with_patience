The United Nations International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) released a report on the 26th stating that Iran has started to use advanced centrifuges to accelerate the production of enriched uranium, further violating the nuclear agreement reached with world powers in 2015.
Summarizing foreign media reports, the IAEA report states that Iran’ s Natanz Nuclear Facility’ s advanced centrifuge is “accumulating or ready to accumulate enriched uranium”.
Since the US President Trump withdrew from the nuclear agreement in May last year and imposed sanctions on Iran, Iran has been gradually violating the restrictions on nuclear agreements reached with major powers in 2015.
The agreement stipulates that Iran can only use first-generation IR-1 centrifuges to refine uranium.
The other signatories of the agreement, Britain, China, France, Germany, and Russia, have been trying to save the agreement, but Tehran has repeatedly accused Europe of not doing enough.
On the afternoon of the 25th, local time, Japanese Foreign Minister Motegi Toshimitsu held talks with Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov in New York, where Motegi was paying a state visit, and they confirmed that they will push ahead negotiations for concluding the peace treaty covering the territorial issues of the Four Northern Islands (the disputed islands between Japan and Russia; Japan calls these islands the “Four Northern Islands”, Russia calls them the “South Kuril Islands”), as well as develop bilateral relations across a wide range of political and economic issues in the future; they also concluded that Motegi will pay a state visit to Russia as soon as possible, Kyodo News Agency reported.
This is the first time that Motegi spoke with the Russian side as the person in charge of negotiations for concluding the peace treaty after taking the post of Foreign Minister.
Motegi said to the Russian side, “We hope to pursue negotiations on bilateral issues including promotion of common economic activities across the Four Northern Islands.”
According to the Japanese government, the territorial issues were not detailed at the talks.
The Russia-Japan Summit Talks in December 2018 confirmed the policy of pushing ahead negotiations by appointing the two foreign ministers as the delegates in charge of the issue.
At the talks, the two foreign ministers also recognized the progress made in the negotiation on common economic activities in the fields of tourism and waste disposal.
Motegi expressed his hopes for the trial tourism business scheduled to be implemented in October, “I look forward to its successful implementation, so we can take the next step. ”
Moreover, the talks also confirmed that Lavrov will pay a state visit to Japan during the G20 Foreign Ministers’ Meeting in Nagoya in November.

Chinese Women’s Volleyball Team Expected to Defend the World Cup Championship in Advance!
On September 27, the Chinese team lost one round to the Dutch Women’s Volleyball Team after winning two continuous rounds, and finally defeated them with a score 3:1, thereby welcoming its ninth successive victory.
As the World Cup comes to a close, the Chinese Women’s Volleyball Team can’t ignore the Serbian Team, but the Chinese team will soon defend its championship.
In the first two rounds against the Dutch team, the Chinese Women’s Volleyball Team performed as aggressively as before, and won two rounds at 25:19 and 25:16, until encountering a setback in the third round.
As they fell behind, the Dutch Women’s Volleyball Team became more aggressive in their serves and attacked the first passer of the Chinese team, and meanwhile, the Chinese team members were only eager to attack, thereby making more and more mistakes, and finally, the Chinese team lost the round at 21:25 to their opponents.
Lang Ping said in an interview after the race, “In the third round, we lost about 8 points due to mistakes. ”
Of course, the Dutch Women’s Volleyball Team is not to be underestimated, and the Chinese Women’s Volleyball Team was prepared to meet the challenge before the match, so Lang Ping wasn’t surprised when the team lost one round, “It’s normal to win or lose a match against a powerful team, and it’s also normal to play five rounds, so we told our team members to work hard”, said Lang Ping.
In the fourth round, the team members actively adjusted their tactics: Zhang Changning attacked with full force, scoring 8 points in a single round and contributing greatly to the team’s victory.
To date, only 2 rounds in 11 of match play remain, and the Chinese Women’s Volleyball Team nearly has the championship in hand, but the race against the Dutch team has truly sounded an alarm for the Chinese Women’s Volleyball Team: the more critical the moment, the more effort should be made.
In another match on September 27, the Russian and American women’s volleyball teams played 5 rounds, and the American team failed to score 3 points from their opponents, thus, the Chinese Women’s Volleyball Team can defend its championship by one round in advance, as long as it scores three points in the match against Serbia.
All things are currently going in the Chinese Women’s Volleyball Team favor.
The six primary players of the Serbian team will be absent from the match, but this does not necessarily mean they will easily lose three points to the Chinese team.
Judging from the current league table, it is essentially impossible for the Serbian team to win the cup, which means that they will feel no stress in the match against the Chinese Women’s Volleyball Team, but they will also make every possible effort to attack the Chinese team, while the Chinese team, in contrast, will feel pressure to defend the championship, which could possibly affect its state.
Besides, the Serbian team, now consisting of backup players, is absolutely not a lamb for anyone to slaughter; in an earlier match against the Dutch team, the Serbian team played five rounds, and finally the Second Serbian Team turned the situation around and defeated the Dutch team, which was composed entirely of first line players, at 3:2, reflecting a very powerful lineup.
Before the matches at the third stage started, Lang Ping noted that neither the Dutch team nor the Serbian team was easy to handle, “The matches in Osaka will be very tough, so we should still prepare properly as usual. ”
Now, the team has sounded the call to defend the championship, and the match has entered its “white-hot stage”.
The Chinese Women’s Volleyball Team has prevailed over its rivals in both ability and lineup, but we still need to wait and see whether the members of the Chinese Women’s Volleyball Team can perform at their normal level and unleash the full extent of their powers on the court.

"For 70 years, the containment and defensive measures of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization have been based on maintaining technical advantages," Stoltenberg said in the United States Military Academy (West Point). "
He said, "But times are changing."
Stoltenberg said:” The competition we are facing is getting fiercer and fiercer.
So, we should double our efforts to ensure that no one will surpass us. "
He said, "Some new technologies were not developed by the members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, but in authoritarian countries.
Chinese companies are studying 5G networks.
Russia is developing an independent internet and investing heavily to develop the next generation of weapons, such as hypersonic missiles. "
Stoltenberg said, "The future security of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization depends on our ability to understand, accept, and apply the latest advanced technologies."
On September 24th, the "Take me on a trip with a cruise ticket" event was held in Juzizhoutou, Changsha, for which more than 100 disabled people from Changsha were invited to board the Star of Juzizhoutou cruise ship to enjoy the magnificent scenery of the Xiang River, to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the republic of China.
Most of the more than 100 disabled people who participated in the event had never boarded a cruise ship before.
56-year-old Zhao Zhengang is a physically handicapped person who rarely travels due to his inability to use his feet.
He said, "This is my first time on a cruise, I’m very excited to be able to enjoy the beautiful scenery of the Xiang River up close and feel Changsha development pulse, and I won’t ever forget this. "
Volunteers from the Changsha Fukang Social Work Service Center and the Blue Sky Rescue Team provided outstanding services for people with disabilities.
For those with severe physical disabilities, volunteers carried them on and off the cruise ship.
The relevant manager of the Fukang Social Work Service Center said that in the past 70 years, with the support of the party and the government, the cause of disabled people in Changsha has continued to develop and make progress, and more and more disabled people have truly become participants and contributors in the economy and society, while caring and helping the disabled and supporting the disabled cause have gradually become widespread social consensus.
As China is about to celebrate the 70th anniversary of its founding, the media is turning its spotlight on the heroes who we barely notice in daily life so that they dazzle under the spotlight, because they are the ones whose brilliant efforts bring us warmth and light, and improve all of our lives.
However, the heroes who walk by our side appear to be ordinary, just like you and me.
Like an old farmer strolling in the fields, Yuan Longping, who devotes himself to hybrid rice research and cultivates a high-yield hybrid rice strain to prevent nationwide starvation; or Nan Rendong, a chief scientist who strives to open China's "eyes" (the world’s largest telescope, FAST), who has concentrated on one thing throughout his entire life, and who, as he eats dry steamed buns in the mountains of Guizhou, a remote area, looks similar to the old men who have experienced the hardships of life in that small village; or Zhou Ruchang, China's leading scholar of the classic novel A Dream of Red Mansions, who was once a rural boy who received a very late education and still had an innocent heart in his old age, and though he possesses a thorough knowledge of both China and the West, he doesn’t act like a scholar at all, instead appearing to the world as a man with disheveled white hair who laughs heartily when he encounters valuable ideas; or Qin Yi, whose fame as a filmmaker is overwhelming in China, and who still frolics in the grasslands for six or seven hours a day for rehearsal despite being over 90 years old, and was willing to perform as an anonymous old maid in “Legend of the Devil Cat”.
They seek their own virtue and live a simple but persistent life, and their passion ignites as they are immersed in careers which outsiders do not understand but which they themselves cherish, regardless of high position and great wealth.
Just like the floor-sweeping monk in the Sutra Pavilion of Shaolin Temple in Jin Yong's novel - though he is exceptionally skillful in martial arts, he is neither arrogant nor vainglorious, neither happy nor sad.
Behind every "floor-sweeping monk" and every innocent heart, one can see their deep feelings of love and responsibility for the country.
The responsibility to develop our country lies not only on the shoulders of heroes, but on hundreds of millions of Chinese.
Once the words of a female middle school student were popular among netizens, "When a hero passes by, someone has to sit roadside and applaud, I don't want to be a hero, I just want to be the one who sits roadside and applauds. ”
In fact, there is no contradiction between being a hero and applauding a hero.
People who applaud by the roadside are also giving us warmth and light, because they themselves are bright-burning stars.
Ordinary people also sometimes have moments in which they become heroes, like Zou Bihua, an excellent judge in Shanghai who shouldered the important task of judicial reform.
But at the annual meeting, he asked the old master of the reception room to come on stage and tell his story, and it turned out that the master sent and received countless newspaper and letters in a whole year without a single mistake, to which Zou Bihua said, "It isn’t easy to do simple things perfectly," and then led the judges in a round of applause for this "floor-sweeping monk".
This is the kind of respect one hero pays to another.
The floor-sweeping monk has the Sutra Pavilion of Shaolin Temple; Yuan Longping has his vast experimental rice fields; Nan Rendong has FAST; Qin Yi has her stage; and Zhou Ruchang has a pulpit…it takes more than just our own efforts to become a hero, it also takes a good environment and positive incentives.
Take, for example, things like FAST, which looked at today, seem like a miracle.
In the 1990s, China's scientists were still struggling to combat difficulties, and the novelist Liu Cixin had not yet started to write The Three Body Problem.
At that time, the largest telescope was at Arecibo, a single-aperture radio telescope in a Puerto Rico valley of the United States, with a diameter of 350 meters, and was considered to be an "unsurpassed" world landmark.
The diameter of Chinese telescopes was less than 1/10 of that.
Nan Rendong, who enjoyed world-class scientific research conditions and salary in Japan, insisted on returning home with an almost crazy idea: to build a new generation of "radio telescopes" in China to receive more messages from outer space!
With so much waiting to be done in China, why would it invest money to listen to stars?
However, the motherland trusted Nan Rendong, and thus began the FAST project.
It took 12 years to select the site and another 9 years from the establishment of the project to its completion.
With a diameter of 500 meters, China’s "eyes" are now open, and that’s how China created an unprecedented second-to-none scientific project.
This is how FAST and all the scientists like Nan Rendong is amazing, as well as how China, which has foresight, stands high, and looks far, is also amazing.
With the trust of the country and the goodwill of the people, those like Nan Rendong can become pillars of our country and the courage of our people.
Young talents and white-haired heroes walk by everywhere as people applaud gently by the roadside: what a beautiful and harmonious nation!
Garbage classification introduced to kindergarten in Jilin for the first time
A kindergarten in Jilin City, Jilin Province, launched a garbage classification education class to teach children how to distinguish between recyclable garbage and other types of garbage on the 27th.
It is reported that this is the first time for garbage sorting to be introduced in local preschool education.
Nine departments in Jilin Province jointly issued the Work Plan of Promoting Garbage Classification in Prefecture-level Cities in Jilin Province.
Based on the experience of compulsory garbage classification in Changchun in 2019, the government decided to carry out it in prefectural-level cities.
Jilin City is one of them.
We hope that through this activity, children can affect their family, while the kindergarten itself can persuade all of society to take up garbage classification to protect the environment.
Said Liu Lijuan, executive head of Haifaner International Kindergarten, which held the event.
The director read out the environmental protection proposal, hoping that children would take the lead in sorting garbage.
After performing dance called "Low-carbon Baby", children were divided into groups to play garbage sorting games.
Their instructors also issued labels with words like "Recyclable Waste" and "Other Waste" to children for them to stick on the trash cans and suggested that they shoot a short video when they get home.
Liu Lijuan said the kindergarten has always advocated the concepts of low carbon and environmental protection, and that environmental protection lectures are held on a regular basis.
Sortable trash bins are also placed inside the kindergarten, which bear symbols of garbage types.
The teachers educating children about recyclable garbage, photographed by Cang Yan.
Preliminary statistics show that Jilin Province created around 5.4652 million tons of solid waste in 2018, and that all of it was processed at domestic waste plants.
3.2929 million tons were landfilled, 2.0923 million tons were incinerated, and 80,100 tons were utilized in various ways.
After years of effort, all cities and counties in the province now are capable to process domestic garbage in a non-damaging manner.
The issued document, Work Plan for Promoting Garbage Classification at the Prefecture Level in Jilin Province, requires the introduction of garbage classification on campus, in textbooks, and in classes through the creation of garbage classification songs, ballads, comics, and micro videos, as well as strengthening interaction between students and parents, which the government believes is the best way to universalize this concept, ”educating a child to influence his family, then the community, and finally the next generation".
According to data released by Mazda on September 27, global sales in August were 117015 units.
Due to the impact of insufficient launch of new models and reduction of price, sales in China dropped by 21%.
Domestic sales in Japan decreased by 6%, and the need to get on the last bus before the increase of consumption tax in October was limited.
Mazda sold 17729 vehicles in China in August.
Sales in August of 2018 also decreased by 13% from the previous year, and continued to decrease.
Sales of the CX-4, the most popular SUV in China, decreased by 14%.
It has been a long time since the "CX-4" launch in 2016, and the influence of new cars has declined.
The decrease of price reductions due to a long-term strategy to increase brand value has also been reported to have a significant impact on sales.
Mazda’s sales in the U.S. increased by 7% year-on-year to 27482, which was an improvement after 14 months.
In August, the fact that sellers had one more business day than the previous year, together with the "promotional activities such as improving publicity" (Mazda), made the sales of SUVs such as "CX-5" increase.
Domestic sales in Japan fell by 6% to 14422 units.
The company said that the urgent rush to buy before the tax increase "was not as intense as the last time (2014)."
Sales of small cars such as "Demio" decreased.
Jacques Chirac passed away, left a long-lasting political legacy
On the 26th local time, former French President Jacques Chirac died at the age of 86.
At a time when the world was undergoing great changes, much of the political legacy left by this French politician when he was in power are still worthy of our praise.
Chirac served charismatically as president of France for 12 years.
He inherited the independent diplomatic spirit of Gaullism, firmly supported European integration, and is a representative figure in the pursuit of the "European Dream".
As a politician with strategic vision, he vigorously advocated for a multipolar and multilateral world.
For this reason, the French media described him as "an outstanding representative of France on the world stage".
One of Chirac's most widely known decisions is his staunch opposition to the US-led Iraq invasion.
Under his leadership, France, together with Germany, withstood pressure from the United States and stood at the forefront of the anti-war movement.
One year after the war broke out, he predicted that the war in Iraq would aggravate terrorist activities and make the world increasingly dangerous.
Later, Chirac's warning proved to be quite correct.
Now the European integration is bowing in the midst of a raging storm, and as American unilateralism is becoming increasingly prominent, Chirac's strategic thinking and choices in international politics and global affairs is undoubtedly of enlightening significance.
Chirac is also a French politician who is familiar and well-liked by the Chinese.
He is one of the advocates of and creators of the "Golden decade" of Sino-French relations; after being elected president of France for the first time in 1995, he used his position as a politician and his strategic vision to promote the rapid development of Sino-French relations.
China and France soon established a comprehensive strategic partnership in 2004, and the bilateral exchanges between China and France entered a brand-new phase.
During his presidency, the bilateral trade volume between China and France increased rapidly, while the two nations have made spectacular breakthroughs on cooperation in aviation, nuclear energy, railway transport, and other fields.
The “Chinese Culture Year” advocated by Chirac created a novel model of cultural exchange unique in the history of China and France.
Chirac's ardent and life-long love for Chinese culture was particularly impressive.
A Chinese diplomat who knew him well said that Chirac could recite some poems written by Li Bai and Du Fu, and could even accurately judge the historical age of Chinese bronzes.
Chirac has a well-known quote: "One hasn't really been to Egypt without visiting the pyramids; one hasn't really been to China without visiting the Terracotta Warriors.”
In an exclusive interview with Xinhua News Agency, Chirac said, "The West has concerns about China's political and social development, the ecological problems which have emerged during China's economic growth, and China's political status in the international arena.
However, I myself have full confidence in China.
I regard it as a country with long history of civilization, and its experience is enough to help itself establish the concept of harmonious development and assume its own responsibility on the world stage in the long-run. ”
The renaissance of China will bring vitality and creativity to the world’s culture, as well as enrich it.

Councilors of the Establishment Camp in Hong Kong SAR Legislative Council Countersign against US’ Hong Kong-related Act
On September 27, some councilors of the Establishment Camp in Hong Kong SAR Legislative Council signed a joint declaration to voice their strong opposition against the “Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act of 2019” passed by the US Congress Committee on Foreign Affairs.
The declaration, countersigned by 40 councilors from the Establishment Camp, stresses that the rights enjoyed by Hong Kong are conferred by the Basic Law on the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, including maintaining its status as a free trade port and separate customs territory, conducting trade, cooperation, and relations development with different countries/regions worldwide under the name of “Hong Kong China”, and signing and performing bilateral and multilateral agreements.
These rights are not granted by any foreign government or legislative authority.
Hong Kong has always strictly observed international protocols, international rules, laws, and commercial ethnics, traded with different countries and regions, and participated in the cooperation covering a broad range of areas, and Hong Kong has made outstanding achievements visible to all people.
The declaration asserts that the US Congress Committee on Foreign Affairs has no need to pass related act, and the act is only a means to echo its role as a troublemaker to Hong Kong, make a tough intervention in the internal affairs of Hong Kong, and seek political chips for their agents who disturb Hong Kong in the region.
The councilors of the Establishment Camp feel deeply regretful of the US Congress’ move and strongly oppose it.
The declaration points out that Hong Kong is an important trade partner of the US and its largest source of trade surplus.
Hong Kong is a good destination for American companies do business thanks to its good legal governance, free and fair business environment, and clean society.
The passing of the act by the US Congress will further worsen China-US relations, harm both the US and China, and will not bring any benefit but only damage to the interests of both Hong Kong and the US.
The declaration notes that Hong Kong will carry out the “one country, two systems” guideline as usual and without change, will continue to enjoy the rights vested by the Basic Law, and will effectively perform its obligations.
Hong Kong will continue to make its due contributions to the international community as well as international trade and commerce, as it has in the past, does so in the present, and will do in the future.
The French National Assembly and Senate will discuss reforms to immigration policy next week, European Minutes reported on the 26th.
French President Macron recently commented with regard to this topic that France cannot “accommodate everyone”, but will strive to make a “proper accommodation”.
According to the report, Macron is attempting to find a compromise in immigration, so there will not be a sharp impact on the brewing debate.
“We hope to propose a dual-track solution in immigration policy, and find the balance between humanitarianism and efficiency,” Macron said in an interview during the General Debate of the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Macron said, “To make a proper accommodation (of immigrants), France cannot accommodate everyone.”
Macron enumerated four key points of immigration policy: granting the right of asylum to refugees who need protection as soon as possible; promoting the integration of immigrants more effectively; accommodating and protecting all immigrants entering France; re-accommodating illegal immigrants entering French more effectively.
Whether illegal immigrants should be under the protection of National Medical Assistance (AME) is a topic debated hotly by all circles.
Macron said he hoped to “evaluate” and put a certain restrictions on, but not cancel, this system.
After Macron made such comments, Le Pen, the leader of the far right “National Alliance”, tweeted that Macron indulged in empty talk.
Larcher, a member of the right-wing Republican Party and the President of the Senate, also said that the immigration policy should be discussed in a “moderate” but “realistic” manner, indirectly criticizing Macron.
Vallaud, a senator of the left-wing Socialist Party said that France should accommodate more immigrants and do it better, and criticized Macron for “manipulating” this issue.
As reported, the new version of the Asylum and Immigration Act has been enacted for a year, leading to dissension within the ruling party and failure to appease the right-wing opposition party.
In the next election in 2022, the topic of immigration policy will again become a flashpoint for the far right, and Macron needs to make a difference on this topic, despite the risk of irritating the left wing within the ruling party.
The French National Assembly will enter into a debate on immigration policy from September 30, and the Senate will debate it from October 2, said the report.
There are signs that China’s A shares are ushering in a “buy-back tide”, and many listed companies are vigorously buying back their corporate stocks.
As of the 27th, the total amount of A-share listed company buy-backs in 2019 has been over RMB 100 billion, far exceeding buy-backs in previous years and hitting an all-time record, according to statistics from Eastmoney.com, a financial data service provider.
The overall valuation of the A-share market is low this year, and by buying back at a low price, the listed companies can improve their capital usage efficiency, which also reflects their desire to actively manage market value and their abundant cash flow, which can boost investors’ confidence, said Xu Yang, the chairman of Shanghai Maikerong Information Consulting Co., Ltd.
Moreover, the continuously improving share buy-back system has also promoted listed companies to actively buy back their shares.
For instance, at the beginning of this year, the Shanghai Stock Exchange and Shenzhen Stock Exchange issued detailed rules for buying back shares, providing standards and guidelines for listed companies.
According to some media statistics, since this year, many listed companies in fields such as capital construction, real estate, IT, and electronic equipment manufacturing, have implemented overweighting and buy-back plans.
There are 6 listed companies with buy-back amounts over RMB 1 billion this year.
Out of these companies, Yili Shares is ranked first, with a buy-back amount over RMB 5 billion.
What impact will the listed companies’ buy-back have on the market?
The buy-back, on one hand, shows that the listed company is economically strong and financially healthy, and has the capacity to stabilize its share price and give investors confidence, but on the other hand, it also means that the listed company and its controlling shareholders are responsible for the company, the market, and investors, said Zhao Xijun, the deputy dean of the School of Finance, Renmin University of China, in an interview by China News Service.
The former is based on the company’s good business performance, while the latter requires the listed company and its controlling shareholders to be of high quality.
All of these are the important and fundamental elements for the capital market.
Stock buy-backs by listed companies can give investors more confidence, and support the stock price of listed companies.
The Orient Securities’ research report calculated that A-share market capital will increase up to RMB 150 billion due to buy-backs this year, based on the buy-back amounts predetermined by A-share listed companies at the beginning of the year and the average closing cost of stocks that have been bought back.
After almost 2 months, the restoration of the large mural Drawing of Miracles of Mazu in the Tianjin Temple of the Queen of Heaven, a key cultural relic under state protection, ended on the 26th, and will reopen during the National Day holiday this year.
The Drawing of Miracles of Mazu is a large traditional mural that fully reflects Mazu's life.
With the approval of the relevant departments of China, it was painted by Cai Changkui, the former curator of the Tianjin Folklore Museum (Temple of the Queen of Heaven) from 1991 to 1994.
It is understood that this mural was drawn on the south and north walls of the main hall of Temple of the Queen of Heaven with a total of 32 meters length and 2.6 meters in height; the mural is divided into upper and lower parts, and it makes use of over 30 stories, such as the birth of the queen of heaven, crossing the sea on a seat, and flying to heaven by growing feathers, as well as 358 characters to reflect life stories of Mazu.
Cai Changkui said that it has been rainy in summer and dry in winter in Tianjin in recent years, and that this kind of “wet and dry” weather caused the mural to crack, such that cracked portions cover 60% of the entire mural.
In order to protect and restore the mural of Mazu's stories, the Ancient Culture Street Management Committee in Nankai District of Tianjin and Temple of the Queen of Heaven started the restoration of the main hall and murals in the temple.
The restoration project was led by Cai Changkui and four famous Chinese painters were invited to participate.
The restoration is in line with the principle of “restoration to past condition”, however, the original mural was partially adjusted, and additional restoration was carried out on imperfections in the original mural.
During the restoration, we also made innovative attempt in color, material, ink, and other aspects.
After the restoration, the features, spirituality, spirit, and art style of the original mural were intact.
The Temple of the Queen of Heaven was built in 1326, was formerly known as Tianfei Temple, and is commonly known as Temple of the Queen; after being rebuilt many times, it is the oldest building group in Tianjin and it is also one of the earliest Mazu temples in China.
On September 25th, a grand opening ceremony was held for the Beijing Daxing International Airport.
The Beijing Daxing International Airport terminal is shaped like a “phoenix spreading its wings” and is honored as the first of the “New Seven Wonders of the World”.
Currently, Beijing Capital International Airport is overloaded with traffic having carried over 100 million passengers last year, making it the second airport in the world to handle more than 100 million passengers in a year after Atlanta’s airport in the United States.
Beijing Daxing International Airport is expected to handle 45 million passengers by 2022, with international flights accounting for 20%, and 72 million by 2025, with international flights expected to be above 30%.
So, how cool is this "new gate to the nation"?
Beijing Daxing International Airport, located between Daxing District of Beijing and Guangyang District of Langfang City, Hebei Province, with a straight-line distance of 46 kilometers from Tiananmen Square, is the largest newly built airport in the world.
The projected area of the steel roof of its terminal on the ground is 180,000 square meters, the same area of 25 standard football fields.
Beijing Daxing International Airport is the world's first terminal which has two arrival floors and two departure floors -- F1-F4, respectively, are international arrivals, domestic arrivals, domestic departures and international departures.
The two-level bridge outside the terminal connects to both the highway and the airport, F3 and F4 of the terminal -- the upper level goes to international departures, while both levels connect to domestic departures.
The first flight from Beijing Daxing International Airport initiated Beijing’s "two airports" era.
The new airport is positioned as a major international aviation hub, a new driving force for national development, and as an integrated transport hub for Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei to support the construction of the Xiongan New Area; to date, 66 airlines have expressed interest in flying from Beijing Daxing International Airport, including 20 domestic airlines and 46 airlines from Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan, and foreign countries, for which the flight schedule applications are slowly undergoing approval.
In winter and spring of 2019, Beijing Daxing International Airport is expected to open 116 routes, including 101 domestic routes and 15 international routes, which cover 112 destinations around the world, including 97 domestic destinations and 15 international destinations.
It forms an internationally competitive first-class “two-hub” airport layout alongside Beijing Capital International Airport through coordinated development and moderate competition, which not only reduces the close-to-capacity operating pressure currently felt by Beijing Capital International Airport, but also better meets the urgent need for rapid growth of air transport in Beijing and its surrounding areas, and thus enhances the international competitiveness of China's civil aviation.
To secure efficiency and quality, Beijing Daxing International Airport has fully considered its geographical location, and the relationship between the airport and the surrounding airspace and operation environment: its airport runways arranged in an "omnidirectional" layout for the first time in China, it uses the largest air traffic control system in the world, and contains the largest terminal control area in China, which maximizes aviation operational efficiency.
It’s the first time for an airport in China of such size to use automatic baggage handling and an information management system made in China, and the airport uses an innovative baggage transfer model to improve the efficiency of the baggage handling system.
The first flight from Beijing Daxing International Airport symbolizes a phoenix spreading its wings to take off.
The new airport, which has created over 40 global and national “firsts”, and which is more than 98% made in China, will certainly exert direct and indirect economic influences on the surrounding industries, and will inject the airport’s vitality into Beijing's economic development.
MCA tentatively plans to hold a conference in November, plans to lower party’s minimum age to 16
MCA tentatively plans to hold a central representative conference in early November, intending to revise the party constitution and lower the party’s minimum age to 16.
As the parliament lowered the voting age in the general election, MCA announced the 66th Central Representative Conference to be held this year, and proposed amendments to the party constitution, including lowering the minimum age of Malaysian Chinese to join the party, from the current 18 to 16.
MCA President Datuk Seri Wei Jiaxiang said that the MCA Central Committee was originally scheduled to convene a central representative conference on November 2 and 3 this year, but due to the by-election of the Tanjung Piai Parliament, the date of the conference may be changed.
He said that since the Election Committee will finalize the nomination and polling days for the Tanjung Piai Parliament by-election on October 1, and they will meet the next day, on October 2, to discuss whether to change the date of the central representative conference this year.
He also explained that the purpose of convening the Central Committee yesterday (26th) was to finalize the date of the representative conference and amend the party constitution, however, it happened to coincide with the unfortunate death of Datuk Mohammad Faree, Bersatu Tanjung Piai Parliament member, thus it has been joined with the agenda for this by-election.
Wang Boxiang, Former Party Secretary of Shouguang County in Shandong Province, Xinhuanet
Wang Boxiang was born in February 1943 in Shouguang, Shandong Province, started work in 1967, and successively served as the secretary of the township party committee, secretary of the county committee, and mayor.
In 1986, Wang Boxiang was appointed as the Party Secretary of Shouguang County in Shandong Province, and at that time, Shouguang was a poor county in Weifang.
During his five-year tenure in Shouguang, Wang Boxiang, who had a desire to serve the people, concentrated on doing three things: first, promoting vegetable industrialization; second, developing the salt marsh in the north of Shouguang; and third, laying the foundation for industry to succeed so that the people of Shouguang could fill their pockets and live with dignity.
Shouguang farmers have a tradition of growing vegetables, and also have learned lessons from the practice.
In the early 1980s, Shouguang farmers had abundant harvests of vegetables, but the vegetables could not be sold and rotted in the field.
Through research, Wang Boxiang found that the key to the vegetable industry is to improve circulation.
Shouguang took the lead in establishing a vegetable wholesale market, which was the start of its market economy development.
Party members and leaders should take the lead, because if they fail, the whole county bears the losses.
In 1989, 17 Party members, including Wang Leyi in Sanyuanzhu village, set up 17 winter-warm vegetable greenhouses with the support of Wang Boxiang, and 17 “double 10000-yuan households” emerged in the village that year.
Then the county set up a promotion group, and mobilized by Wang Boxiang, Wang Leyi carried out traveled to various villages and towns to offer guidance; in the first year, more than 5000 vegetable greenhouses were constructed, and then, like a prairie fire, the greenhouses spread to the whole county and even the whole country.
For thousands of years, 1.6 million-mu of land in the north of Shouguang has been shoals, except for a salt marsh.
Life was very hard for the local people.
The south of Shouguang had vegetable greenhouses, so what was the north of Shouguang to do?
Wang Boxiang organized tens of thousands of people to hold a general meeting and then camp at the salt marsh for 40-50 days.
Wang Boxiang and other county leaders lived and ate on the construction site, pushed carts and carried loads alongside the ordinary workers, and went through the rigors of living in the wilderness; the common people gave them a thumbs up sign when they saw them, and admired them from the bottom of their hearts, while at the same time, 150,000 mu of shrimp ponds, 200,000 mu of salt fields, and 600,000 mu of cotton fields were developed in the north of Shouguang, creating a “cornucopia” in the salt marsh.
In July 1986, Wang Boxiang participated in the Weifang Industrial Conference for the first time as a secretary of the County Committee.
During the conference, a “comparison table of industrial economic figures in 12 counties and cities in Weifang” was issued, and at first glance, the total industrial output value of Shouguang was not bad, ranking fourth.
However, if the raw salt was not counted, the pure industrial output value of Shouguang was only 119 million yuan, ranking third from the bottom.
Wang Boxiang took an experience learning group of more than 70 people and went to other places to seek new ideas.
Less than a year after returning, 150 million yuan had been invested in 77 new projects throughout the county.
After that, they organized “experience learning groups” to travel to places such as Shenzhen, Dongguan, and Shanghai to learn more.
Shouguang lacked enterprises, and even lacked entrepreneurs.
Wang Boxiang held a special meeting to resolve this problem: 40 enterprising and able people stood out from the public selection of factory directors and managers, and were promoted to the frontline of industry.
In 1991, Shouguang entered the ranks of the top 100 counties in the country, and Wang Boxiang was transferred to serve as vice mayor of Weifang.
What he left behind was more than 200,000 vegetable greenhouses, 120,000 mu of cotton fields, salt fields, and shrimp ponds, 4854 enterprises, more than 100,000 “10,000-yuan households”, and cadre teams approved of by the common people. Shouguang people still affectionately call him “our Secretary Boxiang”.
State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi hosted the China and Security Council African Member States Conference of Foreign Ministers at United Nations Headquarters in New York on September 26 local time.
African current Security Council Member States Cote d'ivoire’s Foreign Minister Tarnow, Equatorial Guinea’s Foreign Minister Oyono, and South Africa’s Foreign Minister Pandor, as well as candidate Member States Niger’s Foreign Minister Kara and Tunisia’s Foreign Minister Jessnawi attended the meeting.
Wang Yi made four suggestions on strengthening cooperation between China and Africa in the Security Council.
First, obtaining strength through unity.
The biggest challenge in the current international situation is unilateralism, and the direct consequence is that the basic norms of international relations are challenged, the role of the Unite Nations is impacted, and the interests of a large number of developing countries and middle and small countries, including African countries, are harmed.
China and Africa need to work hand in hand and side by side to meet this challenge, because only through unity can they have strength.
In the Security Council, when the three African countries speak with one voice, the focus is not just on their three votes, but the entire African continent.
When China and Africa stand together, it adds up to more than four votes, and instead leads other countries to follow up, and thereby influence and shape the Security Council agenda.
In 2018, China established the “3+1” coordination mechanism with African members of the Security Council, so we must make full use of this coordination mechanism.
Second, we must resolve disputes through negotiation.
China has always advocated the political resolution of hot-button issues, and Africa has a good tradition of negotiation, as well as the experience of successful mediation by regional and sub-regional African organizations.
For many complex problems in the Security Council agenda, especially hot-button issues in Africa, most are the legacy of colonialism, and some are directly related to external factors.
We should jointly make good use of Chapter VI of the Charter of the United Nations and give full play to the role of the United Nations in mediation, conciliation, etc.
Third, we must seek self-improvement autonomously.
African countries and people know best about Africa’s problems, and Africa has the ability and wisdom to solve its own problems.
When dealing with hot-button issues in Africa, the Security Council should pay attention to listening to and respecting the wishes of Africa, should allow regional and sub-regional organizations to play their role, and should encourage and support endogenous solutions from Africa.
China is willing to strengthen coordination with Africa and firmly promote capability building for autonomous peace operation in Africa.
Fourth, resolve root conflicts through development.
China and African countries are both developing countries, we must persist in putting economic and social development first and mutually support the development path chosen by each nation.
China is willing to closely link the joint construction of the Belt and Road Initiative with the 2063 Agenda of the African Union, the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and the development strategies of African countries to help African countries to enhance their development capabilities and eliminate the root causes of conflict.
We will jointly push the United Nations to increase investment in the development of Africa.
The Ebola epidemic outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo has restarted, and China has and will continue to fully support and provide human and material help with our power; China is also willing to coordinate its actions with African nations to mobilize the institutions such as the United Nations and the World Health Organization to expand assistance and give full play to the role of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
Multiple Departments (Including the Neonatology Department) Saved a Little Life Together.
Breathtaking!
A pregnant mother delivered her second child, a 32-week-old premature infant, in the passenger seat of their car as her husband was driving on the way to the hospital.
Fortunately, the obstetricians and neonatologists provided timely treatment, and together saved this little life.
Coincidentally, the Obstetrics Department and Neonatology Department of the Maternity and Child Healthcare Hospital in Hubei received three premature infants delivered in this matter three days in a row on the 19th, 20th and 21st, but the other two babies were both 29-week-old and delivered in the 120 emergency hotline ambulance.
Ms. Cheng, whose delivery of her second child was imminent, felt stomach pains at 7:00 am on September 19, so she packed up all maternity items and prepared to take a shower and then go to the hospital, in consideration of the fact that she was 32 weeks pregnant and her first child was also premature.
After 9:30 am, Ms. Cheng was ready, and her husband drove her from their home in Xudong to the hospital.
But unexpectedly, soon after they took to the road, the baby was delivered in the passenger seat.
20 minutes later, Ms. Cheng and her baby arrived at the Obstetrics-Gynecology Building of Maternity and Child Healthcare Hospital in Hubei.
Seeing the flustered couple and the baby, the security guard informed the Obstetrics Department immediately, and quickly , the associate chief physician, Zhang Huan, three other doctors, and the midwife Liu Yanyan grabbed the maternity package and umbilical cord tray rushed downstairs to them.
“She was sprawled in the passenger seat, with amniotic fluid and blood under her body, and next to her there was a baby boy with the umbilical cord connected. ”
Zhang Huan was informed that the baby was a 32-week-old premature infant, and as the parents had no time to cover the baby with a blanket in their rush to get there, in the cool morning of the early autumn, the baby wasn’t crying, and had a sickly pallor, limp arms, and cold legs.
Liu Yanyan rushed to treat the umbilical cord while Zhang Huan got into the cab and covered the baby with layers of sterile towels and swaddle from the maternity package, and then cleared the baby’s respiratory tract (as shown in the photo), and then, after this careful treatment, the baby was taken to the Neonatology Department on the 12th floor.
Upon being informed, the neonatal doctors and nurses rushed to the nurse station and rescued the premature baby on the spot.
The baby was black in the face and asphyxiated at times, so the doctor used tracheal intubation immediately, and in less than a minute, the baby’s heartbeat was restored, his skin turned ruddy, and the resuscitation was successful.
After admission, the 32-week-old baby was treated with an invasive ventilator, and the continued rescue effort finally allowed the baby’s breath to be steady and smooth, after which the ventilator was removed the next day.
After a week of treatment, the baby now has stable vital signs, regular breathing, and has begun to suckle.
Coincidentally, the hospital’s Obstetrics Department and Neonatology Department received three premature infants delivered on the way three days in a row on the 19th, 20th and 21st; the other two babies are both 29 weeks old and were delivered in the 120 emergency hotline ambulance, and they are now being treated in the Neonatology Department.
Sun Guoqiang, the director of the Obstetrics Department, said, “In recent years, our hospital has received many babies delivered in subways and private cars, but without proper care, both the baby and the mother will be in mortal danger.”
Mr. Sun suggested that once an expecting mother experiences stomach pains, rupture of membranes, or sees blood, she should go to the hospital immediately.
If the baby is being delivered at home or on the road, the mother should lie on the back and put a blanket under the buttocks to prevent the head of the baby hitting the floor, and the newborn baby should be kept warm and brought to the nearest hospital.

"The most beautiful unmarried princess in the world" is engaged!
According to the British "Metro News", Buckingham Palace announced on the 26th that British Princess Beatrice and Mozzi were engaged.
It is reported that Mozzi is a 34-year-old Italian billionaire, mainly engaged in real estate development.
Beatrice will marry the real estate tycoon next year (2020).
Princess Beatrice is the oldest granddaughter of Queen Elizabeth II and oldest daughter of Prince Andrew and ex-wife Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York; she ranks fifth in the order of succession to the British throne and is hailed as "the world's most beautiful unmarried princess."

Up To Three Points Per Free Throw?
On the 27th (GMT+8), the NBA Gatorade League announced the new free throw rule - one free throw will be worth one, two, or three points depending on where and when a player is fouled on the shot.
The NBA star Shaquille O’Neal has a low free throw percentage.
Under the new rule, a foul on a made shot will result in a usual free-throw shot worth one point, a foul on a missed shot in two-point range will result in one free throw worth two points, and a foul on a missed three-point shot will result in one free throw worth three points.
The rule will not apply in the last two minutes of the fourth quarter or for the entirety of any overtime period.
This rule is only an experiment in the NBA Gatorade League in the new season, but fans are more concerned about what impact it will bring on players if the new rule is enforced in NBA.
Many people think that the new rule may be good for James Harden, but bad for LeBron James, as his free throw percentage is less than impressive.
Wuhan offers subsidies of up to 20 million yuan to promote the smart transformation of industrial enterprises
As this reporter learned from the “Appreciate New China and Welcome CISM Military World Games” press conference, held by the Information Office of the Wuhan Municipal Government on the 27th, since the beginning of this year, Wuhan has accelerated smart transformation of industries, and will grant a transformation subsidy of up to 20 million yuan.
To date, demand for smart transformation has been recorded from more than 800 above-scale industrial enterprises.
Zhang Hong, deputy director of the Wuhan Economy and Information Technology Bureau, said that starting from this year, Wuhan will launch an action plan for the smart transformation of industrial enterprises, providing free consultation and diagnosis services and solutions for industrial enterprises above a certain size in need to comprehensively promote a new round of technological transformation to create advanced enterprises.
Wuhan will publicly select a number of professional diagnostic service institutions every year based on this plan, and will conduct a general demand survey for all industrial enterprises of above a certain size in Wuhan through media forums, questionnaires, door-to-door reports, etc.
So far, smart transformation requirements from more than 800 above-scale industrial enterprises has been collected, accounting for nearly 1/3 of above-scale industrial enterprises.
Five municipal diagnostic platforms have organized teams to enter enterprises in batches, which will then carry out well-targeted on-site evaluation and scheme demonstrations.
Zhang Hong said that at present, 373 smart transformation projects are being arranged and implemented, with a total planned investment of 29.76 billion yuan, and that pioneering smart workshops and smart factories are initiating such projects, such as Hongxin Communication's first 5G smart production line in central China, Motorola's leading smart mobile phone production line, Wuhan Siemens unmanned transformer factory, CASIC's first batch satellite production line, Hvsen’s world-leading smart production line for new veterinary drugs, and Oubon’s IoT smart production line.
Beyond this, Wuhan has also increased financial and fiscal support for smart transformation projects.
Industrial enterprises carrying out smart transformation will receive investment according to their actual completion, including equipment, hardware, and R&D investment, with a transformation subsidy of 8% and a maximum of 20 million yuan.
At the same time, the municipal government has proactively joined forces with the Bank of Communications, Zhejiang Commercial Bank Wuhan Branch, and other financial institutions to provide personalized financial services specifically for industrial enterprises involved in this project to alleviate their financing pressure.
Will wearing blackface pose an obstacle for Trudeau’s reelection plan?
It was Trudeau himself who dug the pit he fell into this time.
Recently, the Canadian media have exposed a number of old photos of the current Prime Minister Trudeau, in which his face was in dark make-up.
This was considered an obvious act of racial discrimination and immediately caused an uproar in Canada.
Afterward, Trudeau apologized to the public.
But it seems that the Canadians aren’t so easily placated.
Trudeau lifted a rock only to drop it on his own toes.
As pointed out by political commentator Riley, since the rise of the "anti-blackface movement" in the United States, Trudeau and the Federal Liberal Party have been accused the opposition or dissidents of their own party of such violations, repeatedly declaring that "whoever makes a mistake like this should be fired immediately".
To put it simply, it was Trudeau himself who dug the "big hole" into which he fell.
Trudeau, the son of former Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, is young and handsome, and has been extremely popular since he became involved in political circles.
Despite his lack of experience in political elections, he achieved an unexpected outcome in the 2015 Canadian federal legislative election after taking over the Federal Liberal Party, and the Federal Liberal Party won the valuable right to form a separate cabinet with more than half of the seats in the Federal House of Commons.
At that time, Trudeau espoused many enlightened political slogans, such as "ethnic and gender equality", "ecological environmental protection", "economic revitalization", and “anti-corruption”.
But the truth is, during his five years of governance, he has come to a dead end in almost all of the above-mentioned aspects and little progress has been made.
Despite the "blackface" incident, he only paid lip service to "ethnicity and gender equality", causing indigenous groups and leaders to move protest tents to the gates of Capital Hill on the 150th anniversary of Canada.
In terms of anti-corruption, Trudeau was involved in the "SNC Lavalin incident" at the end of last year.
It was exposed that SNC Lavalin, a construction and engineering company in his hometown, had engaged in favoritism and committed irregularities, and instead of punishing the offender, Trudeau breached ethics rules by pressuring the former justice minister to ensure SNC Lavalin avoided a corruption trial.
Once the matter grew in significance, Trudeau became angry with the official who disclosed the corruption case, Jody Wilson-Raybould, the Attorney General of Canada, who was the first person to disclose the fraud case and directly handled it.
Although doubts still remained in the case itself, his interference is undeniable.
Observers point out that the collapse of Trudeau's reputation after five years in power was primarily caused by his own deeds, and that now he is paying the penalty for falling to fulfill his promise and exercising loose self-discipline.
According to Canada's most authoritative Angus-Reid poll, the number of respondents who supported Trudeau has slipped from more than 60% to just over 30% since 2015, while opponents have soared from less than 30% to more than 60%.
Although other opposition parties and their party leaders have performed poorly, and a considerable number of voters are still willing to vote for the Federal Liberal Party, the voters are dismissive of the head of the ruling party.
On October 21st, when the new Canadian federal legislative election is about to begin, will Trudeau be able to reproduce his victory five years ago?
The answer may disappoint him.
The establishment of Beijing Daxing International Airport has a far-reaching and positive effect on enterprise competition, consumer experience, regional aviation integration, and the integrated development of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei area.
Beijing Daxing International Airport was officially opened on September 25.
This Beijing News reporter learned from the Beijing Municipal Development and Reform Commission that the Beijing Capital Airport is already oversaturated, and the opening of Daxing International Airport will greatly improve Beijing’s aviation service capacity.
Beijing has become the second city with two airports after Shanghai, in that similar to the model wherein Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport mainly serves domestic aviation, while Pudong Airport mainly deals with international shipping and aviation, Capital Airport and Daxing Airport will also provide differentiated services to serve domestic and international aviation in the future.
The opening of Daxing Airport is beneficial to Capital Airport from a business development perspective.
In 2018, the passenger throughput of Capital Airport exceeded 100 million, ranking first domestically, but its transport capacity is not enough to cope with the rapid growth of demand, especially the demand for international routes.
In order to better serve domestic and foreign passengers in their tourism and business trips and keep up with Beijing’s trend of internationalization, Daxing International Airport is positioned as a large hub for international flights, and it is estimated to meet the annual passenger throughput of 100 million while also offering mail transportation handling volume of 4 million tons.
Therefore, the two airports play separate roles, target different customer groups, and have sufficient market space.
From the economic perspective, Daxing Airport will obviously help to produce win-win result, ease the tense situation of Beijing’s aviation capacity, accelerate the growth of passenger and cargo throughput volume, and achieving dual-track growth for the capital’s aviation industry.
For users, the opening of Daxing International Airport gives them another option beyond Capital Airport, and also perfectly resolves problems caused by the excessive concentration of routes, such as long transit guarantee time and slow boarding speed of passengers, which may indirectly increase the stay time of aircraft and passengers at the airport and make airport operation less efficient, thus, by alleviating burdens of the Capital Airport, the new airport also improves the travel experience for passengers.
Based on media reports, we have calculated the time and cost of various transportation routes to this airport: 1) 50 minutes’ drive by taking the Jingkai Expressway directly to Daxing Airport Expressway from the South Fifth Ring Road, which will cost 40 yuan in total, with the highway tolls being 15 yuan; 2) take Daxing Airport Subway, for which the distance varies from 20 km and 30 km, and for which the ticket price is 10, 25, or 35 yuan; 3) take the Jingxiong Intercity Train, which takes only more than 20 minutes from Beijing West Railway Station to Daxing Airport Station.
On the whole, a variety of means are available for citizens to reach the Airport, and the cost and time are reasonable.
From the perspective of overall development trends, Daxing Airport is positioned as a Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei transportation hub, meaning it is positioned a little far away from Beijing, but it strengthens Beijing’s connection to Hebei and Tianjin, makes it easier for more people to travel, and is of great significance to the economic development of Hebei and Tianjin.
Passengers in Hebei and Tianjin will enjoy more international air route services provided by Daxing International Airport, which is expressed in its traffic planning.
Daxing Airport’s supporting transportation facilities are well-equipped, and beyond the new airport line from downtown Beijing to Daxing Airport, a number of highways also connect Daxing Airport with the surrounding areas.
Just like passengers in Dongguan, Foshan, Qingyuan, and other cities near Guangdong can go to Guangzhou Baiyun Airport through the Guangzhou-Foshan and Guangzhou-Shenzhen expressways, residents of Langfang and Xiongan New Area will also benefit from Daxing Airport and have access to convenient and efficient aviation services.
Therefore, the opening of Daxing International Airport is not only about extra runways and aircraft, it has far-reaching and proactive impacts on enterprise competition, consumer experience, regional aviation integration, and the integrated development of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei; it is not only related to the long-term layout and development of Beijing's logistics industry, but provides more travel options for the vast number of residents in Beijing, Tianjin, and Hebei, promotes the service quality of Beijing logistics industry, and also promotes the development process of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei integration and the economic and trade development of the areas around Daxing Airport.
So, as we take account of the opening of Daxing International Airport, we should look beyond the mere benefits to individuals and see its greater benefit to society’s overall development.

2019 Vietnam Forum on Economic and Social Issues held in Thua Thien-Hue Province
Ruan Dejian, Deputy Director of the Economic Committee of the Vietnamese Congress, revealed that at the beginning of this year, Vietnam’s economy and society presented many new improvements and continued to maintain a trend of growth.
This forum focused on the prominent economic and social issues in the first few months of 2019, and proposed measures for economic and social development by the end of 2019 and in 2020.
At the forum, the participating delegates exchanged in-depth opinions and views on 4 topics, which included economic development in 2019, the impact of some free-trade agreements, some prominent issues of the Vietnamese economy, society and culture in 2019, and predictions and suggestions for economic and social development in Vietnam in 2020.
Delegates generally believed that in the first few months of 2019, global economic growth had slowed down, and that risks and challenges had increased.
Trade frictions between major economies had further contracted global trade and investment.
According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), despite the fact that global economy is full of uncertainties, and 70% of the world ’s economies are in a state of stagnation, Vietnam’s economy has still achieved many gratifying developments, the macro economy in Vietnam has been operating smoothly, and inflation has been effectively controlled in the first half of 2019, while the consumer price index increased by an average of 2.64%, which is the lowest increase in the past three years.
In the first half of 2019, the GDP of Vietnam increased by 6.76%, and although the rate is lower than 7.05% in the same period last year, compared with the same period in the 2011-2017 period, the growth rate is still relatively high.
When making predictions about Vietnam's economic development trend from 2019 to 2020, Deng Deying, Deputy Director of the National Economic and Social Prediction Center of Vietnam, said that in the context of world economic turmoil, the Vietnamese economy in 2019 showed strong growth.
It is estimated that by 2020, Vietnam's macro economy will continue to be basically stable, the implementation of various free-trade agreements will help promote trade, but as economic restructuring and the improvement of the business environment will be further strengthened, due to the impact of trade friction, Vietnam's export activities will show a downward trend.
Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen monitoring and risk warning mechanisms, proactively seek trade remedy measures for Vietnam's export commodities, look for opportunities to expand new export markets, and create convenience for the export of various commodities such as agricultural and aquatic products.
At the same time, the inflation rate should be kept at a reasonable level to promote the development of auxiliary industries, and the development of high-tech agriculture, organic agriculture, and ecological agriculture should be supported.
Liu Zhijie, director of the Consular Office of the Chinese Embassy in Cambodia in Siem Reap, held a reception in Siem Reap on the 26th to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the Peoples Republic of China.
During the 70 years since the founding of the Peoples Republic of China, China has actively participated in international affairs, offering Chinese wisdom and Chinese solutions to improve global economic governance and common development, and thus has made important contributions to world peace and development, and has brought tangible benefits to Cambodia's economic growth, as well as people's livelihoods and well-being, said Liu Zhijie.
Liu Zhijie said that as the world's second largest economy, China is responsible for more than 30% of world economic growth, and especially thanks to China's "Belt and Road Initiative", China's local provinces and cities on one side and Siem Reap and its neighbors on the other have made substantive headway in their cooperation.
He said that this is the 61st year of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Cambodia, and that as the two countries share brotherly friendship, their mutually beneficial cooperation will become the driving force for local economic and social development.
Tea Seyha, governor of Siem Reap Province, spoke highly of China’s great achievements over the past 70 years, and congratulated both sides for accomplishments made throughout friendly cooperation between China and Cambodia.
Tea Seyha hoped that the two sides would continue to work together to promote Sino-Cambodian friendship, strengthen mutual trust and mutual benefit, and continue to improve people's living standards.
Tea Seyha said that the friendly exchanges between Siem Reap and China’s provinces and cities are noticeable, in that Siem Reap has established friendship-city relations with 28 provinces and cities in China so far, and collaboration projects including large-scale cultural tourism complexes, namely "Angkor Smile" and "Angkor Dynasty", the Siem Reap-Guangxi agricultural demonstration park, the Siem Reap new international airport project, special training courses for Siem Reap provincial government officials, scholarships for Siem Reap students studying in China, free rural clinics, construction and improvements of urban roads, as well as a public welfare project for cataract treatment called "Guang Ming Xing", have proved fruitful, and in which the people of Siem Reap have become the direct beneficiaries.
Khim Bun Song, the secretary of the Ministry of National Defense (Cambodia), the president of the Siem Reap Provincial Council, the governors of five provinces, representatives of the Siem Reap Branch of the Council of Sino-Cambodia, volunteer teachers, representatives of the Chinese Siem Reap Branch of Chamber of Commerce in Cambodia, representatives of Chinese enterprises, and diplomatic representatives of foreign nations in Siem Reap attended the reception.
Witnessing the decade of digital China in Cloud Town—Xinhuanet
If the 2009 local website forum is regarded as the starting point, the 2019 Cloud Town Conference held in Hangzhou from the 25th to the 27th has gone through a full decade.
From a visional concept to a "cloud" practice, big data and cloud computing have become one of the core technologies supporting China's economic development, social management, and public services in the past 10 years.
In the CHNT New Energy Photovoltaic Cell Workshop in Haining, Zhejiang, recently, a new “colleague” loaded with Alibaba's artificial intelligence was placed beside the quality inspector.
It works 24 hours a day, the recognition speed is more than twice that of manual checks, and the accuracy of quality inspection is stable at more than 95%.
According to the company's director, the "quality inspector" with the camera has concentrated on learning from more than 40,000 defective samples, and with the power of cloud computing behind it, it can quickly convert infrared images into binary language and sort out defective batteries.
The company is just one example of how cloud computing is helping to transform manufacturing today.
The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology issued the Guide to Promote the Cloud Implementation of Enterprises (2018-2020) in 2018, and proposed that by 2020, they will strive to achieve a noticeable increase in cloud awareness and enthusiasm for enterprises, as well as a significant increase in the proportion and depth of cloud adoption.
Alibaba Cloud founder Wang Jian said that data-centric cloud computing has built a bridge and opened the way for the digital economy where data is a key element.
At the same time, in the past 10 years, the scale of China's cloud computing industry has continued to expand.
According to the White Paper on Cloud Computing Development (2019) released by the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology in July this year, the total market size of China's cloud computing in 2018 reached 96.28 billion yuan, an increase of 39.2% over 2017.
In addition to being a key technology supporting industrial transformation and the development of digital economy, the invisible "cloud" has also imperceptibly changed urban management and social life.
In this year's Cloud Town Conference, the "city brain" presented for three consecutive years is still attracting people’s attention.
According to Alibaba Cloud, the current urban brain has become a city management hub from a traffic management tool, and related cooperation applications have been expanded to 23 cities around the world.
Through camera perception and artificial intelligence algorithms, the city brain can realize new city management service functions such as “stop and pay”, “real-time perception of visits”, and “tourist route design” through powerful computing capabilities.
In the field of government service, “One Cloud” is used to connect with “One Affair”, and “Office on Mobile” and “Service on Mobile” are jointly promoted, cloud computing has brought convenience to both ends of the government services.
At present, Zhejiang has built a unified public data platform across the province through government affairs on the cloud.
As of September 11, this platform has covered more than 57 million permanent residents and more than 15 million legal entities in the province, and collected 19.08 billion pieces of data in 3066 categories.
Zhejiang's government departments make an average of 12 million calls and share data every month, and each additional call on the cloud may mean less people running errands.
Be Cautious about Making Tea with Plastic Tea Bags!
The Central News Agency reports that the latest Canadian research has found that one plastic tea bag may release billions and even tens of billions of plastic particles, which is significantly higher than the number of plastic micro-particles a person takes in throughout the year, however, no evidence so far proves that the intake of plastic particles is a danger to humans.
According to the report, the researchers of McGill University found that after soaking in a cup of hot water that is almost boiling (95 Celsius degrees), it will release about 11.6 billion plastic particles and 3.1 billion smaller nanometer-size plastic particles in the cup.
This quantity is significantly higher than the number of plastic micro-particles a person takes in throughout the year.
Earlier research published in 2019 reveals that generally, a person consumes at least 50,000 plastic particles and aspirates the same amount of plastic particles.
In this study, which was published in the Environmental Science and Technology Journal, the researchers tested four different types of commercial plastic tea bags collected at stores and cafes in Montreal, opened the tea bags, cleaned them, soaked them in water that was almost boiling for 5 minutes, and then analyzed the particles with an electron microscope and spectrograph.
According to their research, a single tea bag can release more than 11.6 billion plastic particles, “which is higher than the plastic load of other earlier foods by several magnitudes”.
According to the report, most tea bags are made of natural fibers, but many tea bag brands which use natural fibers still seal the bags with plastics.
Some brands no longer use paper tea bags, but have turned to plastics, and it is these plastic tea bags that the researchers tested.
Plastic particles are tiny fragments of plastic, and researchers have defined the size of these plastic particles at 100 nanometers to 5 centimeters, which are produced mainly from the decomposition of plastic garbage.
Researchers have found the traces of plastic particles in the air, soil, and rivers across the world, as well as in the deepest oceanic trench, and these plastic particles also can be found in tap water, bottled water, sea foods, and beer.
In October 2018, researchers first detected plastic particles in human feces samples collected in several countries of different regions worldwide.
To test the potential toxicity of the plastic particles released from the tea bags, this Canadian research team put water fleas into polluted water and found that these plastic particles affected the behaviors of these fleas and caused them to suffer developmental malformation.
So far, there is no evidence proving that the intake of plastic particles threatens humans, says the World Health Organization (WHO).
However, the WHO points out that we should perform more research to fully understand how these plastic particles spread in the environment and how they affect people.
The researchers surmise that these tea bags release a large number of plastic particles possibly because after contact with the boiled water, these plastic bags, even “food-grade” plastic, may decompose or leach toxic substances after they are heated to above 40 Celsius degrees.
Guterres said that the climate emergency is the largest threat to the survival of small island countries.
There, natural disaster will erode their development achievements within one generation.
The disasters in Barbuda, Dominica, and the Bahamas, which have been hit by hurricanes, serve to illustrate this point.
About a quarter of people in small island developing countries live at an attitude of 5 meters or less above sea level.
Relocation may seriously affect their society and lifestyle, and may even cause problems with aspects of sovereignty and national identity.
At the Climate Action Summit on Monday, small island countries worked together to realize carbon neutral 100 percent renewable energy before 2030, becoming leaders for the world to move in the right direction again.
Guterres said, "The climate crisis is stacking new injustices over old injustices.
Although contributing little to global warming, small island developing countries have paid the highest price.
Since these countries are middle-income status, many are caught in accelerated and unsustainable cycles of disaster and debt.
The world must take action, for now is the time to make big decisions and make large investment in small island developing countries. "
Today’s high-level meeting issued a political declaration calling for seeking a method to help small island developing countries to manage their disaster risks, invest in basic facilities with climate adaptability, and transition to renewable energy, and also urged international organizations to help small island developing countries, especially debt-ridden middle-income countries, to obtain funding.
Small island developing countries are at the forefront of protecting and conserving the earth’s lifeline--the ocean.
The latest special report released by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change this week confirms that the ocean is suffering from "sweeping" serious consequences of the climate crisis.
According to this report, once-in-a-century sea level rise may occur in many regions by the middle of this century.
The report warns that some island countries are likely to become uninhabitable if significant funding is not invested in adapting to the problem.
Pollution, overfishing, and acidification have caused huge losses.
The world has lost half of its live coral in the past 150 years, and plastic pollution has been increased by 10 times in the past 40 years.
Demand from industry, shipping, mining, and tourism is leading to reduced resources, including the fish stocks necessary for maintaining many island communities.
Small island countries also faces high costs of transportation, energy, and basic facilities.
They depend heavily on certain external markets and are subjected to price fluctuation.
Some countries are struggling to deal with the security implications of illegal trafficking in persons, weapons, and drugs.
Guterres said, "If a problem can be solved in the most challenging environment, the problem can be solved anywhere.
The efforts of small island developing countries to realize the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development will provide us with tools, lessons, and examples for the world to learn from. "
He emphasized that the small island developing countries were special cases of sustainable development.
They need long-term attention and investment from the entire international community.
India’s financial system has sufficient liquidity, says its Finance Ministry.
Driven by holiday spending, India's economy is expected to grow again in the second half of the current fiscal year, as the financial system has sufficient liquidity, Finance Minister Sitharaman said on the 26th.
Sitharaman made the above statement after meeting with representatives of private banks, non-bank financial institutions, and housing banks in India.
Sitharaman did not indicate the relevance of these remarks.
Earlier, some Indian and overseas media attributed India's sustained economic slowdownto the current tight liquidity of non-bank financial institutions.
Citing the decline in auto sales, Sitharaman denied that liquidity was the main reason for the drop.
Sitharaman noted that the decline in auto sales was largely driven by cyclical factors.
And he expected growth to resume in the second half of the fiscal year, driven by holiday spending.
India's annual shopping season starts in September and runs until the end of the year.
Shopping is expected to be a big boost to India's economy.

Shinzo Abe Posted a Video to Celebrate the 70th Anniversary of the Founding of New China and Presented a Congratulation Speech in Chinese
On September 26, local time, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe posted a video to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China.
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe: Good evening, I’m Shinzo Abe.
On the occasion of the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China, I would like to, on behalf of Japanese government and people, offer my warmest congratulations.
In June, the G20 Osaka Summit was held successfully through the joint efforts of China and Japan, and the Summit also endorsed G20 Osaka Leaders’ Declaration, which declared to the world the G20’s unbreakable will.
Moreover, at the Sino-Japan Summit talks and dinner before G20 Osaka Summit, we agreed that President Xi Jinping will pay a state visit to Japan next spring, and unanimously determined to open up a new era for China and Japan.
China and Japan share a great responsibility for peace and prosperity of Asia and the world.
I firmly believe that we should cope with regional and global issues, and make contributions to the international community together, which is what will help us build a new model for Sino-Japan relations in the future.
Finally, I wish us a flourishing relationship and my friends a prosperous career.
“Over-age migrant workers on some construction sites may account for more than half.
Where can we find young workers?
Though we do not want to use so many 'old people' on the construction site, there is nothing we can do about it. ”
Zou Kui sighed, who has worked as an engineering contractor in construction industry for many years, because recently, quite a few over-age migrant workers (over the retirement age) are working on construction sites.
Recently, the university where this writer is located has been carrying out rain and pollution diversion project, which means many migrant workers work inside the campus, and if we pay attention, we notice that many of them are over-age migrant workers.
They do not work because they feel bored at home, they do so out of necessity as they save money to solve pension and medical issues, or to finance their children; these are the driving forces for these senior citizens, who should be retired and enjoy their later years.
It’s not as easy as we might think to ensure those workers be well taken care of.
Raising children, supporting the elderly, paying for their children’s education, helping the next generation build houses and buy cars, and helping them to them get married and settle down, and raising their grandchildren are the ”life tasks” for these workers, and when these migrant workers have completed their "life tasks", their pockets are empty, or they may even incur heavy debts, causing most of them have little savings.
To support their children and save more money for themselves, many migrant workers insist on "working until they can't anymore".
Younger migrant workers, like those born in the 1980’s, 1990’s, and 2000’s, are unwilling to engage in secondary industries or low-end service industries that are difficult and require heavy labor, resulting in a structural "labor shortage", which in turn means these unattractive jobs provide opportunities for over-age migrant workers.
Due to the lack of skills and the decline of physical function and working ability, a great deal of over-age migrant workers are doing jobs with heavy physical demands, low income, high risks, and few guarantees.
Behind their attitude that “every day and every cent count”, the difficulties surviving faced by these “tireless” over-age migrant workers must not be ignored or disregarded.
Their living conditions can be enhanced through guaranteeing their right to get paid, improving labor protection, reducing safety risks, and increasing labor income, because despite the fact that they "can save themselves", it is also important to have institutional protection and humanistic care from the public sector.
Some scholars have pointed out that over-age migrant workers are unlikely to be able to rely on farming in their hometowns to resolve their pension and medical problems, and that they have to find other ways to support their families.
Understanding the helpless mood and strong character of these “tireless” over-age migrant workers will help us to better understand their love and pain.
The public sector, the market, and society need to share responsibility and work together to create beneficial interactions, so that as we notice these over-age migrant workers and hear their plight, we can think of ways to ensure they genuinely are taken care of when the return to their hometowns.
Chemezov said that Russia would not export the system in the next five years, because “it must supply our army firstly, and only then can be produced for export.”
This practice fully conforms to international practice.
The main producing countries of weapons and military equipment always ensure their own defense needs before processing export orders.
Earlier, Yuri Glekhov, deputy commander in chief of VKS, said that the development of the system was about to completed.
The S-500 system was developed by the “Almaz-Antey” air-space defense Konzern.
This is next-generation air defense system, which adopts the destruction of ballistic and aerodynamic targets as its working principle.
The main function of the S-500 is to intercept medium-range ballistic missiles; the S-500 can intercept missiles within a range of 3500 kilometers.
In addition, according to some data, the S-500 can destroy hypersonic cruise missiles, aircraft, almost all types of unmanned aircraft and hypersonic missiles with speeds exceeding 5 times the speed of sound, even targets located in near space.
This weapon also can be integrated with other air defense systems, especially the S-400 system, to form a unified network, which is very important from the perspective of national defense.
Sergei Chermezov paid special attention to the S-400.
He said that there was currently great demand for the system in the world, but the Russian army also needs it, including in the Arctic region.
The S-400 air defense system was put into service for the Arctic air defense group.
According to the news on September 15, the modification of the S-400 air defense missile system by the Arctic air defense group in Novaya Zemlya has been completed.
This is not Russian militarization of the Arctic region.
The Russian Ministry of Defense said that this was entirely part of a transition process to more advanced defense tools in the northern strategic direction.
The Russian Northern Fleet News Service said, “With the transition to the new S-400 air defense system, the controllable airspace of the Arctic region is significantly increased. "
It is critical that the system is used successfully in the Far North and Arctic regions, according to the military’s assessment.
The officers and soldiers of the air defense group were trained for the new system and ready for combat duty.
S-300 long-range air defense systems were provided there previously, and one part of that systems remains at present.
The air defense system must have weapons capable of destroying various aerial targets, no matter whether the targets are flying at high speed in the outer atmosphere at high-altitude or are neglected targets close to the protected facilities.
According to public sources, the S-400 “Triumph” system developed by the “Almaz-Antey” air-space defense Konzern is designed for attacking strategic and tactical aircraft, ballistic missiles, hypersonic targets, and other air attack weapons.
The weapon can attack aerodynamic targets within the range of 400 kilometers, and can shoot down the ballistic target flying at 4.8 km/s within a range of 60 kilometers.
Russia has never concealed that it will supplement and deploy air defense forces in the Far North to ensure the airspace safety of the Northern Sea Route.
The first 12 sets of “Tor-M2DT” air defense missile systems were delivered to the Russian arctic region not long ago, and together, they were sufficient to form an air defense battalion to strengthen the air defense system in the Arctic region.
At the time, the Russian Defense Ministry said that the Arctic “Tor” army would be expanded to a complete brigade-level system in the future.
Together with the S-400 long-range systems newly deployed in Novaya Zemlya and the “Pantsir-SA” short-range system deployed in the Far North, these advanced air defense weapons form a powerful defense for Russia’s polar sky.
It will be difficult for enemy aircraft, helicopters, and unmanned aerial vehicle missiles to break through this defense.
According to the ideal of the Russian government, the flagship store will become a platform for Russian manufacturers to place goods, and thus avoiding the complicated and lengthy process of opening their own stores.
Epinduo Company, as an operator of Russian goods store, focuses on selling Russian goods in China.
Epinduo has online stores on China’s largest trading platforms such as Tmall, JD, 1688, Pinduoduo, ShouQ, and multifunctional instant messaging software Wechat, and has its own online platform Epinduo.com, as well as Russian goods retail chain stores.
The Russian Export Center, in partnership with Epinduo, will develop store market strategies and participation standards, and will screen enterprises which put products on virtual shelves.
The store plans to open at the end of this year, and to place products from at least 10 Russian manufacturers on its shelves.
Data from the Russian Export Center shows that there are up to 1 billion total monthly visits to Chinese e-commerce platform.
Meanwhile, food exports to China have been showing steady growth since 2014, exceeding 1 billion USD in 2018.
At present, Alibaba Group will also open pilot stores to sell goods from New Zealand, Malaysia, and Singapore within the global import strategic framework.
According to Alexei Kozevnikov, the new store will display goods from enterprises with a sales volume of at least 5 million rubles.
To be honest, my expectations are higher, and the sales volume of 5 million rubles is not enough.
We all know that Chinese customers have a very positive attitude towards Russian goods and regard our goods as high-quality and green products. "
Kozevnikov said that competition for Chinese consumers with strong purchasing power is fierce and intensifying.
He said, "Our goal is ambitious, because we will launch 500 enterprises through the store within three years. "
Meanwhile, the platform will put products from enterprises in the Russian Far East on its shelves.
Vyacheslav Cheglov, professor of Trade Policy Foundation Teaching and Research Section of Plekhanov University of Economics, Russia, said, "This is a political project representing the image of both sides, because the Russian Export Center is a state-owned institution rather than privately owned institution.” "
"I haven’t seen a large amount of highly competitive Russian goods on the market." "
He thought that the project would probably not be implemented, but it would help strengthen the relationship between the two countries.
According to RIA Novosti, Andrey Slepnev, President of the Russian Export Center, said during Eastern Economic Forum that product information from more than 170 Russian enterprises has been published on the largest international wholesale online platform Alibaba.com, and the products can be purchased both in China or in other countries.
Another model of cooperating with the Alibaba Group is a project to train Russian enterprises by experts from Taobao University, the first seminar of which was held in July this year.
The Russian Export Center will organize the participation of Russian enterprises in industry exhibitions and commercial projects at the second China International Import Expo in Shanghai in November this year.
A large exhibition will be held in a 1000-square-meter exhibition hall, which will be the center for holding commercial project activities, agreement signing ceremonies, and promotion conferences, as well as meeting with Chinese enterprise representatives.
Currently, about 50 applications have been received from Russian agricultural enterprises.
The Information Service of the Russian Export Center said, "In addition to agricultural exhibition stands, well will definitely hold business conferences, which will arrange direct contact among entrepreneurs. "
"This is another direction in our efforts to support enterprises and ensure to arrange dozens of special meetings for them. "
In addition, master classes, cooking contests, as well as Russian food tastings cooked by Russian famous chefs and of the "Exploring Russian Food in Shanghai Station" project will be held at the Expo.

Xinhua Commentary: Follow firmly our own path without hesitation
The white paper, China and the World in the New Era, released on September 27th, states: Over the past 70 years, China has achieved great success, and the ultimate reason is that China has found and will continue on the right path – socialism with Chinese characteristics.
It is the choice of history and the choice of the people for China to follow its own development path.
In modern times, China was reduced to poverty and weakness, as well as threatened by domestic strife and foreign aggression, and generations of people with lofty ideals have sought a path to save the country and the people.
However, "They thought it over and tried constitutional monarchy, imperial restoration, parliamentary system, a multi-party system, and a presidential system, but all failed. "
It was not until the Communist Party of China and the People’s Republic of China that the Chinese people gradually opened up the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics in practice.
The path China has taken is the path to happiness for the Chinese people, the path to rejuvenation for the Chinese nation, and the path to common development for China and other countries in the world.
Only by following the right path can China run its own affairs well, become the world's second largest economy, contribute the most to the global economic growth, and benefit the world through its own development.
As the white paper says, China’s development path conforms to reality and the requirements of the times, and will look to ever brighter prospects as time passes.
Looking back, the Chinese people know how difficult it is to find the right path; and looking around the world, the Chinese people appreciate the right path even more.
The Chinese know oranges change with their environment, and understand that what is suitable for others may not be suitable for themselves, but only what is suitable for themselves is the best.
It is with this confidence in its path and strategic determination that China has created a globally recognized miracle.
In the twists and turns of mankind’s time on earth, the "theory of the end of history" was popular in the world for a time.
Today, the success of the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics declares the end of the "theory of the end of history", the collapse of the "theory of the collapse of China " and the failure of the "theory of the failure of socialism".
China's success has boosted the confidence of developing countries that they build a prosperous country with a strong and powerful people, has expanded the methods for developing countries to modernize, and provided experience and references for countries and nations who wish to speed up development and maintain their independence to follow a path suitable for their own national conditions.
We live in a diverse and interesting world.
China has always respected the right of all countries to choose a development path suitable for their national conditions.
China doesn’t "import" foreign models, nor does it "export" the Chinese model, and China will unwaveringly follow its own path, maintain its own continuous development, strengthen governance exchanges with other countries, and make its due contributions to jointly realizing good governance.
A Foodworks supermarket owner has been slammed for the “disgraceful” sacking by text of a 66-year-old female worker after the Fair Work Commission found he dismissed her because he preferred to hire employees from Asian-speaking backgrounds.
The commission said the treatment by owner Jianbin “Eddie” Wang of Gail Ayton, who had worked at the Wagga Wagga store for more than 20 years, was “grossly unfair” and represented a breach of anti-discrimination laws.
Ms Ayton told the commission that Mr Wang, who took over the store in 2016, had been “trying to get rid of me” because she was not Chinese.
During the case, commission deputy president Peter Sams conducted an internet search and found “a number of past job ­advertisements by Mr Wang on various Chinese Australian job forums”.
These posts listed the job requirements, with one stating “Asian Lady preferred” while another said, “Asian staff preferred”.
A third post said he “more preferred overseas people (sic)”.
Mr Wang sacked Ms Ayton via text message in April this year, later claiming it was due to her ­absences from work and alleged minor cash shortages ranging from $5.10 to $30 from the cash register.
But Mr Sams said Mr Wang’s reasons for sacking Ms Ayton were weak and lacked evidence.
She had been absent for just one shift in three years and the “shortages” amounted to a few dollars.
He said Ms Ayton’s dismissal was “not, in truth, related to her conduct or performance”.
“In my view, supported by the job advertisements posted by Mr Wang, the respondent’s real ­motive for dismissing her was Mr Wang’s preference to hire staff of Asian-speaking backgrounds,’’ he said.
“Mr Wang’s conduct constituted a breach of anti-discrimination laws and/or the ­applicant’s dismissal was for an unlawful reason, pursuant to s 772(f) of the (Fair Work) Act. ”
Mr Sams said he did not consider reinstatement appropriate given the “appalling” treatment of Ms Ayton by Mr Wang.
He will consider compensation to be paid to Ms Ayton, who was employed as a casual, earning $26 an hour.
Given the potential breaches of anti-discrimination and industrial relations legislation, Mr Sams said he would send his decision and files to the commission general manager to consider whether Mr Wang’s conduct should be referred to other agencies to investigate potential state or commonwealth law breaches.
He said Ms Ayton was not given any opportunity by Mr Wang to respond to the alleged reasons for her dismissal.
“In my view, the respondent adopted a hopelessly unfair and biased process to dismiss the ­applicant, whereby Mr Wang ‘waited’ for an opportunity, which he believed would ‘justify’ terminating the employment of the ­applicant,’’ he said. ”
“He was mistaken … the ­respondent’s complete disregard in affording the applicant any natural justice when dismissing her was astounding for its brazen and appallingly perfunctory unfairness. ”
Mr Sams said while the Foodworks store was a small business “it must be bluntly said that no employer with any sense of common decency, would have effected a dismissal in the hopelessly unfair and perfunctory manner admitted to in this case. ”
He said that “it was disgraceful and grossly unfair. ”

Six people deny sale of fake Malaysian birth certificates, case to be heard by the High Court
Six men suspected of forging and selling passports, birth certificates, and identity cards, including an assistant director of the National Register of Names and a Dato-class businessman, went to court on Thursday; the district court judge approved the allegations of anti-trafficking and anti-trafficking in migrants, and the case was referred to the High Court.
Among them, the defense lawyer who originally represented the Dato-class Chinese defendant Li Zhenhua, also a member of the parliament of Jelutong, applied to the judge to withdraw from the trial on behalf of the case, that is, he would no longer be the defendant's representative lawyer, and this was approved in court.
He said that he had been criticized by political opponents for representing the defendant, and that his democratic action party was also implicated.
He emphasized that he was not afraid of any threats, but he did not want to be used by irresponsible entities to stigmatize the DAP and the Pakatan Harapan government or other Pakatan leaders, so the decision was made after careful consideration.
He also said that there was no conflict of interest between the defendant and his role as a member of Parliament, and that he was not legally prohibited from representing any of the defendants, and to date, the defendant Li Zhenhua has not been convicted.
The six defendants were charged in court on September 12 this year, and facing a number of charges against Article 26E of the Anti-Human Trafficking and Anti-Trafficking in Immigration Act and Article 466 of the Criminal Code (forged documents), they all pled not guilty, which were not approved by the court and are pending trial.

Earlier, the six defendants were arrested under the National Security Offences (Special Measures) Act 2012 (SOSMA), and thus the judge did not grant bail.
Marching Together with the Motherland - A Sketch of a Certain Parade Unit of the People's Armed Police Force
On a training field for the military parade in this golden autumn, an armed police force formation composed of officers and soldiers with an average height of 1.83m was busy rehearsing.
Their shining bayonets and singular olive green and bright red shoulder boards jointly formed an eye-catching scene.
This journalist recently visited the unit, and deeply felt the armed police officers’ and soldiers’ determination to be loyal guardians of the Party and people forever, as well as their sentiment and their pursuit of “honor first”.
“The dream illuminates a splendid life, and authors an immortal miracle in the new era...” is the song written by the formation members - “Marching Together with the Motherland”.
This song was the motto of every member of the unit.
Qi Xiaoguang, at 1.92m tall, was particularly eye-catching in the formation.
As a flag bearer of the former National Flag Guard of the People's Armed Police, he understood the honors all the more deeply.
The honor of servicemen comes from bitter, difficult training.
As the flag bearer, Qi Xiaoguang always followed high standards and rigorous requirements of training.
He practiced his posture by binding sand bags on his legs, practiced the pace by setting a chronometer, practiced the step length by covering his eyes, and practiced stability in strong winds.
He considers one scene from his career as a flag bearer to be unforgettable.
A heavy rain came all of a sudden during a flag raising ceremony, but none of the tourists who came to watch the ceremony left.
At the moment when the national flag rose, Qi Xiaoguang deeply felt the honor represented by the five-starred Red Flag on his shoulders.
In 2019, Qi Xiaoguang was selected to take part in the military parade as a pacesetter.
The motion standards for the pacesetter and the flag bearer are different.
The marching step frequencies of the flag bearer and the pacesetter have a difference of just over 20 steps, but he still had to make greater efforts in his training, according to Qi Xiaoguang.
The pacesetter is the first in the first row, and directly determines the uniformity of the entire formation.
After intensive training for the military parade began, he practiced kicking his legs every day, and finally succeeded.
During a demo, his accurate step length and pace won successive applause from his teammates.
Almost every officer and soldier in the formation feels the same as Qi Xiaoguang.
The father of soldier Zhu Xudong participated in the military parade in celebration of the 50th anniversary of the founding of the New China 20 years ago.
To follow in the steps of his father and become a formation member, he suffered one setback after another, but he never lost heart.
He said, “It is the greatest honor of my life to march across Tian’anmen Square, and accept the inspection of the Party and people as my father did, so I am willing to bear any hardship. ”
When entering the unit’s Honor Room, this journalist first saw an eight-character banner - “Elite Force Keeps the Stability of the Capital”.
Political Commissar Wang Qian from the unit said that all members come from the People's Armed Police Beijing Corps - a group that takes pride in its glorious traditions, and that has taken on many significant tasks, including the founding ceremony of the New China, past National Day celebrations, security at Party National Congresses, anti-terrorist fighting, and stability maintenance in the capital, it has produced many personal and collective heroes, and more than 50 units and individuals have received honorary titles conferred by the State Council, the Central Military Commission of the Communist Party of China, and the People’s Armed Police Force.

The main shaft of the deepest shaft in China's railways is driven to the end.
Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, September 27th (Reporter Ding Yiquan) According to the China Railway Tunnel Bureau Group Co., Ltd., China ’s longest tunnel—the main shaft of No. 1 shaft in Gaoligong Tunnel of the Da (Li) Rui (Li) Railway was successfully dug on the 27th to the end, and the well depth of 762.59 meters broke the deepest record of domestic railway shafts.
In tunnel construction, vertical shafts can play a role in improving tunnel ventilation, tapping efficiency, and ensuring construction safety.
Song Tao, chief engineer of the shaft working area in the DaRui project department of the China Railway Tunnel Bureau, said, "The successful tunneling of the main shaft of Gaoligong Tunnel No. 1 to the end will help to promote the construction of the vehicle yard at the bottom of the construction well, open multiple working faces for later construction and the horizontal guide, and will speed up the construction progress of the whole Gaoligong Tunnel. "
Song Tao explained that the drilling method for the construction of the No. 1 shaft of the Gaoligong Tunnel used a large-scale drilling derrick, a drilling stable car, a drilling winch, an integral mobile metal formwork, an FJD-6A umbrella drill, and a central rotary rock grab, so specialized machinery has formed a "four-in-one" mechanized assembly line such as a mechanized excavation system, lifting system, suspension system, and winch hoisting system, realizing the mechanization of the entire process of drilling, blasting, excavation, formwork installation, and concrete pouring operation, which greatly accelerated the construction schedule.
It is learned that the DaRui Railway runs from Dali in the east to Ruili in the west and has a total length of about 331 kilometers and a design speed of 140 kilometers per hour.
The Gaoligong Tunnel is 34.538 kilometers long and is the longest tunnel of China's railway.
The TV series “Hunting” reproduces the demeanor of front-line police detectives
The criminal investigation TV series “Hunting”, which covers the transnational pursuit of fugitives, was recently filmed at Tianjin Airport, in which actors such as Wang Kai, Wang Ou, and others performed key scenes such as escorting fugitive economic suspects back to China, and the production of which was supported by China Southern Airlines.
The “Hunting” crew filmed the key scene at the airport that best demonstrates the achievements of “Hunting Action” - members of the Hunting team brought fugitives back to China, escorted them off the plane, and signed arrest warrants.
The crew took shots of the tarmac, crossing points, aircraft cabins, and hatch doors, recreating the arduous journey and professional demeanor of China's front-line economic police detectives and hunting heroes who cross over many nations to arrest fugitive criminals.
To complete shooting, the creative team did a lot of early preparatory work and repeatedly confirmed every detail to ensure that the most authentic and striking visual effects could finally be achieved.
It is reported that the TV series will also be filmed in many places abroad.
Vietnam should seize the opportunity for the development of artificial intelligence.
The four criteria used to evaluate and rank the level of cities' readiness for the AI wave include prospects, realization ability, asset base, and development direction.
Singapore ranks first, followed by cities in the United Kingdom, the United States, France, Sweden, the Netherlands, Germany, and Australia.
Oliver Wyman, an organization expert, responded to the reporter's interview for Maxine Pewana, "When reviewing and evaluating cities such as Ha Noi and Ho Chi Minh in Vietnam, I found it meaningful.
In general, I believe that Vietnam's future is very bright in light of its high growth rates, strong economic development strategy, and rapid talent building.
I think Vietnam is on the right path and doing a good job.
It is important that Vietnam knows how to use the opportunities brought about by the Fourth Industrial Revolution to promote more economic development. "
Artificial intelligence is completely changing the way people work, communicate, and live.
It brings greater efficiency, but it also generates the threat of exacerbating social, economic, and technological inequality.
However, according to a global study organized by Oliver Wyman, only any city in the world today is ready for the breakthrough brought about by the era of artificial intelligence.

The approximately 800 million tourist trips during the National Day holiday reflects booming demand and supply in Chinese tourism industry
There will be approximate 800 million tourist trips taken in the upcoming “National Day” golden week.
Big data from a number of tourism platforms shows that China's tourism consumption market is booming in terms of both supply and demand.
Ctrip’s National Day tourism report predicts that, based on previous National Day tourism statistics, it is expected that the number of domestic tourist trips during the National Day holidays this year will be close to 800 million, and the number of overseas tourist trips will exceed 7.5 million.
Currently, tourists from more than 500 cities have booked package tours, self-guided tours, customized tours, local entertainment, and other products through the platform in 100 countries and regions.
According to the estimate of the China Tourism Academy, the country received 726 million domestic tourist trips during the National Day holidays last year, a year-on-year increase of 9.43%.
This year’s National Day holiday will not only see a new high in the number of tourists, but also witness consumption upgrade as the "theme" of trips taken.
Ctrip’s report says that the average cost of domestic cross-provincial trips during the National Day holidays is more than RMB 3,000 yuan per person, up from the same period last year, which is because tourists generally choose products with a better user experience, such as higher-rated brand hotels, no-shopping tours, customized small group tours, exclusive vehicles, and exclusive guides.
Booking data from lvmama.com shows a similar trend: "private tours" of less than 10 people in comfortable vehicles for the whole journey for long-distance trips are more popular this year than in previous years.
Data of springtour.com shows that its consumers prefer "leisurely and slow travel" focused on experience, service, and differentiation.
Fliggy’s data indicates the number of tourist bookings in China's fourth-tier cities and below has grown fastest, with a year-on-year growth rate of 30%, reflecting the upgrading of residents' consumption in more regions in China.
Personalization is a major feature of this year's "National Day" golden week tourism.
Ctrip’s data reveal that the vehicle rental road trip orders during the National Day holidays are expected to increase by nearly 60% year on year, and as short-distance self-driving travels to explore surrounding niche routes continue to be touted, those ordering private tours will increase by 155% year on year.
To share happiness has become the main purpose of travel and leisure.
According to Ctrip, 28% of tourists during the National Day holidays are parents and children, 25% are couples, and 23% are colleagues and friends.
As for the age of tourists, those born in the 1980s and 1990s account for more than half of the total.
It is worth noting that even though outbound tourism grew faster in previous golden weeks, this year's inbound tourism market performance is more "eye-catching".
According to Fliggy’s data, the number of people booking inbound cultural and tourism routes during the National Day holidays this year has increased by 42% compared with the same period last year, growing faster than outbound tourism.
An industry analysis shows that while demand is high, the reform of the tourism supply side all over the country provides tourists with more abundant "grand cultural and tourism banquets".
For example, the General Administration of Sport and the Ministry of Culture and Tourism have jointly released the "2019 National Day Golden Week Quality Routes for Sports Tourism", the ongoing 2019 Shanghai Tourism Festival has launched 100 cultural and tourism activities in 7 sectors to attract Chinese and foreign tourists, and as the golden week approaches, Henan, Zhejiang, Hunan, Shandong, and other provinces have reduced the price or exempt tickets to their scenic spots.
Ctrip’s booking data shows that destinations with unique natural scenery or cultural features in China are the most popular, and that Chongqing, Wuhan, Hangzhou, Xi 'an, Chengdu, Guangzhou, Beijing, Shanghai, Nanjing, and Tianjin will be the most popular domestic destinations.

The world's oldest hairdresser dies at 108, has cut hair for 96 years
Anthony Mancinelli, the world's oldest hairdresser in New York, USA, certified by King ’s World Records as 108 years old, has never retired, and diligently cut his guests’ hair every day, however, he died of mandibular cancer complications and bid farewell to his 96-year life of hair cutting.
According to CNN, Mancinelli immigrated to the United States when he was 8 years old; and it didn't take long for him to get a job to help cleaning the floor in a barber’ s shop, and then, when he was 12 years old, he picked up his scissors to serve guests to reduce the financial pressure on his family.

Listed company repurchase scale hits record high of over 100 billion yuan during the year—Xinhuanet
In order to stabilize company stock price and maintain the company's image, listed companies have frequently repurchased shares in the past two years; through directional repo, collective bidding, and other means, companies hope to send the message that the company's value is underestimated to the market, thereby stabilizing the stock price and enhancing investor confidence.
Data from Oriental Fortune Choice shows that the funds used by listed companies to repurchase shares were 7.9 billion yuan in 2017, and soared to 51 billion yuan in 2018, and since 2019, the total amount of A-share listed companies' repurchase implementation has exceeded 100 billion yuan, setting a new record for the amount of funds for A-share repurchases, and far exceeding previous years.
From the perspective of the purpose of repurchasing, the repurchased shares of companies and the increase in major shareholders seem to be the same, but there are great differences in implementation, capital sources, repurchase purposes, and stock equity.
Xu Yang, chairman of Shanghai Maikerong Information Consulting Co., Ltd., said in an interview with Securities Daily that the Opinions on Supporting Listed Companies to Repurchase Shares, issued in November 2018, has repaired the problems with the previously existing system, such as the narrow scope of share repurchases, complicated decision-making procedures, and inadequate inventory systems, and stated that because listed companies have been encouraged to repurchase shares through policy, the phenomenon of repurchasing shares increased significantly that year.
In January of this year, the Shanghai Stock Exchange and the Shenzhen Stock Exchange formally issued the Implementation Rules for Listed Companies Repurchasing Shares, the introduction of which has broadened the sources of repurchase funds of listed companies, appropriately simplified implementation procedures, guided and improved governance arrangements, and encouraged all kinds of listed companies to implement equity incentives or employee stock ownership plans.
After the publication of the regulation, share repurchasing by listed companies is applicable in more situations, the repurchase process is simpler, and there is greater enthusiasm for share repurchases.
Buying back shares at a relatively low position is also beneficial to improve the efficiency of capital use for listed companies, so as to increase the level of earnings per share, improve the return on equity, and reduce the pressure on the profitability index of the companies.
Compared with the shareholding increase of major shareholders, it is more meaningful for listed companies to buy back shares, and it also reflects the willingness to conduct active market value management and the abundant cash flow of listed companies.
Xu Yang believes that the main factor in buybacks by the listed companies is the undervaluation of share prices; the share price of companies doesn’t reflect the companies’ future development prospects, so such companies deserve investors' attention, but can’t be invested in blindly, meaning that it is required to focus on the financial reports and the specific operating conditions of such listed companies.
Listed companies with massive buybacks at least show the development confidence and capital strength of the companies.
The buyback enthusiasm of A-share listed companies is heating up, which is normalizing buybacks; data shows that there are nearly a thousand listed companies that have implemented share buybacks this year, and the leading companies in all walks of life have become the main force in the repurchase market.
In the process of its recent disclosure on buyback progress, Ping An stated that the company has already bought back 57.59 million A-shares, accounting for 0.315% of the company's total capital stock by centralized bidding transactions, with RMB 5 billion of total funds paid (excluding transaction costs); the repurchased shares will all be used for the Employee Stock Ownership Plan, including but not limited to the long-term service plan that has been reviewed and approved by the general meeting of shareholders.
Inner Mongolia Yili Industrial Group has paid RMB 5.792 billion for share repurchases, and recently adjusted the use of repurchased share, which will be changed from the original plan, “all repurchased shares will be used as the stock source for implementation of stock equity incentive in the future” to “it is to repurchase 183 million shares in total, of which 152 million shares can be used as the stock source for implementation of stock equity incentive, and the remaining 30.49 million shares can be used for writing off to reduce registered capital”.
Inner Mongolia Yili Industrial Group expressed that writing off part of the repurchased shares would be in favor of further increasing the level of earnings per share and effectively improving the return on investment for company shareholders.
The notice on repurchase progress issued by the TCL Group on September 25 showed that TCL Group had repurchased 3.59% of the shares of the company in total, at a total cost of RMB 1.65 billion.
The office of the board of the TCL Group told the reporters of Securities Daily that repurchased shares would be used for the Employee Stock Ownership Plan, equity incentives, or converting corporate bonds issued by listed companies that can be converted into stocks.
The TCL Group has insisted on its existing business strategy, continuously improved its competitiveness, and developed steadily and healthily.
On the basis of confidence in the company’s future development and the maintenance of investor interests, the company plans to repurchase shares of the company using its own funds, self-raised funds, and other means of financing, combined with the performance of the secondary market of the company's shares over the past year, and taking the business condition and financial condition of the company and other factors into consideration.
Yang Delong, chief economist of First Seafront Fund, said that on one hand, listed companies buying back shares could reduce the number of shares circulating in the market and increase the earnings per share of the listed companies, which would be an important factor in favor of the stock price in the secondary market; on the other hand, the listed companies were willing to put up money proactively to repurchase the shares from the stock market for writing off, which greatly boosted market confidence.
The repurchase of domestic listed companies has been increasing in recent years, especially among blue chips, and it is both a good way to boost investor confidence by repurchasing shares and a practice worthy of affirmation and encouragement.
Hu Henghua, member of the Standing Committee of the Hunan Provincial Party Committee and Secretary of the Changsha Municipal Party Committee, and the four leaders of construction machinery manufacturing in Hunan Province - Zhan Chunxin, Liang Wengen, He Qinghua, and Liu Feixiang, around the theme "Changsha changes from construction machinery to intelligent manufacturing", have established a “small goal” - build the construction machinery industry cluster to a globally leading level within 3-5 years.
To build a globally leading construction machinery industry cluster in Changsha is, in modern terms, to build an "invincible industry".
As an inland provincial capital city, what gives Changsha the courage to declare such ambitions?
It comes from domineering and abundant strength.
The four Hunan construction machinery enterprises participating in the dialogue are powerful companies whose business covers all fields of sky, earth, sea and land; for example, the light aircraft of Sunward Intelligent, the concrete delivery pump of Zoomlion Heavy Industry, the all-terrain crane of Sany Heavy Industry, and the tunnel shield machine of Railway Construction Heavy Industry, provide "hard power" that are preeminent and unparalleled in the world.
There was a time when China had little say in the field of construction machinery.
But there have been rapid changes over time, and by adhering to the dual strategies of “bring in” and “go out”, alongside the drive provided by the One Belt and One Road Initiative, and by carrying out acquisitions, mergers, plant establishment, and other actions at the same time, Chinese enterprises have become leaders in the global construction machinery industry.
Among them, the output value, market share, sales and other major economic indicators of companies like Sany Heavy Industry, Zoomlion Heavy Industry, Railway Construction Heavy Industry, Sunward Intelligent, and other leading construction machinery enterprises have been significantly ahead of similar enterprises.
This relies on the ability to seize opportunities.
The four leading Hunan construction machinery enterprises are the best in the construction machinery industry cluster in Changsha, and also leaders in the global construction machinery industry.
In the global industrial environment, whoever survives and operates well, has the authority to speak confidently.
In the early years, the global construction machinery industry suffered a bitter winter, and many internationally renowned construction machinery manufacturing enterprises collapsed, but the construction machinery manufacturing enterprises in Changsha went for “winter swim” instead of trying to escape the winter; they pressured themselves, achieved original breakthroughs, and have transitioned from manufacturing to smart manufacturing through the transformation of industrial structure, and so have not only survived, but also become more robust.
This is all thanks to the joint effort of governments and enterprises.
To develop competitive industries requires both enterprises to be aggressive and the government to be proactive.
Changsha has gained the reputation of "the capital of construction machinery" because it has converged the whole industrial chain, both upstream and downstream, created many correlative industrial clusters, and lowered the costs of research, development, manufacturing, and sales for enterprises by optimizing the business environment, improving supporting services, simplifying the approval process, and taking other measures to streamline administration, delegate powers, strengthen regulation, and improve services.
This good business environment has attracted a large number of construction machinery manufacturing enterprises.
The tide of history has propelled Changsha to the forefront of building the world's leading level of construction machinery, and it is time to act and to make every effort to move ahead.
Whether government, enterprises, or even relevant linked fields including industry, universities, research, and business, all should seize and take advantage of the opportunity, keep firm objectives, strive persistently, and contribute Hunan‘s efforts to the building of a manufacturing powerhouse.
Wang Yi Presided over the Foreign Ministers' Meeting between China and African Members of the United Nations Security Council.
Wang Yi expressed that China and African countries are good brothers and partners.
China has always stood firmly with its African brothers, in the past as it does in the present and will in the future.
We advocate the holding of this Foreign Ministers' Meeting as a specific measure for implementing the important consensus reached by President Xi Jinping and the leaders of African countries at the Beijing Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation in September of last year for enhancing solidarity and cooperation between China and African countries at the Security Council and for pushing the international community to provide better support to Africa to achieve peace and development.
Wang Yi said that Africa is China’s most important and most trusted partner.
As a permanent member of the UN Security Council, China’s vote on the Security Council has always belonged to the world’s many developing countries, including African countries.
Faced with the new situation, China is ready to work with African countries on the Security Council to strengthen solidarity and coordination and to safeguard common interests.
The two sides should grow strong through solidarity, resolve disputes through consultation, be self-reliant, and consider development to be the fundamental solution to problems.
The foreign ministers of the African countries who attended the meeting extended their congratulations on the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
They said that Africa-China relations are based on equality and mutual respect, and that Africa and China have always been each other's most reliable partners.
Africa appreciates that China, as a permanent member of the UN Security Council, has played an important and positive role in African affairs, effectively promoted the fair and reasonable settlement of African issues, and made great contributions to safeguarding African interests and boosting peace and security in Africa.
At present, Africa faces the threat of terrorism and extremism, and only by addressing these security issues can Africa truly achieve long-term peaceful development.
They expected to further coordinate with China and strengthen solidarity and cooperation on the Security Council.
Wang said that an important consensus was reached at the meeting.
All parties were supportive of safeguarding multilateralism, strengthening the authority and role of the United Nations, upholding the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, and opposing unilateralism and bullying; all agreed to enhance mutual support and cooperation between China and Africa in UN and Security Council affairs, and to safeguard the common interests of China, Africa, and other developing countries; furthermore, it was supported by all that African countries should resolve African issues in the African way, and that the UN should provide financial support for independent peace operations in Africa; the concept of “cooperation for development and development for peace” was also supported by all, which will help African countries achieve independent and sustainable development, and all parties at the meeting were firmly committed to safeguarding the legitimate rights and interests of developing countries, as well as opposing any country creating obstacles for developing countries or depriving them of the right to development.
Qingyang, Gansu Province: Hu sheep provided “experience of eliminating poverty”.
The beauty of September in autumn is draped over the loess plateau.
In the Yimin Breeding Specialized Cooperative in Yima Town, after filling up the food trough in the sheepfold with the last shovelful of forage, Xia Weili, a 58 year old villager, stayed by the trough and watched the white Hu sheep chew carefully.
“Only when Hu sheep eat more forage, when they get fat in autumn and winter, do they sell at a good price. "
Xia Weili said he feeds the sheep “a special nutritious meal” every day, cleans and disinfects regularly, and served them carefully without neglect.
Xia Weili has raised sheep for over 20 years, but it was not until he came to work in the cooperative that he knew how extensive sheep herding used to be.
Xia Weili is from Xialaochi Village, Yima Town, Qingcheng County, Qingyang City, Gansu Province.
His neighbors were all sheep farmers, but they stuck to traditional free-range breeding, so the quality of sheep was poor, and slaughter capacity was low.
Under government guidance, 140 households in poverty in the village joined the cooperative this June, and then everything began to change.
Xia Weili delved into breeding all day long, because he had a belief in his heart.
The people who became shareholders were all poor households, and the sheep were all in trust to the cooperative, so everyone was counting on to deliver good dividends and sell the sheep at a good price.
Thanks to the guidance of technicians, he gradually learned how to carry out epidemic prevention, mastered scientific feeding, and became one of the few “skilled hands” in feeding in the village.
The Yimin Breeding Specialized Cooperative is a standardized cooperative with a total of 16 sheep sheds and nearly 1400 Hu sheep.
Zou Tao, the head of the cooperative, said that there were things to keep in mind both inside and outside the standardized sheep sheds.
“The wool is so thick that it easily breeds bacteria, so Hu sheep can't stay in hot, dark, and damp places, which means sheep sheds must be built in a place surrounded on three sides by ditches, and ventilators also had to be installed for ventilation and heat dissipation. "
Zou Tao said that in order to carry out epidemic prevention, the sheep sheds need to be regularly disinfected by spraying, and that the sheep should be vaccinated three to four times a quarter.
Besides living well, “little sheep” not only need to eat forage mixed with silage corn, wheat straw, alfalfa, and other plants, but also need a wide enough “playground” to stretch their muscles and bones.
The cooperative uses trusteeship to guide local farmers in raising, managing, and uniformly selling well-bred Hu-sheep here, so as to achieve the breeding of improved varieties, scientific handling, standardization, and intensification.
At present, the 140 poor households with shares in the sheep can gain over RMB 6,000 per household every year, among which 4 registered and filed farmers in poverty work in the cooperative.
From “grazing all over the mountain” to “feeding accurately”, from “mating locally” to “artificial insemination”, from “observing body shape and touching bellies” to “doing B-mode ultrasound one by one”…in Qingyang, Gansu Province, mutton sheep breeding not only changes feeding patterns, the mode of “leading enterprise + cooperative + farmer” has also changed the former condition of “breeding sheep on the hillside and selling them in the market”, overcome the weakness, small size and scattered nature of traditional agriculture and animal husbandry, meaning the impoverished condition of these farmers is improving because of modern sheep breeding.
Zou Tao said that if the market price is weak, Gansu Zhongsheng Agriculture and Animal Husbandry Development Co., Ltd., a local leading enterprise, feels confident in purchasing the sheep at a guaranteed market price of RMB 27 per kilogram to help farmers absorb market risks.
Xu Jianfeng, General Counsel of Gansu Zhongsheng Agriculture and Animal Husbandry Development Co., Ltd., said that the enterprise has driven more and more poor households to practice “sheep breeding” by providing poor households with services such as loan guarantees, supplying breeding sheep, breeding against order, quotation and purchase, and processing and uniform sales.
In Qingyang, at least 8,200 poor families have achieved stable income increases by “joining in” forage farming, stock breeding, large-scale breeding, slaughter segmentation, and marketing thanks to Zhongsheng Agriculture and Animal Husbandry Development Co., Ltd.
Qingyang City is located in the northern farming pastoral ecozone, and has rich forage resources.
At present, there are 913 large-scale mutton sheep farms and cooperatives in the city, with over 5 million mutton sheep raised, and two processing lines with the capacity to slaughter 1.3 million sheep have been built, so sheep are becoming the “leader” of industry poverty alleviation in the area.
The French Finance Minister said the tax reduction would exceed 10 billion euros in the next year and called on Germany to follow up.
Reuters in Paris on September 26 -- French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said on Thursday that France will cut taxes by more than 10 billion euros (10.9 billion USD) next year and said that Germany should keep pace with French fiscal stimulus to revive a floundering economy.
When introducing France’s 2020 budget, Bruno Le Maire said that the latest monetary easing measures of the European Central Bank have created an opportunity for those member governments with sufficient finances to increase investment.
The European Central Bank cut interest rates to a record low on September 12 and plans to restart bond purchases to reduce borrowing cost, thus hoping to stimulate economic recovery and push up the inflation rate.
“Low interest rates will not make Europe prosperous, and monetary policy measures are necessary, but not enough,” Bruno Le Maire told reporters.
“Germany needs investment and needs it now, the sooner the better. Don’t wait until the situation gets worse,” he added.
He has made this appeal to Germany many times.
France has implemented a tax reduction of more than 10 billion euros this year, which has greatly boosted France’s economic growth.
The global economy has lost momentum, and the Germany economy, which depends on exports, has borne the brunt.
Bruno Le Maire indicated that the tax burden on French families will be reduced by 9.3 billion euros next year, including deductions from income taxes of 5 billion euros.
In addition, with the gradual implementation of reducing the corporate tax rate from 33.3 percent to 25 percent, the tax burden on enterprises will be reduced by nearly 1 billion euros.

Research: US national healthy eating index increases slightly but challenges remain - http://www.chinanews.com/
www.chinanews.com, September 27 According to www.uschinapress.com, the latest research in the United States reveals a moderate increase in the US government's healthy eating index over the past 16 years, from 56 to 58.
However, on a scale of 100, there is not much to celebrate.
Americans still face "significant challenges" in their diet.
Dr. Fangfang Zhang, a nutrition researcher at Tufts University in Massachusetts, and one of the authors of the report, said Americans still eat too much food that could lead to heart disease, diabetes, obesity, and the other most common diseases among Americans.
The research was published on September 24th in the Journal of the American Medical Association.
It was based on health surveys of 44,000 adults by the U.S. government between 1999 and 2016.
The authors wrote, "Despite the considerable improvements, significant challenges remain in our diets."
The challenges include getting Americans to limit snacks, hot dogs, beef fat, butter, and other foods that contain saturated fat.
The research found that daily intake of unhealthy fat increased from 11.5% to 12%, exceeding the recommended limit of 10%.
The biggest improvement in the American diet was reduction in sugar intake from 16% to about 14%, but it’s still too high.
The authorities say the daily intake of added sugar should be less than 10%.
The researchers thought the reason for the decrease in sugar intake is drinking less sweetened soda, but Dr. Zhang emphasized that sugar is often also added to foods that are not very sweet, such as yogurt and ketchup.
American adults ate slightly more fruits, nuts, oats, and other whole grain foods.
However, the data in 2016 shows that these foods still made up less than 5% of the American diet.
Although people ate slightly less salt and drank less fruit juice, resulting in the intake of low quality carbohydrate, Dr. Zhang said these still accounted for up to 42% of daily calories, and much came from processed white bread and other refined grains.
The research is based on personal health surveys once every two years that ask adults to recall what they ate in the past 24 hours.
The health surveys have put up the question twice every few days since 2003.
The government's Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend "healthy eating patterns" to reduce the risk of chronic diseases.
The Guidelines say people should eat more nutrient-dense foods such as vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and low-fat dairy products, as well as seafood, lean meat, poultry, eggs, and seeds that provide protein.
During the research period, the number of Americans with diabetes has nearly doubled to more than 7%, and the obesity rate has increased over the years of the research - about 70% of American adults are now overweight or obese.
Moreover, heart disease is still the leading cause of death in the United States.
EU promotes strategic partnership with Asia
Ruan Wenping, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Vietnam, secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee, and minister of the Central Ministry of Economic Affairs led a delegation to attend the forum.
According to the close cooperative relationship between the EU and its partners in the Asia-Pacific region, the forum set the theme as "The EU and Asia establish cooperation: building a bridge for a sustainable future".
The forum was held one year after the implementation of the cooperation strategy of the European Union between the two continents.
President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker said that enhanced cooperation was part of the above-mentioned proposition because it benefitted the peoples and economies of the countries concerned.
The above-mentioned relationship helped bring stability and prosperity to all parties concerned.
He also believes that the EU wants to convey a message about increasing participation and consolidating the mutually beneficial relationship between Europe and Asia.
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is a special guest of the forum and will deliver an important speech at the plenary session.
China's first joint-stock bank financial management subsidiary established: empowering the asset management business with technology
On the 26th, Everbright Financial Co., LTD., a wholly-owned subsidiary of China Everbright Bank, was formally established in Qingdao, and is the first joint-stock bank financial management subsidiary established in China.
Experts said that asset management is an important area for the development of financial technology, and the establishment of financial management subsidiaries by banks is conducive to the use of technology to enhance the asset management business.
In April this year, China Everbright Bank and China Merchants Bank respectively issued announcements that they had been approved by the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission to establish a financial management subsidiary.
On September 24, China Everbright Bank announced that China Everbright Financial Management was officially approved for the business.
In the next two days, China Everbright Bank led many joint-stock banks and took the lead in establishing China Everbright Financial Management in Qingdao.
Li Xiaopeng, Chairman of the Everbright Group, said that the Everbright Group will accelerate the pace of innovation, use thinking and the means provided by modern technology, rely on big data, the Internet of things, and cloud computing to improve the coverage, utilization, and penetration of financial capital, and improve customer perceptions, well-being, and security.
By the year 2021, China will establish and improve the "four beams and eight pillars" for the development of fintech, further enhance the technology application capability of the financial industry, realize the in-depth integration and coordinated development of finance and technology, and significantly enhance the people's satisfaction with digital, networked, and intelligent financial products and services.
Zhang Xuyang, Chairman of Everbright Financial Management, explained that Everbright’s asset management platform would use technologies such as intelligent investment consulting, intelligent investment research, and big data to help Everbright Financial Management better judge the macroeconomic situation.
In the future, new technologies such as blockchain will also be applied to grasp the direction and trend of traditional and alternative assets, and then be extended to digital alternative assets.
Dong Ximiao, a specially-appointed researcher of the National Finance and Development Lab, said that under the new competition and co-operation situation facing the asset management industry, fintech companies and asset management institutions must jointly explore new growth paths with asset management technology.
Fintech empowers the asset management industry, which is not only the need for the transformation and development of Fintech itself, but also injects new vitality into the development of the asset management business.
Earlier this year, JD.com launched a new asset management technology system to improve the product development and risk control capabilities of asset management using technology and digital means.
The new system starts with the four major capabilities of product design, sales transactions, asset management, and risk assessment to improve the overall intelligent operation of the asset management industry.
Experts believe that while enhancing asset management capabilities and allowing rich product innovation, asset management technology can also enhance risk prevention capabilities and improve the efficiency of asset management.
Zhang Xuyang said that in the past, the risk preference of customers was easily biased through questionnaires, but now the use of artificial intelligence to conduct user portraiting helps better locate customers, and helps to launch products according to the customer's investment preference, which in turn helps to resolve risk.
"Alternative big data such as e-commerce and Spatio-temporal data can help us better characterize the activity and prosperity of a region and an industry. "
While defusing risks, big data technology will also help improve risk control, Zhang said.
There is a new record for the deepest railway tunnel shaft in China
China News Service, Baoshan, September 27th (Zhang Weiming, Xu Weiguo, Zhou Jingbo) After more than 1200 days and nights, digging and track-laying for the Dali-Ruili Railway’s No. 1 Shaft of Gaoligong Mountain Tunnel was completed on September 27th, at which point the shaft extended 762.59m under the surface, breaking the record for the deepest railway tunnel shaft in China, and this record was set despite the risk of a massive water burst.
The Dali-Ruili Railway’s Gaoligong Mountain Tunnel, located in Yunnan province is 34.5 km long in total, runs across the Gaoligong Mountains from the west bank of Nujiang River, and is the longest two-lane single-tube tunnel in Asia.
The tunnel runs through 19 fault zones and has a maximum depth of 1,155m, and due to the fact that it covers nearly all possible unfavorable geological conditions and major risks for tunnel construction, the Gaoligong Mountain Tunnel is called the "geological museum" of tunnel construction.
The shaft is the most important service gallery for the Gaoligong Mountain Tunnel, and is crucial to important tasks, including achieving "short tunneling time for long tunnels" work planes, and serving as permanent ventilation for later railway operations.
The successful excavation of No. 1 Shaft to the bottom marks the beginning of horizontal tunnel construction for Gaoligong Mountain Tunnel; when the shaft station is excavated and equipment is replaced, there will be 4 additional working planes at the bottom to speed the excavation of the main tunnel.
"The Shaft is entirely inside a granite formation, and there are many fractures in the granite formation, so there is no way to prevent the continuous flow of water from the top to the bottom, which is to say that essentially, the water pressure is the same as the depth of the shaft. "
Chief Engineer Si Jingzhao of the China Railway Tunnel Group Dali-Ruili Railway Project Team told this reporter that during shaft construction, sudden muddy water bursts were a common occurrence, causing the risk of collapse and other dangers, and that the builder invited experts to the site to diagnose and discuss countermeasures more than 20 times.
“The maximum water burst in the shaft is higher than 300 m3/h, and the shaft bottom is deeper than 700m, which means that the water pressure is equivalent to that 700m under the sea. "
Si said, "If we didn’t pump out and drain the water in time, the shaft would be flooded by 10 meters of water in an hour, which meant we spend almost 85% of our time in handling the water and just 15% actually tunneling. "
To overcome geological challenges at No. 1 Shaft, such as longitudinal joint development in the surrounding rock, sudden muddy water bursts, and water-rich granite, systematic water control measures which combined "water exploring, grouting, and tunneling" were adopted during tunnel construction to reduce construction risks.
After several improvements, a mechanized construction line including an excavation system, debris hauling system, suspension system, and winch hoisting system was developed for the construction of No. 1 Shaft to ensure whole-process mechanized operation including drilling, blasting, debris hauling, formwork installation, and concrete pouring, which accelerated the construction progress.
Finally, after more than 1200 days and nights, the shaft was successfully tunneled to a depth of 762.59m.
Dali-Ruili Railway is 330km long in total, and is an important part of the China-Myanmar international corridor, as well as an important “Belt and Road transportation infrastructure.
After it opens to traffic, the time to drive from Dali to Ruili will be shortened from the current 6 hours to 2 hours, which will greatly improve the transportation system in west Yunnan and facilitate economic and trade cooperation and friendly personnel exchanges between China and countries in South Asia and Southeast Asia.
Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor: As a Chinese Person, I’m Proud Of China’s Achievements
Hong Kong press circles celebrate the 70th anniversary of China’s founding.

“Over the past 70 years, China has always striven to move ahead and overcome difficulties, and has made numerous obvious achievements, and as a Chinese person, I am proud of these achievements,” said Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor.
Since its return to China, Hong Kong has continued to maintain a close connection with the mainland, and the two have made progress together and shared substantial achievements.
Under the premise of “one country, two systems”, Hong Kong will continue to play to its advantages, seize the opportunities offered by the “Belt and Road” and the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, and build a better future for Hong Kong.
She also said that Hong Kong has been increasingly been the subject of controversy over the past few months, that every Hong Kong resident is affected under such circumstances, and that journalists face unique challenges.
At this crucial moment, all those engaged in journalism should continue handling these difficulties in a hands-on manner, provide fair and impartial news in the spirit of professionalism, and play a part in building the future of Hong Kong and bringing society back to rational communication and dialogue.
New China’s splendid history is also Hong Kong’s journey of development and progress, as well as sharing weal or woe with the Mainland.
Especially since the return of Hong Kong to China, the central government has unwaveringly implemented the policies of “one country, two systems”, “Hong Kong people administering Hong Kong”, and a high degree of autonomy, and as such, Hong Kong and the mainland will continue to work together with one heart, and will help and support each other to create win-win miracles of economic development.
For this purpose, those in Hong Kong’s journalism industry gathered here to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China.
He said that in the past three months, a series of violent activities that break the law and destabilize society have occurred in Hong Kong, and some media have released false news which distorts the facts and fuels the violence.
He called upon the media to eliminate vice and exalt virtue, thereby creating a good environment where all citizens can jointly fight against violence and uphold the rule of law.
Media professionals should abide by the professional norms of journalism, and should guide citizens to consciously reject violence and maintain the law by releasing honest reports and responsible remarks.
About 500 people from Hong Kong’s press circles and all walks of life attended the reception, where together with the officiating guests, they proposed a toast to the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China.
The reporter learned from the Publicity Department of the Xining Municipal Committee that Xining will implement the Xining Civilized Behavior Promotion Regulations from October 1st, which focus on 15 types of uncivilized behavior, such as pedestrians who do not follow the traffic lights and throw objects from buildings, so a list of key management will be made and corresponding penalties will be set.
Wang Shengbin, deputy director of the Publicity Department of the Xining Municipal Committee and director of the Municipal Civilization Office, explained that since Xining was awarded the title of National Civilized City in 2017, the civilization and moral standards of Xining citizens have improved significantly.
However, uncivilized behaviors such as pedestrians jaywalking, running red lights, and non-motorized vehicles not following traffic lights; throwing objects at height and Windows; smoking in public places, dog walking in public places, and laissez-faire defecation are still very prominent and easy to rebound, which should be resolved as soon as possible.
The Regulations, combining the reality of Xining, put forward more comprehensive and higher standards for the civilized code of conduct for individuals and units from public places, public order, public facilities, public environmental sanitation, civilized travel, civilized tourism, civilized Internet access, civilized campus construction, promotion of civilized family construction, execution of official duties, commemoration of heroes and martyrs, medical services, etc., so that the whole society can understand what it can do, what it advocates, and what it prohibits.
“Formulating regulations to eliminate blind spots and misunderstandings in the field of civilized behavior cognition, and comprehensively regulate citizens' behavior, housekeeping, dining, travel, education, tourism, Internet access, green living, wedding and funeral services etc., will provide a strong legal guarantee for the normalization of mass spiritual civilization in Xining city. "
said Qiu Huaijun, secretary general of the Standing Committee of the Xining People's Congress.

A British Family Stuck in France for 5 Days Due to Car Keys Lost in a Lake
Recently, a couple with two children went to France for a holiday from Wales, but lost their car keys in a lake and they had to wait there for a new key from the automaker, which took 5 days.
Afterward, the family was finally able to leave France.
It is reported that on September 16, local time, a British family was visiting a lake in France, and their daughter accidentally knocked over their bag, dropping the car key from the bag into the lake.
They spent hours looking for the key, but failed to find it.
Worse, all their belongings and cash were locked in the car.
They had purchased insurance before departure, but the insurance company refused to give any compensation because their car was not at risk of being stolen.
Out of frustration, they called a tow truck and had their car taken to a garage, and then ordered a new key from the automaker.
A few days later, the British tourists finally received the new key and left France.
However, their tour reservations were cancelled due to the loss of the key.

Survey on consumption in “National Day” holiday: More diverse tourism modes are becoming the foremost choice.
As the National Day holiday approaches, people's holiday plans are gradually being finalized.
This reporter of Securities Daily investigated the arrangements for the “National Day” holiday in Wechat Moments in the last few days, and according to feedback from nearly 20 people, although plans differ, “tourism + consumption” has become the key word for the “National Day” holiday.
Specifically speaking, from the feedback obtained by the reporter of Securities Daily, over half of the people are choosing to travel.
Mr. Liu, who lives in Tianjin, said “he plans to travel to Shanghai with his family during the ‘National Day’ holiday, first to Disneyland, and then travel to the surrounding cities”; Miss Li from Beijing chose to travel to Taiwan in our country, “My family of three plans to leave on September 28 to take 10-day tour around Taiwan”; Miss Ma from Chongqing plans to travel abroad, with Singapore as the destination; Mr. Zhang from Hebei plans a road trip with his family, and said that, “My daughter is less than 2 years old, so it isn’t convenient to go on a long journey, which is why we plan to drive to Shandong to spend a few days by the seaside ”.
The Report on Residents Travel and Travel Trends in 2019 National Day Golden Week, jointly issued by Tongcheng Yilong and LY recently showed that the consumption upgrading trend of journeys and travel in the three subdivisions including trips, residence, and travel during the National Day Golden Week of this year is evident.
The rate of travelling by air and high-speed rail has increased steadily, and the proportion of the demand for starred hotels and individualized non-standard accommodation has increased.
The Report on Residents Travel and Travel Trends in 2019 National Day Golden Week issued by Meituan on September 23 showed that travel consumption continued to be vigorous, and that “eating, living, travelling, and playing” diversification and upgrades are appearing.
Much more young people prefer high-quality and unique experiences, and the popularity of cultural tourism, night tourism, and other tourism continues to rise rapidly.
Besides tourism, all kinds of demand for consumption were also stimulated during the National Day holiday.
Mr. Wang, who lives in Chengdu, told the reporter of Securities Daily, “My main plan in this year’s ‘National Day’ holiday is to buy a car. "
The staff in a Beijing automobile brand 4S shop told the reporter of Securities Daily that generally speaking, September and October every year are known as the golden period of car sales.
During National Day, the shop holds many activities, such as prize drawings and discounts for visiting the shop.
In addition, many brands have launched new car models recently and it is expected that the new cars will significantly increase sales volume.
Amidst the trend of consumption upgrading, people pay more attention to meeting the demands for “the spirit”, and the ratio of the service consumption in culture, education, and other aspects is increasing.
“Since the birth our child, culture and education consumption have become the major portion of our family’s consumption expenditure”, Miss Du, who lives in Beijing, said.
This year’s ‘National Day’ holiday is well arranged, we will go to 'visit' planetarium, children's theater, meet with a few families to go to Elk Museum to put up tent for camping on the weekend, and also arrange some experience classes. "
In the opinions of some insiders, theoretically, residents' consumption upgrading has evolved from survival consumption to development consumption, and finally to enjoyment consumption, of which a large amount of enjoyment consumption falls under service consumption.
With the continuous development of our country’s economy and society, and the rising of residents' income level, people have higher demands for “spiritual” consumption, and traveling and taking trips is a good way to meet that demand.
In particular, people have enough time during the long “National Day” holiday, so people are more willing to travel and consume, which not only meet the demand for “spiritual” consumption, but also reflect the upgrading of residents' consumption.
I started feeling lonely in the afternoon, and I didn’t want to go out... I’m still not used to the fact that children aren’t around.
Pulling myself together, I said to my dog Nana, "Mom's taking you out.”
I wrote down a few things I had to do when I left home; my Type A blood personality traits were getting stronger, and I felt awkward as well.
Get a suit, buy nutritional grain, pay my bills, and buy sashimi and snacks for Nana.
All these were the reasons to go out.
I said to sister Aiqiang on the phone just now that without Nana, I wouldn’t even have the excuse to buy snacks.
Laughing perfunctorily, she said her child was calling and hung up.
Nana hopped up to the passenger seat and lay restfully, she knew she gets carsick, and she was terrified, but she didn’t want to be without me.
My husband, Boau, returned unusually early.
He said that the salmon with avocado salad was quite delicious, and then went to the bedroom lying on the bed watching TV.
I looked at the clock on the wall, and it was exactly 7 o'clock; in the land of the sunrise, the sun sets early, and it was dark already.
My Moments was full of pictures of bright moon, and I realized that today was Mid-Autumn Festival.
I washed a bunch of grapes from a friend and left half of them for Boau, put the rest in my favorite flower bowl, and took them outside to admire the moon.
Sitting on the ground with Nana, I ate the grapes and she ate the skins, and I spat the seeds away.
The moon was hiding in the clouds, but fortunately, the clouds were moving and the moon flickered, light and then dark, slightly piercing my eyes.
My mind was flooded with all kinds of poems about the moon, but the only verse I could remember clearly was this one: every fifteenth day of the lunar calendar month, there is a full moon at night, and with moonlight shining on the barriers, the moon had just appeared in the sky, and the people were looking up.
Maybe we think too much about the moon, and for this moment, the sentence of "the things of god belong to god, and the things of Caesar to Caesar" feels perfect.
The moonlight belongs to the moon, your mood to yourself.
After eating the grapes, I felt the chill of the cold moon.
Curling up at my feet, Nana snored slightly, so I got up and spread Nana's little blanket over the edge of her little nest, after which she happily laid down on it.
I opened the door and shouted: is the bath water ready?
I couldn’t see the moon from the bathroom window, I could only feel it, so I turned off the bathroom light and opened the glass window.
No moon cakes, no wine.

Chinese students can apply for German undergraduate courses based on their college entrance examination scores from next year
Recently, the Anabin Database in Germany, which is responsible for the assessment and certification of foreign academic qualifications, announced on its website that, from 2020, Chinese high school graduates can apply for German university undergraduate courses directly based on their college entrance examination scores, without having to register at a domestic university in advance.
Previously, Chinese high school graduates who want to apply to a German university had to study for one semester (university under 211 and 985 projects) or three semesters (ordinary undergraduate university) in China and pass the APS or TestAS exams.
The new rules could save at least half a year for Chinese students who want to study in Germany.
It is understood that the new rules will take effect in the second half of 2019.
Applicants should satisfy with the following requirements: complete 12 years of formal compulsory education and obtain a high school graduation certificate; take the unified examination and the college entrance examination and score 70% or above (if the total score is 750, a score of more than 525 is required) including the results of two languages and math or natural science, and other requirements.
However, the requirements of specific majors for the college entrance examination results are different.
For example, to apply for medical science, oral medicine, veterinary medicine, pharmacology, and other majors, the score of the college entrance examination should be 80% of the total or above, including at least two subjects in mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, or the applicant should take the science subject synthesis examination; to apply for a law-related major, the score of the college entrance examination should be 80% of the total score or above, including at least two subjects of foreign language, history, geography, or the applicant should take the liberal art synthetic examination.
According to incomplete statistics, many countries, including Germany, Britain, Canada, and Australia, have recognized Chinese college entrance examination scores.
In the UK, for example, the University of Cambridge, the University of Birmingham, the University of Leicester, and other colleges and universities accept applications from Chinese students based on their college entrance examination scores.
Military "robotic dog" take performance classes first Cirque du Soleil: inclusion in performance considered
The U.S. military has funded a "robot dog" for the battlefield, but its first appearance may be on the circus stage!
Cirque du Soleil said recently that it is in contact with Boston Dynamics, which develops robots, to discuss the feasibility of robots for use in circus performances.
According to a comprehensive foreign media report, Boston Dynamics announced a "Four-legged Robot Spot" promotional video on the 24th, which shows that Spot is an agile mobile robot that can carry 14kg, and has motility that is highly adaptive to off-road terrain, 360-degree obstacle avoidance, navigation, remote control, and autonomy.
In particular, Spot has a dedicated software platform developed exclusively for it so users can set Spot robot functions through various applications.
Boston Dynamics first published the idea of the robot dog in 1992, which caused a sensation at the time, but has not yet put it into commercial use.
However, Boston Dynamics pointed out that Spot has now entered mass production, and most of its subscribers were construction and energy companies.
In addition, Cirque du Soleil is currently in contact with Boston Dynamics, and Cirque du Soleil said the project was still in the concept stage and they were evaluating the potential of Spot for use in live performances.

Will MCA participate in the Parliamentary by-election of Tanjong Piai, Johor?
MCA President Datuk Seri Wei Jiaxiang said, "It will be discussed by the Supreme Council of the National Front! "
Tanjong Piai’ s parliamentary by-election is coming soon, and a great deal of attention is being paid to whether the MCA, a party in the National Front.
However, after the MCA Central Committee convened a meeting, it announced that it would be left to the Supreme Council of the National Front to decide whether this traditional MCA seat should continue belonging to MCA, or should go to another member party.
After chairing the MCA Central Committee meeting on Thursday afternoon, Wei Jiaxiang told the media that any by-elections would be conducted in accordance with the Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) by the National Front, which is to say, the meeting of the Supreme Council of the National Front must pass it before it can be finalized.
He said that because the Election Committee would meet next Monday (1st) to finalize the parliamentary by-election of Tanjong Piai, the Supreme Council of the National Front meeting was expected to be held in early October.
"Yesterday (26th) in the morning, I also met with Datuk Seri Amozacy, chairman of the National Front, and we all agreed that we must retake this seat from the Pakatan Harapan. "
"We have decided to convene a special leadership meeting of the National Front in early October, and the heads of the three parties of the National Front will determine which party will enter the battle. "
Asked whether MCA would stick to entering the race for the traditional seats in front of the Supreme Council of the National Front, Wei Jiaxiang reiterated that as the chairman of MCA, he must act in accordance with standard operating procedures, so any decision must be agreed upon by the National Front.
"In any by-election, some people are willing to go out campaigning, and some parties think that they should come out and do this, but this is commonplace. "
"The most important thing is, what organization and political alliance are we from? "

A Villager in Baokang County, Hubei Province Ordered to “Patrol the Mountain Free of Charge” after Capturing Wild Animals
A villager in Baokang County, Hubei Province was sentenced for hunting wild animals and simultaneously ordered to pay RMB 15,420 (Renminbi, the same below) in ecological environment and resources damages.
In consideration of the fact that the defendant’s family was poor, the procuratorate used substitute labor to replace the ecological repair expense, thereby realizing an organic unity between legal and social effect.
After accepting labor substitution, including “free mountain patrol” for 3 months, the defendant Zhou X developed profound feelings for wild macaques and felt deeply guilty for previously hunting wild animals, said Wang Zhongliang, Deputy Chief Procurator of the People’s Procuratorate of Baokang County on the 27th day of the month.
On June 21st this year, the People’s Court of Baokang County heard a philanthropic civil lawsuit collateral to criminal proceeding initiated by the People’s Procuratorate of Baokang County, and announced the judgment at the court.
The defendant Zhou X was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 3 years with a probation of 4 years and a fine of RMB 3,000, and was ordered to pay RMB 15,420 in ecological environment and resources damages.
The investigation found that from late January 2014, Zhou X had set an electrified net at the cliff and hunted more than 20 wild animals, including goral, muntjak, and tufted deer.
Goral is a Chinese grade-two endangered protected wild animal, while muntjak and tufted deer are listed in the National Terrestrial Wildlife Protection Directory.
During the trial, Zhou X admitted the facts of his offense and behavior, and was willing to bear the collateral civil liability.
However, considering the poor economic conditions of Zhou X’s family, the local village committee, the forest station, and Zhou X reached an agreement on compensation for ecological damages with by labor substitution through mediation by the People’s Procuratorate of Baokang County: Zhou X would engage in macaque taming and care, mountain patrol free of charge, and forest protection for one year at the village macaque reserve, and would provide philanthropic labor services to compensate for biological repair expenses.
The court acknowledged the suggestion of the procurator and agreed that while under probation, Zhou X should actively perform his obligations to “compensate the biological repair expenses with labor substitution”.
So far, Zhou X has engaged in volunteer labor for 3 months, actively patrolled the mountain, and behaved well for 3 months.
In recent years, the People’s Procuratorate of Baokang County has organically fused the procuratorate function and social governance behavior, scientifically employed procuratorate suggestions, surveillance supervision, litigation supervision, and other supervision methods, and also applied judicial means to minimize the impact of offensive behaviors on the biological environment.
The United Nations Issues the “Champions of the Earth Award” to Ant Forest
Against the backdrop of warm applause and magnificent music, Xu Di, the project leader of the "Ant Forest", and Shen Junliang, user representative, walked to the podium to receive the 2019 UN “Champions of the Earth Award” from the host.
The 2019 UN “Champions of the Earth” award ceremony was held in New York, USA, on September 26th, and the Ant Forest project, which allows hundreds of millions of people to take part in environmental action through a mobile applet, won the award under the “Inspiration and Action” category.
The winners were announced a week ago by the United Nations Environment Programs at its headquarters in Nairobi, the capital of Kenya, but the ceremony was still very exciting.
Ms. Inger Andersen, the Executive Director of United Nations Environment Programs, said during an interview with Xinhua News Agency that "Ant Forest" is an exciting innovation that will enable hundreds of millions of people to take action to understand the environmental challenges faced by the human beings and what can we do for the environment.
It uses technology to connect people and the environment, so that every individual can participate in protecting the earth, and it will have a huge impact.
"Ant Forest" was launched by China Ant Financial Services Group (Ant Financial for short) on Alipay in August 2016, where it allows users to accumulate "green energy" by logging their daily green trips, paying utilities online, and other low-carbon activities, and also to "plant trees" on their mobile phones.
For every virtual tree a user acquires, Ant Forest and its non-profit partners will plant a real tree on desertified land.
By August this year, 500 million users of "Ant Forest" had reduced their carbon emissions by 7.92 million tons and planted 122 million trees in desertified areas.
Costa Rica also received the “Champions of the Earth Award” due to their national environment protection efforts, and Carlos Alvarado, Costa Rica’s President, who was there to accept the award, praised "Ant Forest" for its contribution and "impressive ability to inspire so many people to take part in green initiatives."
Jing Xiandong, Chairman and CEO of Ant Financial, said that the “Champions of the Earth Award” is positive recognition for the "Ant Forest" project.
Its technology and open platform that make it possible for everyone to participate in low-carbon life, and the honor for the award belongs to every participant.
Jing said "Ant Forest" had affected 500 million people in the past 3 years, and its goal in the next 3 years is to inspire 1 billion people worldwide to take part in low-carbon activities.
Besides fighting desertification and environmental protection, they are also exploring ways to help farmers create more income from green mountains and rivers.
Apart from providing jobs planting trees, the company hopes to help farmers increase their income through agricultural development projects and e-commerce platforms.
The environmental protection public welfare model based on digital technology created by "Ant Forest" has also been successfully exported to other countries.
In June this year, GCash, the largest digital wallet in the Philippines, launched a Philippine version of "Ant Forest" to encourage users to better protect the environment by living a low-carbon life.
It is said that GCash plans to plant 365,000 trees in the Philippines within a year of the launch of the project in partnership with the Philippine Department of Environment and Natural Resources and Environment Protection Public Welfare Organizations.
The “Champions of the Earth Award” is the UN's highest honor in the area of environmental protection.
"Ant Forest" follows the Builders of Saihanba Forest Farm in China and the Green Rural Revival Program of Zhejiang in China as the third green innovation protection project from China to receive the “Inspiration and Action” award for three consecutive years.
Economic and Trade Friction Affects U.S. Economic "Report Card".
Due to the sharp decline in private sector investment and exports, the growth rate of U.S. GDP in the second quarter of the year has slowed significantly compared to the previous quarter, the United States economic “report card” showed.
Analysts point out that economic and trade frictions and the uncertainty they brought about are the main reasons for the decline in private sector investment and exports in the second quarter.
The final revised data released by the U.S. Department of Commerce on the 26th showed that U.S. GDP grew at an annual rate of 2% in the second quarter, which was the same as the previously revised data, but significantly lower than the 3.1% in the first quarter.
Data showed that consumption growth was the main factor supporting U.S. economic growth in the second quarter.
Personal consumption expenditures, which accounted for about 70% of the U.S. economy, increased by 4.6% quarter-on-quarter, driving 3.03 percentage points of economic growth.
In addition, government consumption expenditure and investment drove economic growth by 0.82 percent.
However, private sector investment in the second quarter fell by 6.3% from the previous quarter, dragging down economic growth by 1.16 percent; exports fell by 5.7% from the previous quarter, and net exports dragged down economic growth by 0.68 percent.
Barry Knapp, managing partner of the Ironside Macroeconomics Consulting Company in the United States, said that instead of maintaining last year's growth, private sector investment had fallen sharply as business confidence was hit by trade frictions and rising uncertainty.
Mr. Knapp believes that U.S. corporate capital spending is expected to remain on a downward trend next year amid policy uncertainty.
While consumption growth provided strong support to the U.S. economy in the second quarter, there are growing signs that trade frictions and the uncertainty they brought have affected consumer confidence and hurt the outlook for U.S. consumption, analysts said.
In a recent survey, 38 percent of consumers spontaneously mentioned the negative impact of tariffs on the U.S. economy, which was the highest percentage in a year and a half, said Richard Curtin, an economics professor at the university of Michigan who led the survey.
Regarding the future trend of the U.S. economy, analysts generally believe that the U.S. economy will continue to slow down.
However, some experts said that if economic and trade frictions are eased, the performance of the U.S. industrial sector and financial markets will improve.
Karin Birch, global economist of the British Economist Think Tank, predicts that the U.S. economy will continue its gradual downward trend this year, and the growth rate will drop to a lower level than that in the second quarter.
Mark Zandi, Moody's Chief Economist, predicts that the U.S. economy will grow 2.3 percent this year and 1.6 percent next year, assuming economic frictions don't escalate.
Ellen Hatzen, an investment manager at Putnam Investments, said the biggest concern for businesses is the trade dispute and the uncertainty it brought about, but if economic and trade disputes can be resolved, the uncertainty will be greatly reduced, and the performance of the industrial sector will be much better.
Matt Merley, stock strategist at Miller-Tabuck Asset Management, said that economic and trade frictions are still the "primary problem" and the main reason for the large fluctuations in the U.S. capital market this year, and whether trade frictions can be properly resolved will be the key to the direction of U.S. capital markets for the rest of the year.
Ningxia Becomes first in the Nation to Establish Annual 10-day Common Parental Leave for Parents of Children Aged 0-3
Safeguarding the legitimate rights and interests of women is an expression of respecting and protecting human rights, and also represents an important indicator of social civilization and progress.
On September 27, the Regulation of Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region on the Protection of Women’s Rights and Interests was adopted by an overwhelming vote at the Fifteenth Session of the Standing Committee of the Twelfth People’s Congress of Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region.
This is Ningxia’s first provincial-level regulation formulated and decreed by an autonomous region to safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of women in a comprehensive and systematic manner, and it will be formally implemented as of November 1, 2019.
According to reports, this Regulation is an amendment to the Measures of Ningxia to Implement the Law of the Peoples Republic of China on the Protection of Rights and Interests of Women adopted in 2007, and contains 65 articles in 9 chapters, including General Provisions, Political Rights, Cultural and Educational Rights, Labor and Social Security Rights, Property Rights, Personal Rights, Marital and Family Rights, Legal Liabilities, and Supplementary Provisions.
In the Regulation, Ningxia encourages an exploratory implementation of parental leave for both parents, which is the first of its kind nationwide.
This April, the General Office of the State Council issued the Guiding Opinions on Promoting the Development of Care Services for Infants Aged Below 3, which describes common childcare by both parents.
When amending the Regulation, Ningxia introduced an innovative concept: “encouraging employers to provide an annual 10-day common parental leave for the couple respectively during the period when the infant is aged 0-3, provided that the couple has an infant in line with laws and regulations”.
At the same time, the Regulation highlights the fight against sexual harassment and the protection of female minors.
Article 43 of the Regulation adopts the latest legislative results in the personality rights section of China’s civil code, and stipulates in detail what constitutes sexual harassment, as well as anti-sexual harassment bodies and mechanisms.
Article 44 of the Regulation expressly forbids sexual assault events against female minors that frequently occur, and requires educational institutions to conduct the related education, protection, and prevention work, making Regulation has become a new benchmark among local legislation for protecting female minors.
As to females’ right to know and to dispose of common properties in the marriage and family, Article 35 expressly stipulates their right to know and to dispose of common properties, and also stipulates the obligations of property registration agencies and related entities, providing a solid institution support for females to protect their rights.
Besides, when addressing sexual discrimination in employment, which is a hotly debated issue in society, Article 26 not only prohibits direct discrimination, but also forbids indirect discrimination, and moreover adopts the latest joint interview practices and strengthens the penalty against the offensive sexually discriminating behavior to safeguard appropriate rights and interests of women.
In recent years, the Women’s Federation of Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region has worked together with the police, procuratorates, courts, justices, civil affairs, and other authorities to introduce and promote social professional forces to mediate marital and family disputes, and has made very significant achievements in this regard.
The Regulation summarizes and upgrades this aspect of law, and several articles of the Regulation encourage the mobilization of social forces and the gathering of social resources to jointly safeguard women’s rights and interests, and requires people’s governments at the county level and above to provide stable institutional support and security through service procurement.
Inner Mongolia Xing’an Yuan Longping Workstation: A Saline-Alkali Tolerant Rice Harvest of over Five Hundred Kilograms
This reporter learned from the Administrative Office of Xing’an Prefecture, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, that there was good news from the Saline-Alkali Tolerant Rice Harvest Evaluation Meeting of the Xing’an Yuan Longping Workstation, which was that the yield per mu broke through five hundred kilograms.
The expert team, consisting of 6 members from the Heilongjiang Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Yangzhou University, and the Hunan Provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs harvested the “Xing Saline Series” rice in the field.
Through the expert evaluation, on land with a pH value of 8.8 to 9.6 and a salinity of 5% to 6%, the average yield of the saline-alkali tolerant rice is 508.8kg.
Wang Shigang, Executive Director of Xing’an Yuan Longping Workstation, said, “For our next step, we plan to innovate and reform on the basis of this year’s testing, and redevelop and optimize the saline-alkali tolerant rice species to produce better quality and higher yield. "
Lai Yongcai, Leader of the Expert Team and Deputy President and Researcher of Heilongjiang Academy of Agricultural Sciences, said, “When the production factors remain unchanged, I believe that the miracle of the saline-alkali tolerant rice will continue on saline-saturated land if we persist in strengthening our scientific and technological research. "
Xing’an Prefecture is within the concentrated poverty-stricken areas in the south of the Greater Khingan Range.
In October 2018, the Yuan Longping Workstation was established in Xing’an Prefecture.
Academician Yuan Long led his expert team to accelerate the introduction and promotion of the latest “saline-alkali tolerant hybrid rice” species and advanced technology, construct a 906-mu rice base in Horqin Right Middle Banner, and helped the local poverty-stricken population to increase its income and harvest through the technical route of testing while simultaneously promoting the technology.
This test harvest of saline-alkali tolerant rice brings hope for upgrading saline-saturated fields with low and medium yields to high yields, and also provides the scientific basis for the planting of rice on saline-saturated land with similar conditions in China.
According to au123.com, after a marathon debate and weeks of protests, New South Wales in Australia passed a bill to decriminalize abortion on September 26th (local time).
It is reported that the bill has triggered political debate over the past eight weeks, and since independent MP Greenwich announced the introduction of the bill, deep divisions in the Liberal Party have been revealed.

Liberal MP Tanya Davies, the strongest opponent of the bill, threatened to quit the NSW government and declared that the bill caused a "crisis of Government".

Liu Kun, Minister of Finance: 67 state-owned enterprises and financial institutions have transferred state funds of 860.1 billion yuan to enrich the social security fund.
67 central enterprises and central financial institutions have completed the transfer of some state-owned capital to enrich the social security fund, and a total of about 860.1 billion yuan of state-owned capital has been transferred, finance minister Liu Kun said on the 27th.
Liu Kun made the above statement at the deployment meeting of the national transfer of state-owned capital to enrich the social security fund, which was jointly held by the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, and the SASAC.
“Transferring some state-owned capital to enrich the social security fund is an important measure to reform and improve the basic endowment insurance system; it is a full reflection of the development achievements of state-owned enterprises and the intergenerational equity of the basic endowment insurance system, so it is both a current and long-term policy. "
In 2017, the State Council issued the Implementation Plan for Transferring Part of State-owned Capital to Enrich Social Security Funds, requiring that some central enterprises and some provinces be selected for pilot projects.
According to Liu Kun, the preliminary work has achieved positive results.
At the central level, a total of 67 central enterprises and central financial institutions have transferred in three batches, with a total amount of 860.1 billion yuan transferred from the state.
Among them, the transfer work of the central financial institution that the Ministry of Finance has performed as an investor has been basically completed.
The transfer of central enterprises has reached a certain scale.
At the local level, the preliminary work of the transfer of enterprises has been carried out successively.
By the end of 2018, pilot projects in Zhejiang and Yunnan provinces had been basically completed, with 15.8 billion yuan and 18.5 billion yuan of state capital transferred respectively.
In addition to the pilot provinces, other provinces have successively carried out preparatory work for the transfer, laying a foundation for the next implementation of the project.
According to the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission, the State Administration of Taxation, and the China Securities Regulatory Commission, the transfer of some state capital from the central and local governments to the social security fund will be fully implemented in 2019 and basically completed by the end of 2020.
The meeting held on the same day made specific arrangements for the overall implementation of the work.
The meeting emphasized the need to complete the transfer work pragmatically and efficiently.
“According to the schedule, the transfer work should be basically completed by the end of 2020.
The transfer work is tough job in limited time. "
All regions and departments should carefully organize and make arrangements to ensure that the transfer work is completed as required, solidly advance the work and accurately grasp the content of the transfer policy; strengthen communication and coordination to solve difficult problems in a timely manner, Liu Kun said.
Transferring state-owned assets to enrich social security funds -- starting from “enriching the money bag of social security funds” to provide powerful support for pension security.
However, the author believes that this is not a simple "physical shift" of equity, serves as a "mathematical addition".
On September 20, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission, the State Administration of Taxation, and the China Securities Regulatory Commission jointly issued the Notice on Comprehensively Implementing the Work of Transferring a Portion of State-owned Capital to Enrich Social Security Funds to clarify the schedule of transferring state-owned assets to social security funds, that is, the central and local governments transfer of a portion of state-owned capital to enrich the social security fund would be fully implemented in 2019.
After the issue of the document, the Ministry of Finance and other departments also put it into practice quickly.
On September 25, the Ministry of Finance transferred its 10% of the stock rights of ICBC and ABC to entirely to the social security fund; the total value of the transfer of the two stock rights exceeded RMB 115 billion.
According to the regulations, the financial investors, social security foundations, and other undertaking entities are endowed with the rights of income, disposal, and the rights to know of the state-owned stock rights.
In the announcement, ICBC and ABC showed that the change in equity would not lead to the change of controlling shareholders and actual controllers of the Banks.
To this point, the author believes that similar equity transfers of state-owned enterprises is not a simple change of ownership, but is an "addition operation" that can stimulate a series of effects.
The first step “addition result” of transferring a portion of state-owned assets to social security can naturally reflect the ownership of state-owned enterprises by the whole people, and the development results can be shared by the whole people.
After years of reform and development, state-owned enterprises, especially central enterprises, are mostly in important industries and fields in China's economy, and their overall profitability is strong and stable.
Among them, leading enterprises even continue to achieve better, bigger, and stronger results.
On July 10, at the executive meeting of the State Council, it was decided to promote the transfer of part of state-owned capital in the round to enrich the social security fund this year.
Then, the Ministry of Finance stated that it would work with relevant departments to promote the transfer of a portion of state-owned capital in the round to enrich social security funds, according to the deployment of the executive meeting of the State Council, to fully reflect the intergenerational equity of the basic endowment insurance system and the nationwide sharing of development achievements of state-owned enterprises.
The second “addition result” of the transfer is to heighten the sustainability of social security fund in China to further consolidate the foundation of the old-age social security system.
With the aging of population, the social security fund in China is under pressure, while as the transferring entities, most of the state-owned assets have the ability to sustainably earn profits and pay dividends, which can not only effectively supplement the social security fund, but also provide a source for the social security fund.
According to the calculation, when every 3.8 percentage points of state-owned capital are transferred, the deposit ratio of the basic pension insurance of the enterprise can be reduced by 1 percentage point.
The third “addition result” of the transfer is to add a stabilizer for the capital market.
The way to benefit undertaking entities from this transfer is “dividends first, operation as auxiliaries second”.
As a financial investor of state-owned capital, the social security fund genuinely holds obtaining equity dividends as its first priority.
However, as a value investor in the capital market, social security funds are endowed with a powerful capital operation capabilities.
For listed assets in state-owned capital, the participation of social security funds in shareholding will further optimize the corporate governance structure of listed enterprises, which will be beneficial to improving the level of business operation and have a positive impact on listed companies and the capital market.
Meanwhile, social security funds, as the investment benchmark, have increased their shareholding ratio, which is beneficial to further strengthening its influence in the market and acting as a “stabilizer” in the market.
Furthermore, it is also be beneficial to giving full play to the “value discovery” function of institutional investors and guiding investors to invest rationally and carry out value investing.

Iran upgrades nuclear infrastructure, a further step to scale down its commitments to the nuclear deal
China News, Sept. 27 According to a report by Central News Agency, the United Nations International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said on the 26th that Iran's use of advanced centrifuges to enrich uranium has once again violated the 2015 nuclear deal.
It is reported that Iran is stepping away from the restrictions of the deal in response to Donald Trump's withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal in May 2018 while he resumes and tightens sanctions against Iran.
Iran has suspended two other commitments to keep a maximum 300 kilograms of uranium enriched to 3.67% in July, and is now making further moves.
Under the atomic accord, Iran is limited to operating around 5,000 older IR-1 centrifuges at Natanz (Natanz) to accumulate uranium, and is only allowed to use a small number of more advanced models for research, not to produce enriched uranium.
Succeeding in developing more advanced centrifuges will enable Iran to enrich uranium rapidly, which will quickly bring the material to weapons-grade levels.
The IAEA reported that, “The agency has confirmed that Iran has developed advanced model 2 and model 3 centrifuges on September 25... They are accumulating or have accumulated enriched uranium. ”
Once the IAEA submitted the report to member states on the 26th, a diplomat responded, "They are very busy (at the Natanz Uranium Enrichment Site). ”

Baidu starts trial operations of its first self-driving taxi team
Baidu declared its official start of trial operations of its self-driving taxi in Changsha yesterday.
The first Robotaxi fleet of 45 "Hongqi EV" taxis, which are jointly developed by Apollo and FAW Hongqi, has begun trial operations on open test roads in Changsha.
From today, Changsha citizens can log on to the Apollo official website and apply to participate, and may win the chance to have a trial ride.
One passenger tried the robot-driven vehicles, and said he could start the vehicle with one tap on the screen placed in front of the passenger seat while seated in the back.
For the safety of passengers, and to meet the requirements of current policies and regulations, trial vehicles are equipped with a safety guard in the driver's seat to maximize passenger’s security.
While driving, the vehicles can intelligently change lanes according to the traffic, can judge the driving state of surrounding vehicles, and can automatically avoid situations such as close overtaking.
Throughout the trip, the passenger screen shows pedestrians, cars, and even some traditional blind areas on the road in real time.
Even if some vehicles are blocking the view, the passenger can still see the change of traffic lights and waiting time in advance, making all traffic conditions clear at a glance.
Driverless cars are things we’ve heard of on TV before, and we thought they would take time to truly be adopted in real life, which is why it's amazing to find them in our lives today.
We really hope they can be available to ordinary people in the future.

Lang Ping still feels dissatisfied even after the Women’s Volleyball Team victory: with so many mistakes, it will be very difficult to defeat a powerful rival
On the afternoon of September 27, Beijing Time, the Chinese Women’s Volleyball Team went up against the Dutch Women’s Volleyball Team during the ninth round of the 2019 FIVB Volleyball Women’s World Cup, and finally defeated their powerful rival with a score of 3:1, thereby embracing its ninth successive victory at the World Cup.
However, Chief Coach Lang Ping of the Chinese Women’s Volleyball Team still felt dissatisfied with the team’s performance during the third round.
“After the opposing team became more aggressive when serving balls in the third round, some of our team members (first passer) couldn’t resist the powerful attack, so we also made many mistakes. ”
“With so many mistakes, it will be very difficult to defeat a powerful rival. ”
said Lang Ping in an interview after the round.
“We told our members to be devoted, if the first passer is attacked and can’t get in place, we need to adjust and attack our opponent, and we should also fight our opponent by defending our own goal. ”
Lang Ping also commented on the performance of Zhang Changning, noting that when attacks caused her difficulty, Zhang seemed a little nervous, and wanted so much to make a dunk shot that her motions became distorted.
Lang Ping hoped she would be more patient, saying “We will all protect her”.
China’s Development Is An Opportunity, Not A Threat Or Challenge, To The World.
(70 Years of New China) White Paper: China’s Development Is An Opportunity, Not A Threat Or Challenge, To The World.
This white paper states that China’s development is an opportunity, not a threat or challenge, to the world.
As China’s overall national strength and international influence rapidly increases, some people in the world worry that China is bound to seek hegemony as a strong nation, and some people even promote the so-called “China Threat Theory”.
It arises from various factors - cognitive misunderstanding, ingrained prejudice, psychological imbalance caused by growing and declining power, and deliberate misrepresentation for the purpose of safeguarding vested interests.
There cannot be much dispute that all people, Chinese or otherwise, yearn for their country’s prosperity, national rejuvenation, and social happiness.
“China’s development is an opportunity, not a threat or challenge, to the world. ”
The white paper says that China has always worked to stabilize, promote, reinvigorate, and been the greatest contributor to global economic growth through its technological innovation, role which will be ever more prominent in the future.
At present, the robust Chinese economy is becoming increasingly important to global economic growth, which remains sluggish.
From high-speed growth to high-quality development, the Chinese economy is in the midst of transformation marked by accelerating new-type industrialization, informatization, urbanization, and agricultural modernization, as well as in the midst of profoundly adjusting economic structure, upgrading industry optimization, and constantly emerging new economic growth points.
“According to the research reports by McKinsey Global Institute, by 2040, China, cooperating with other economies, is expected to create a massive economic value of USD 22 trillion to 37 trillion, equivalent to 15%-26% of the global economic aggregate. ”
The white paper emphasizes that both Chinese economy and the world economy have undergone structural changes and become deeply integrated.
With more stable economic operations, higher growth quality, and promising growth prospects, China is beneficial to the global economic development in the long run.
It is neither feasible nor detrimental to regard China’s economic development as a “threat” or “challenge” and disconnect China from the world economy by pushing China out of the global industry chain, supply chain, and value chain.
The white paper says that openness to the outside world on all fronts will bring more opportunities to share the “China dividend” with various countries.
To open up more forcefully at a higher level, China unwaveringly implements a win-win strategy of opening up, and with the largest potential consumer market in the world, China has become the most attractive investment destination, and will go further in its efforts to globalize to benefit even more countries.
“Opening up should be bidirectional and win-win, not unidirectional and win-lose.
Only in this way, both parties in the partnership can work together in the longer run. ”
The white paper says that China has shown its commitment to continuously expanding imports, relaxing control over market access, improving business environment, and strengthening the protection of intellectual property rights, and that other countries should also expand openness and take corresponding measures to improve their business environment.
All parties should work together in the same direction to create an open, inclusive, generous, balanced, and win-win development environment, speed up common development, and create a win-win community of common interests.
The white paper also says that China will provide more public goods to the international community.
In the future, China will strive to promote the high-quality construction of the Belt and Road, build up multilateral dialogues and cooperation platforms, actively participate in the international and regional affairs, and provide more foreign aid.
“China has benefited from the international community in development, and in turn, will always contribute to international community by providing more and better public goods. ”
In the written interview with a reporter from Xinhua News Agency recently, Andre Srepniov, the general manager of the Russian Export Center, said that Russia was willing to strengthen the cooperation with China in the field of economy and trade so as to further optimize the export structure and promote the diversification of Russia's exports to China.
Srepniov showed clearly that forestry, machine manufacturing, and the chemical industry account for a large proportion of Russia's exports to China, and at the same time, the export of agricultural products is also very important, including oil products, meat products, and dairy products, as well as cereals, fish and seafood.
Russia's exports of non-raw materials and non-energy products to China have also shown healthy and stable development for the past few years.
When it comes to optimizing Russia's export structure to China, Srepniov said that Russia has set the task of expanding its export of high-tech products to meet the import demand for high-tech products from countries and regions in the world including China.
Next, Russia will perfect financial and non-financial support measures to promote further growth in the number of high-tech enterprises.
In Srepniov’s opinion, Russia is willing to export construction technology and high-tech construction materials to China, and develop cooperation with China in medicine, aerospace manufacture, and other fields.
There is also great potential for cooperation in the field of urban environmental development for Russia and China.
He stressed that, compared with similar products in the West, Russia's products in many fields “have advantages in quality and are competitive in price”.
When it comes to the two countries' goal of achieving a bilateral trade volume of 200 billion U.S. dollars by 2024, Srepniov said that agriculture, machine manufacturing, the chemical industry, forestry, and other fields will play an important role in achieving this goal.
Russia is inclined to advance the supply diversification in these fields and promote the export of highly processed products.
He stressed that Russia is inclined to promote its exporters to enter the global value-added chain, among which China is one of the development directions.
Russian manufacturers in agriculture, metallurgy, oil and gas, the chemical industry, and other fields are fully capable of participating in this process.
At present, the two countries need to continue deepening the cooperation between enterprises, “to establish more Russian-Chinese joint ventures, and jointly develop exports to third countries”.
Srepniov expressed that the Russian Export Center is taking various measures and services through the Russian Export Credit and Investment Insurance Agency and the Russian Export-Import Bank to provide support for the export of Russian products to China.
At the same time, the Russian Export Center will continue to deepen cooperation with relevant Chinese departments to promote Russian goods to enter the Chinese market more conveniently and develop new types of products to export to China.

Demonstration blasts President in Egypt, demanding he step down, authorities intend to suppress it with force
Twitter hashtags and social media are vigorously advocating that Egyptians should taking to the streets today to peacefully ask President Sisi to step down.
But the authorities have stated their intention to use force to suppress these demonstrations.
Since then military chief Sisi launched a military coup in 2013 to seize power, such dissent has almost disappeared in Egypt, and any form of protest puts participants in extreme danger.
The Guardian reported that Cairo's NGO Egypt Economic and Social Rights Centre has noted that more than 1900 people were arrested since the rare outbreak of protests over the weekend that required Sisi to step down.
Allegations of corruption about Sisi and his family’s pursuit of vanity and waste of money led thousands of people to take to the streets for demonstrations on the 20th.
The Ministry of the Interior of Egypt stated firmly yesterday that it would resolutely respond to any attempt to destabilize the country and would not show mercy.
Downtown Cairo is already heavily guarded, with riot police, security agency vehicles, and plainclothes police everywhere on the streets surrounding Tahrir Square, the tipping point of the Egyptian revolution in 2011.
Al Jazeera reported that security forces detained a number of important scholars and social elites on the 25th, including Nafah, a professor of political science at Cairo University and a well-known columnist.
He tweeted on the 24th, "I have no doubt that continuing the absolute rule of Sisi will cause disaster. "
"It is in Egypt's interest that he step down immediately. "
Prior to Nafah' s arrest, Hosni, a former spokesman for Egypt's former Military Chief of Staff, Annan, was detained.
Annan was arrested last year after trying to compete with Sisi for the presidency.
Constitutional Party Chairman Davoud was also detained.
Analysts and politicians believe that at a time when the economic hardships of the poor and the middle class are intensifying, locking up dissidents reflects the government’s instability and vulnerability.
Opposition leader Ayman Nour, who once competed for the presidency, said, "The arrests underscore the regime's disregard for the Egyptian people and how afraid it is. "
"Because he has ruined the economy and faces widespread political oppression, Sisi is trying to send a clear message to the important generals and politicians who may replace him. "
Noir pointed out that given the continued deterioration of the socio-economic situation, the government's high-pressure approach would only increase people's anger.
Now that the barrier of fear has been breached, he expected more people to take to the streets.
The businessman and actor Ali, who is currently in exile in Spain, and was formerly an Egyptian military construction contractor, began uploading a series of videos early this month, and claimed to benefit from government corruption, triggering a small wave of demonstrations in different cities last weekend.
Ali said that his company Amlak received lucrative contracts without going through the legal bidding process, emphasizing the serious corruption of the military and relatives of Sisi, including First Lady Intissar Amer al-Sisi.
He deeply regretted his involvement.
Ali claims that he helped Sisi build magnificent palaces and luxury hotels that were in sharp contrast to the current poverty of Egyptians and was not paid.
On Twitter, hashtags such as "Come forward and you are not alone", "Sisi is finished", "Sisi get out", and "Next Friday" have attracted thousands of tweets and retweets, whose content calls for the people to take to the streets in a peaceful manner and ask Sisi to step down.
Hollywood Egyptian actor Amr Waked has nearly 7 million followers on Twitter.
He tweeted in Arabic yesterday: "Sisi is doomed ... He's over, and his supporters are making a big mistake now. "

The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region announced on September 27th that a special free training program will be launched for employees affected by recent economic conditions, and a monthly training allowance up to HK $4,000 will be paid to eligible trainees upon completion of the course.
Many boutiques in Harbor City, Tsim Sha Tsui, Hong Kong, have few customers.

Law described the challenges faced by Hong Kong's economy as too urgent to wait for the situation to recede.
Therefore, the Government has launched the free training program called the “Special Scheme for Upgrades in the name of Love”.
It is said all those who lost their jobs or were asked to take unpaid leave by their employers since June 1st will have the opportunity to participate in the program as long as they meet the requirements.
Law said that the courses covered a wide range of areas, the most important of which is "vocational skills" training in 19 industries including tourism, retail, and catering, and that there will also be some new courses on "innovative technologies" and cross-industry "general skills".
Yu Peng-chun, the chairman of the Employees Retraining Board, said that all courses are free of charge and the program is expected to support about 10,000 people in need.
Participants who have completed the full-time or part-time course with an attendance rate of 80% will receive a special allowance of HK $4,000 per participant per month.
The training course will last 2 to 3 months and will be offered by about 50 training institutions, will be available since October 3rd to March 31st next year, and each person can sign up for up to 4 courses.

Does exercise tire both the body and the brain?
A study of athletes indicates that the brain also shows signs of fatigue after intense exercise, according to Sputnik.
The study, led by Mathias Pesiglione from the Pitie Salpetriere Hospital in France, showed a weak link between mental and physical work: both require cognitive control of activities.
Mathias Pesiglione explains, “You need to control the process that can force you to stop when your muscles and joints are sore. "
The study was initiated by the French National Institute of Sport, Expertise, and Performance (INSEP).
INSEP’s experts are responsible for guiding athletes in preparation for the Olympics.
Some athletes suffer from overtraining syndrome, a condition in which they feel uncontrollably tired after high-intensity exercise, and their bodies can’t recover, resulting in performance decline.
INSEP put forward this question: Is it partially because of neurological fatigue due to excessive mental work?
The study was published in Current Biology.

Helping Chinese Citizens Be More at Ease as they “Go Out” - An Interview with Cui Aimin, Director of the Consular Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
Wherever you go, the motherland is behind you.
On the 25th, the first Ministry of Foreign Affairs Consul Protection Public interest short film was launched, and the line at the end of the short film resonated with the broad masses of netizens.
Cui Aimin, Director of the Consular Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said in an interview with Xinhua News Agency that the short film aims to further make the public feel the sentiment and atmosphere of “diplomacy for the people”, and to make Chinese citizens feel that no matter where they are the world, Chinese diplomats will lend them a helping hand, and provide them with aid, strength, and hope.
There are no trivial matters as far as personal safety overseas is concerned, and we care about every one of our people.
Cui Aimin said that over the past 70 years, the number of Chinese citizens “going out” has increased sharply from “less than one million a year” before reform and opening up to more than 100 million people a year today, and at the same time, the safety of Chinese citizens traveling abroad has become more secure, while the objects of consular protection work and assistance have also expanded from overseas Chinese to include foreign people of Chinese ethnicity, tourists, foreign students, migrant workers, and other groups.
According to statistics, since the 18th CPC National Congress, we have organized and carried out more than 10 major actions to evacuate or transfer overseas Chinese citizens, safely evacuating more than 40,000 Chinese citizens from dangerous and volatile areas.
About 500,000 cases of assistance were accepted and coordinated, involving nearly 1 million Chinese citizens.
In times of danger, the motherland can take you home; and go wherever you want to go, it is no longer a dream.
By the end of August this year, China had concluded visa exemption agreements with 14 countries covering ordinary passport holders, according to Cui Aimin.
In addition, more and more countries have unilaterally granted visa-free or visa-on-arrival facilities to Chinese citizens.
Thailand, Egypt and other 42 countries and regions have unilaterally granted visa-on-arrival to Chinese citizens holding ordinary passports, while 15 countries and regions, including Indonesia, unilaterally allowed Chinese citizens holding ordinary passports to enter their countries without visas.
In addition to visa-free and visa-on-arrival arrangements, it is becoming more convenient for Chinese citizens to apply for visas, and the procedures are becoming simpler.
By the end of August, China had reached agreements or arrangements with 41 countries to simplify visa procedures.
These include the agreement with the United States, Canada, Israel, and Argentina to issue multiple visas to each other for tourism and business personnel for 10 years, and with the United Kingdom to issue multiple visas to each other for travel, business, and family visits for two years, and so on.
The United Kingdom and Belgium jointly launched a “visa one-stop” service, with France, Italy and Singapore, reducing the visa processing time to 48 hours, 36 hours, and 24 hours, respectively.
For business people who often go abroad, the APEC business travel card with multiple entries and convenient customs clearance is a good choice.
According to Cui Aimin, holding the travel card is equivalent to obtaining multiple visas for 16 economies around the Asia-Pacific region for five years, which is of great significance for business people, especially those from private enterprises, as they “go out.”
At present, China ranks first among APEC economies in terms of effective card holders.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs will actively negotiate bilateral visa reciprocal agreements, promote more countries to adopt visa facilitation measures for Chinese citizens, turn the results of diplomatic work into measures to benefit and facilitate the people, and constantly increase the ‘value' of Chinese passports.
National Day is approaching.

Jiangxi: The "Line Guard” guards the security of operations of passenger transportation lines.
According to the Jiangxi Provincial Highway Transportation Management Bureau, to date, 1,334 passenger transportation lines in 11 districts and cities in Jiangxi and 6 counties directly under the jurisdiction of the province all have "line guards."
The person in charge of the Jiangxi Provincial Highway Transportation Management Bureau explained that due to the formal safety management of some passenger transport companies, the responsibility of safety targets has not been fulfilled, that illegal actions such as speeding in passenger vehicles and driving while fatigued have occurred frequently, and the dangers in passenger transportation are severe.
In order to further consolidate the main responsibility of road passenger transport enterprises for safe production and ensure the safety of passengers, Jiangxi started the pilot project of the "line guard system" in 2017 and began to gradually promote it throughout the whole province in 2018.
At present, 92 road passenger transport companies in Jiangxi have implemented the "line guard system" and assigned 1,334 "line guards" for passenger transportation management, which cover 4,824 passenger buses.
According to reports, the "line guard" is generally designated by passenger transport companies to take charge of the specific management of the people, cars, lines and other work, to ensure that the person in charge has comprehensive control over the line, vehicle, driver, and operating environment, so as to ensure the operational safety of the line.

The United States will deploy more air defense systems and forces to Saudi Arabia
The United States Department of Defense announced on September 26th that it will deploy one Patriot air defense system, 4 groups of Sentinel radar systems, and around 200 more troops to Saudi Arabia in the aftermath of the attack on Saudi oil facilities.
The Pentagon said in a statement that this deployment will enhance air defense and anti-missile capabilities at key military targets and civilian infrastructure in Saudi Arabia and bolster the U.S. military presence in the region.
The statement further says that U.S. Secretary of Defense Dr. Esper has also approved the preparation of two Patriot air defense systems and one THAAD anti-missile system in the deployment sequence.
Some US defense media have questioned the effectiveness of the deployment, saying that the main interception targets of the Patriot and THAAD systems are not low-altitude targets such as the drones and cruise missiles that attacked Saudi Arabia as claimed by the US.
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said in his speech in the general debate of the United Nations General Assembly on September 25th that Iran can help maintain "safety in the Persian gulf" and ensure the smooth and safe navigation of oil carriers through the Strait of Hormuz, provided all countries enjoy equal rights.
He also emphasized that safety of the region can only be achieved when U.S. forces withdraw from the region.
On September 14th, several drones attacked two Saudi Aramco oil facilities, resulting in a fire.
The United States blamed Iran for the attack and imposed new sanctions upon Iran.
Chairman of Thalys’s increase in shareholding plan completed last year, called on employees to increase their holdings by up to 43%.
On the evening of September 25, Thalys (603716.SH) announced that the company’ s actual controller and chairman, Wen Wei, had increased his holdings of 1054200 shares in total through the Shanghai Stock Exchange’ s collective bidding transaction, accounting for 0.5139% of the company's total share capital,; the total increase added up to RMB 20.0926 million (including stamp taxes, commissions, interest and other transaction costs), and completed his plan to increase his shareholder ownership.
It is reported that before the implementation of this shareholding increase plan, Wen Wei directly held 8.58 million shares of Thalys, accounting for 4.18% of the company's total share capital; the controlling shareholder Tianjin Ruimei Scientific Instrument Corporation Limited (hereinafter referred to as "Tianjin Ruimei") held 82.835 million shares of the company, accounting for 40.06% of the company's total share capital, and Wen Wei holds 66.06% shares of Tianjin Ruimei, who is the actual controller of the company.
It is worth mentioning that this is not the first time that Thalys has offered positive measures.
Since September last year, in a short period of only one year, Thalys has successively introduced measures such as executives' increase in holdings, a proposal of fallback increases in the holdings of the chairman, share repurchases, and equity incentives.
On September 18 last year, Thalys announced that the company's seven senior management personnel, including Liu Wenhao, planned to increase their holding to 390300 shares (accounting for 0.1922% of the company's total share capital), so the total increase added up to 7022900 yuan, and the current shareholding plan has been fully implemented.
Shortly thereafter, Wen Wei, the chairman and actual controller of Thalys, proposed a plan for the employees to increase the company's shareholder ownership, and promised to compensate them himself should any losses occur.
The holding increase period is from October 19 to October 31, 2018, and the maximum limit of the increase of the total holding of the company's shares is not to exceed 150 million yuan, but after the increase, the company's shares must be held continuously for more than 12 months, and the employees had to remain employed at the time of receiving compensation.
This reporter found that during the period of the above-mentioned initiatives to increase employee holdings, the stock price of Thalys was as low as 14.02 yuan and as high as 16.44 yuan, and based on the closing price of Thalys on September 25, the price was 20.02 yuan, while employee holdings increased by up to 42.80% and down to 21.78%.
On January 21 of this year, Thalys once again approved the company's share repurchase plan, announcing that the total amount of funds intended to be used to repurchase shares was not less than 160 million yuan, but not more than 280 million yuan.
On August 8 this year, the company issued the announcement of the "2019 Thalys Restricted Stock Incentive Plan (Draft)" and set very high unlocking performance conditions.
It was shown in the announcement that in 2018, operating income boosted equity incentives, and the growth rates, from 2019 to 2022 for the four fiscal years were not less than 30%, 70%, 120%, and 185% respectively.
Judging from Thalys' s performance in the first half of the year, the company maintained high growth and exceeded the unlocking condition of 30% growth this year.
In the first half of the year, it realized operating income of 842 million yuan, a year-on-year increase of 46.50%; net profit attributable to shareholders of listed companies was 56.2324 million yuan, a year-on-year increase of 16.46%.
Since the 2018 Interim Report, Thalys has achieved a year-on-year growth rate of more than 38% for five consecutive reporting periods, with a maximum growth rate of 59%.
In 2018, the company established a dual-core-driven collaborative development strategy based on the medical inspection intensive operation service (IVD Business), regarding the medical consumables intensive operation service (SPD Business) and the regional inspection center as breakthroughs, and iteratively upgraded on the basis of the advantages of the previous IVD Business to promote the SPD Business.
Relevant personnel at Thalys told reporters that in order to comply with the general trend of medical reform and achieve rapid expansion, the three major businesses of Thalys were steadily advancing.
In the SPD Business field, in January of this year, Thalys announced that it had signed the "Cooperation Agreement for the Construction of Intensive Medical Consumable Operation Platforms and Daily Operation Management Services" with Lingwu People's Hospital and Lingwu Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital.
"In fact, Thalys is vigorously expanding its SPD business to provide medical institutions with sophisticated operating services such as centralized purchases of medical consumables, warehousing management, distribution, and settlement to obtain long-term revenue, "
said the person mentioned above.
On September 17, according to the Zhejiang Government Procurement Service Information Platform of the Zhejiang Government Procurement Network announcement, Thalys won the auction of a "medical consumables (including reagents) in-hospital logistics extension service project" from Shao Yifu Hospital of the medical college of Zhejiang University .
Pharmaceutical industry analysts pointed out that this bid was very profitable, because Shao Yifu Hospital is the first public hospital in mainland China to pass the Joint Commission International (JCI); the smooth implementation of this project in the future is also an important development opportunity for the hospital.
According to its analysis, previously, Thalys’s business areas basically covered all the provinces in the country through regional expansion, national strategic cooperation, and channel mergers and acquisitions.
Winning the bid of Shao Yifu Hospital means acquiring another city in Zhejiang, and they should continue to replicate this model in different hospitals to enhance the company's competitiveness in the East China market.
In addition, this year, Thalys is also deploying in emerging areas such as industrial marijuana and blockchain technology.

The British oil tanker Stena Impero, held by Iran for more than two months was, released and set off from Bandar Abbas Port, Iran, on the morning of September 27th for international waters.
In the middle of last month, the authorities in Gibraltar, a British overseas territory, released an Iranian oil tanker that had been held for more than a month.
According to the Islamic Republic News Agency, at 9 am September 27th (local time), the British oil tanker Stena Impero left Bandar Abbas Port for the international waters of the Persian Gulf.
Iran’s Hormozgan Port and Maritime Organization confirmed that the tanker's commander and crew had made formal and written commitments that, despite the fact that it was impounded, they had no claims for compensation.
Stena Bulk, the Swedish owner of Stena Impero, also said the tanker was sailing from Bandar Abbas Port.
Moreover, Refinitiv's vessel tracking data also found that the tanker began moving on September 27th and left Bandar Abbas Port.
The British-flagged oil tanker Stena Impero was impounded by Iran in July.
The Company’s spokesman said the tanker was preparing to leave Bandar Abbas Port.
Two weeks after Britain impounded an Iranian tanker in the sea area of Gibraltar, Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps detained the tanker, Stena Impero, in the strait of Hormuz waterway.
The tanker was released in August.
Earlier this week, the Iranian government spokesman said all legal procedures needed to release the Stena Impero had been handled.
However, Iran says the investigation is ongoing.
Several Iranian media also posted videos of the tanker's departure.
On July 19th, Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps Navy detained a British oil tanker, the Stena Impero, in Iranian waters in the strait of Hormuz, and escorted it to Bandar Abbas Port.
The Iranian oil tanker Grace 1, which was being held, left the waters of Gibraltar.
On July 4th, the authorities in Gibraltar, a British overseas territory, seized the oil tanker Grace 1, which was carrying Iranian crude oil in the strait of Gibraltar, on suspicion of transporting oil to Syria in violation of EU sanctions.
One month later, on August 15th, the authorities in Gibraltar announced the release of the Grace 1.
This afternoon, a special conference on the review and rectification of thematic education of undergraduate universities and colleges in the province was held in Changsha.
Wu Lan, deputy secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, emphasized that it was necessary to improve political standing, strengthen political responsibilities, take a rigorous approach to problems to review and rectification, and promote the high-quality development of party building, ideology, and reform and development in universities and colleges through the effectiveness of thematic education.
Wu Lan fully affirmed the preliminary results achieved by the undergraduate colleges and universities in the second batch of thematic education.
She pointed out that carrying out the thematic education of “remaining true to our original aspirations and keeping our mission firmly in mind” was a major deployment made by the Party Central Committee; all undergraduate colleges and universities must thoroughly study and implement the spirit of the important speech made by general secretary Xi Jinping on carrying out the theme of “remaining true to our original aspiration and keeping our mission firmly in mind”.
We should carefully complete the prescribed actions of the thematic education, especially the series of issues identified through solid rectification, and coordinate the reform and development of the school from the political height of enhancing the "four consciousnesses", achieving the "two maintenances", and fulfilling the original mission, to achieve the goal of "neglecting neither and improving both".
Wu Lan stressed that we must adhere to the principle that one shall always keep an eye on himself, focus on self-reflection, use the "four comparisons" and "four searches" standards to discover problems and open up paths to seek suggestions from the teachers, students, employees, parents, and all sectors of society, and we should dig deep into the root ideologically and then clarify the direction of our efforts and measures to improve ourselves to come up with practical and effective means to solve difficulties.
It is necessary to adhere to precise force development and strengthen true reforms to truly and thoroughly implement the word "rectification".
It is necessary to do a good job in combining thematic education with "enhancing morality and fostering talents", fully implement responsibility for rectification, and ensure that all the problems are settled so as to achieve the actual results of rectification.
We must adhere to solving both the root cause and the problem itself, improve long-term mechanisms, weave the institutional cage tightly, strengthen the rigid constraints of the system, and ensure that all work is rule-based, and all the relevant people, affairs, and power are truly managed by the system.
We must insist on leaders setting examples: leading cadres should take the lead in arming themselves with theory, in carefully reviewing and rectifying, in strict self-discipline to give play to the role of "key minorities" as a model, and strive to complete the thematic education review and rectification tasks.
The responsible comrades of the Party Committees from five universities including Hunan University and the responsible comrades from relevant provincial offices also made speeches.
The "One AC, One DC", dual UHV projects are put into service
The Zhundong-Wannan ±1,100 kV UHV DC transmission project and the Sutong 1,000 kV UHV AC GIL tunnel project were put into service on the 26th.
These two projects currently boast the world's highest electricity transmission capacity in their respective transmission modes, and enable the China’s energy resource allocation to be optimized to a much greater degree.
Guo Zhi, chief economist of the National Energy Administration, said that the Zhundong-Wannan project is the transmission project with the highest power transmission capacity and the longest transmission distance globally.
Its completion is of great significance in promoting the development of energy bases in Xinjiang and ensuring the power supply in East China.
GIL means gas-insulated transmission line.
And with the highest voltage level and the highest transmission capacity among GIL projects worldwide, the Sutong GIL Tunnel Project has closed the loop of the ‘AC double-loop network’ among the main power grids with the highest voltage level in East China.
The State Grid said that the transmission distance from the Zhundong to Wannan is 3,324 kilometers.
Using conventional technology, more than 15% of all electricity would be lost on the way, but through research and development, the economically feasible transmission distance was raised above 3,000 kilometers.
The Zhundong-Wannan project can transmit 100 million kWh every 8 hours and 20 minutes, which can help to absorb existing new energy sources in Xinjiang.
Assuming full load, the power transmitted annually on this line alone will reach 60 to 85 billion kilowatt hours, which could satisfy more than half of Shanghai's annual electricity consumption.
The Sutong GIL tunnel project is a UHV AC loop project crossing the Yangtze River.
If conventional overhead lines were used to cross the river, two giant iron support towers more than 450 meters in height would need to be built on the Yangtze River, and an artificial island larger than four soccer fields would need to be built for each tower.
State Grid boldly innovated and developed compact UHV AC GIL transmission technology to cross the river through underwater tunnels, thereby avoiding any impact it on this golden waterway.
Both projects are significant leaps forward in China's electrical equipment manufacturing capabilities.
The State Grid has completed "10 AC, 11 DC" UHV projects, and "4 AC, 3 DC" projects are still under construction.
SAFE: China's foreign debt structure continues to improve.
“Overall, China's external debt structure has been continuously optimized and its stability has been enhanced. "
Wang Chunying, spokesman and chief economist of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, said on the 27th that the main indicators of China's foreign debt are within the internationally recognized safety line, and that the risk of foreign debt is generally controllable.
Wang Chunying made the remarks in response to a reporter's question when the SAFE released the data of the end of June 2019.
Data shows, by the end of June 2019, the balance of China's full-caliber foreign debt (including local and foreign currencies) was 198 billion US dollars, an increase of 26.3 billion US dollars or 1.3 percent over the end of March 2019, mainly due to the increase in the balance of debt securities.
In the second quarter of 2019, more than 70% of the increase in China's total foreign debt was driven by the purchase of domestic RMB bonds by non-residents, and the non-residents were mainly medium and long-term investors such as the Central Bank.
At the end of June 2019, the proportion of medium and long-term foreign debt increased by 3 percent compared with the end of March 2019, and the proportion of local currency foreign debt increased by 1 percent compared with the end of March 2019.
Wang said that with the inclusion of China's domestic RMB bonds in the Bloomberg Barclays Global Composite Index in April 2019, international investors have further enhanced their recognition of China's bond market and continued to increase their holdings of domestic RMB bonds.
“China's international balance of payments has maintained an overall balance and the external debt risk is under control. "
This journalist learned on September 27 from the Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences that so far, Yunnan has effectively prevented the spread of Spodoptera Frugiperda, which has not broken out over a large area and caused disasters, and the province has also achieved periodical results in prevention and control work.
This January, Spodoptera Frugiperda was first found to have migrated from overseas regions to Jiangcheng County, Puer City, Yunnan Province, and confirmed to have occurred in 129 counties in the province, and had also spread to the hinterland regions of China, thereby posing a direct threat to China’s grain production.
Spodoptera Frugiperda is a major polyphagous agricultural pest insect that originated in the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas and can migrate over a long distance, and as stated in the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization’s global warning about this major migratory insect, it is “international, migrant, fulminant, and destructive”.
The insect threatens more than 80 crops, including corn, sugar cane and sorghum, and in cases of heavy feeding, may cause a yield loss of up to 70%.
It is difficult to defend against the insect, and China now has no registered pesticides that can prevent it.
After Spodoptera Frugiperda invaded Yunnan, the Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences sent Researcher Chen Aidong, who leads the provincial innovation team on collaborative and green control over cross-border agricultural pests under the Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences, to the front lines along with his team, where they performed a field survey, collected samples, and conducted technical instruction and demonstration.
Chen Aidong’s team first investigated the Spodoptera Frugiperda in respect to its population characteristics, natural enemy insect resources, the characteristics of overseas sources, its population’s migration characteristics, and the toxicity of pesticides and their prevention effect in crop fields.
They actively performed research into and applied green prevention technologies, and achieved over 90% prevention in pilot regions after introducing green new prevention techniques including population monitoring, trapping of adult insects, the scientific use of pesticide, and agricultural measures; at the same time, these measures reduced the use of chemical pesticides, protected natural enemy insect resources and the biological environment, and provided technical support for the province to realize effective control over the outbreaks of Spodoptera Frugiperda and related disasters, as well as offered sustainable treatment.
So far, Yunnan has effectively prevented Spodoptera Frugiperda, which has not broken out over a large area and thus caused a disaster, and the province has made periodical achievements in prevention and control work.
For its next step, the Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences will mainly investigate the ecological mechanism behind the migration, invasion, and outbreak of the population, and make breakthroughs in biological prevention and green preventive technology systems.
At the same time, they will actively carry out international cooperation and seek to build a key joint laboratory as well as a joint monitoring network and pilot area in overseas regions to enhance the province’s capacity to monitor and issue comprehensive warnings about Spodoptera Frugiperda.

White Paper: China Has Found A Development Path Suited To Its Actual Conditions
Beijing, September 27 (China News Service) The State Council Information Office of the People’s Republic of China released the white paper China and the World in the New Era on September 27.
The white paper says that over the past 70 years, China has been moving forward against all odds and exploring its path to development, and that the Chinese people have opened up the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics, and achieved remarkable outcomes.
The white paper states that the key to China’s development lies in self-reliance and hard work.
China’s development lies in its down-to-earth spirit of “trading 800 million shirts for one Boeing”, which several generations of Chinese people have carried onward with ceaseless struggle, expended difficult-to-imagine effort, labor, and sweat; it also lies in its responsible spirit of “carrying one’s own burden”, through which China never makes trouble for others, transfers contradictions, buys or sells by force, or loots resources of other countries, neither in adversity or in prosperity; it also lies in its spirit of exploration of “crossing the river while feeling the stones on the bottom”, through which China discovered a development path with Chinese characteristics by adapting to the Chinese situation, drawing lessons from the past, drawing on all the outstanding achievements of human civilization, and making bold trials, rather than following old ways like imperialism and colonialism, nor following western development patterns.
The white paper states that China has developed in connection with the world, that China’s development is a positive force for global peace and development, and that the Chinese path suits China’s national conditions and adapts to demands of the time.
China safeguards world peace with actual deeds.
Over the past 70 years, China has never provoked any war or conflict, nor invaded any other country.
The white paper states that over the past 70 years, China has achieved great success in its development, the root cause of which is that China has found its development path of socialism with Chinese characteristics and unwaveringly followed this path.
This path is established according to China’s national conditions and for the purpose of giving top priority to people’s interests, reforming and innovating, pursuing common development in opening up, and fully advancing the law-based governance.
As a large country with complex national conditions, China faced tremendous difficulties in governance, so without centralization and unification, as well as strong leadership, China might split up and bring catastrophe to the world.
The white paper also stated that over the past 70 years, China has overcome various risks and challenges and created a succession of numerous remarkable China miracles.
Especially since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, China has made historic achievements and changes in its development, and has made a great leap from independence, to prosperity and strength, and now is closer to the great goal of the Chinese national rejuvenation than ever before.

The Tianjin Chow Tai Fook Financial Center, the Tallest Building In Northern China, Has Been Completed, Creating More Than 100 National Patents
The completion ceremony for the Tianjin Chow Tai Fook Financial Center, the tallest building in northern China, was held in Binhai New District, Tianjin on the afternoon of the 26th, marking the success of a synergetic management platform based on high-precision BIM modeling, the building information modeling independently developed by the China Construction Eighth Engineering Division’s Tianjin Chow Tai Fook Financial Center Project Department, which won first prize at the AEC Excellence Awards in the field of skyscraper construction.
Tianjin Chow Tai Fook Financial Center, located in the Tianjin Economic-Technological Development Area, covers an area of 390,000 square meters and is 530 meters high, including 4 underground floors and 100 floors above the ground, and it is designed to serve diverse business needs including Grade-A offices, luxury apartments, and five-star plus hotels; upon completion, the project will become an important international landmark building in Tianjin.
The entire project consumed more than 70,000 tons of steel, about 376,000 meters of high-altitude butt welding (equivalent to 42.5x Mount Everest in height) enough welding wire to circle the Earth 40 times, and about 42,000 PCS of steel components, over 50% of which are super standard, including the world’s largest double-barreled oval steel pipe column with single-layer twist of 90°, said the manager in charge of the China Construction Eighth Engineering Division’s Tianjin Chow Tai Fook Financial Center Project Department.
The Tianjin Chow Tai Fook project is a steel structure of unprecedented complexity and processing difficulty.
Industry insiders said that the Tianjin Chow Tai Fook Financial Center is the first skyscraper project completed or under construction nationwide which comprehensively uses Building Information Modeling (BIM) management.
The project creatively proposed and successfully implemented the “three-total BIM application” model - total involvement, total professional applications, and total process implementation, and developed a synergetic management platform based on high-precision BIM modeling.
During the construction of the Chow Tai Fook project, the project department first built the BIM virtually, and then made scientific and error verifications before any real construction, thereby finding possible construction issues like modification and rework before they occurred, said the person in charge of the project.
In 2017, the BIM innovation achievements of the Chow Tai Fook Financial Center project won the AEC Excellence Awards first prize for construction groups at the Autodesk University & Award Ceremony.
During the construction of the project, the project department created a total of more than 130 national patents.
It’s worth mentioning that the BIM innovation achievements and technological innovations of the Tianjin Chow Tai Fook project not only optimized the complex and overelaborate construction links, they also shortened the construction duration by more than four months and enormously improved safety management.
Recently, the Tianjin Chow Tai Fook Financial Center project also won the International Safety Award (ISA) 2019.

Taiwan Scholars Suggest, Taiwanese Businesses Should Stay Close to the Mainland to Develop Mainstream Industries in an “Age of Uncertainty”
The Taiwan Business Innovation Operation Model Forum 2019 was held in Taipei on the 26th and 27th.
Many representatives of Taiwan businesses and scholars were invited to share their experiences in enterprise transformation, innovation, succession, and market development.
The forum was hosted by the Management Institute in Taipei, and organized by groups including the Capital Securities Corporation and the Outstanding Mainland and Taiwan Business Association.
The two-day meeting was divided into many seminars, covering transformation and upgrading models and business strategies, and more than 100 people attended the meeting.
With growing Sino-US trade friction, Taiwan Businesses are ushering in the “Age of Uncertainty”, said Ch’en Ming Chang, the president of the Management Institute in Taipei.
He believed that Taiwan businesses should keep abreast of the times and stay close to the mainland to develop mainstream industries, especially innovative products related to technology, culture, tourism, and health.
“Taiwan businesses have always valued quality, effectiveness, and delivery. ”
But Ch’en Ming Chang believed that simply following the conditions above is insufficient at present.
He said that Taiwan-funded enterprises must focus on both speed and service, speed up supply chain development, and pay attention to extended services and product life services.
Moreover, Taiwan businesses also need to work hard on “value-added service”.
Hsü Wen T’ang, the representative of Taiwan businesses from Guangdong and the chairman of Yayi Electronics Co., Ltd., said that Yayi Electronics was once ailing due to sudden decline of orders, but the group improved their operating conditions by adjusting structures and activating assets.
After transitioning from traditional electrical appliances to automotive electronic equipment, and entering the smart household appliances industry, the company spent three years before becoming profitable.
Pai Hung Chang, the general manager of Apollo (Zhuhai) Electronics Co., Ltd., suggested providing “one-stop” services to regular customers if there are difficulties in developing new customers.
The reasons why the customers replaced their suppliers are simply poor service, high price, low quality, slow delivery, low variety, and integrity problems, and as suppliers, we should solve these problems while rebuilding our production lines and diversifying our products to become irreplaceable suppliers.
On the 27th, the award ceremony of the “Outstanding Mainland and Taiwan Business Awards 2019”, hosted by Management Institute in Taipei, was held in Taipei.
Lui Cheng Chang, the general manager of Shanghai-based Golden Field, won the “Outstanding Taiwan Business and Cross-Strait Contribution Award”, Economic Daily News reported.
Comments on the new rules are invited: qualification is required for social capital to obtain the right of rural land management
Qualification is required for social capital to obtain the right of rural land management
Opinions are openly being solicited on the Measures for the Administration of Circulation of Rural Land Management Right to supervise the acquisition of land management rights by the circulation of social capital such as industrial and commercial enterprises
The website of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs released an announcement yesterday on requesting public comment on the Measures for the Administration of Circulation of Rural Land Management Right (Draft for Comments)" (hereinafter referred to as "Draft"), to strengthen supervision and risk prevention in the circulation of rural land contracted management rights.
The Draft is open to the public for opinions as of today.
The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs announced that in order to implement the newly revised Rural Land Contract Law, further consolidate and improve the basic rural management system, deepen the reform of the rural land system, and implement "separation of three rights" (the separation of rural land ownership, contract rights, and the right to manage the land), the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs revised the Measures for the Administration of Circulation of Rural Land Contracted Management Right, and formed a Draft for Comments.
A reporter from Beijing Youth Daily learned that the published Draft contains many important amendments for the first time.
The newly revised Rural Land Contract Law defines the scope of land circulation, implements the concept of "separation of three rights", and sets up "rural land contracted management right" and "land management right" respectively, thereby establishing a clear distinction between the transfer, exchange, and transfer of land management rights (lease, subcontract, shareholding or other ways).
To implement the concept of "separation of three rights" and effectively implement the amendments made in the Rural Land Contract Law, and in consideration of the fact that differences exist between the circulation of land management rights and the exchange as well as transfer of rural land contracted management right in terms of parties, procedures, and supervision, the Draft defines the scope of transfer, focusing on the circulation of land management rights, including leasing and shareholding, and as such, the name of the regulation has been changed from "Measures for the Administration of Circulation of Rural Land Contracted Management Right" to " Measures for the Administration of Circulation of Rural Land Management Right".
The transfer and exchange of rural land contracted management rights will be regulated by separate management measures.
The Draft points out that under the "separation of three rights", farmers can only buy shares of the land management right for a certain period of time.
Theoretically, even if bankruptcy liquidation occurs, farmers will only suffer from the risk of losing the right of management, thus it is no longer necessary to stipulate that the contracted land should be returned to the original contractor, which is also in conflict with the Bankruptcy Law.
In order to prevent the risk of farmers losing land, various methods are adopted such as preferred stock, rent before stock, and repurchasing.
Considering that the preferred stock has a more mature theoretical basis in the Company Law, it is suggested that it should be taken as an advocacy provision to prevent the risk of land loss.
