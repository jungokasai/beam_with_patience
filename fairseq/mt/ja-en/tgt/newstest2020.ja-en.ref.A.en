Suzuki Nana reenacts her extremely rude body touching
Furthermore, immediately after the terrestrial broadcast ends at 12:50am, the full lesson and the comedy research lab will be made available to stream on AbemaTV's Abema Video service.
In this episode, Suzuki appears as a professor who is trying her hardest but at some unknown point came to be extremely disliked by the public as she gives her lesson.
Suzuki made her debut as a model in a gal magazine in 2007 at the age of 18.
Since her first appearance on a television show in 2011, she has flourished on variety shows, enlivening the mood with her excited conversation and overreacting.
This year, the first year of the Reiwa era, Suzuki was awarded first place in the variety/other category of the ranking of disliked women published by a weekly magazine.
She has also been ranked second in the entertainment industry as a whole.
Suzuki revealed that her family has also been caused distress, her mother was shocked as a result, and her husband has been teased at work.
During the lesson, Suzuki looks back at how her path as a TV personality led to her attaining the accolade of being at the top of the ranking of disliked women.
Apparently, the origin of Suzuki's sometimes over-the-top conversation and reactions was something that a senior performer told her.
But Suzuki didn't stop at reactions, she also escalated the intensity of her over-the-top body touching and over-the-top dirty jokes.
When Suzuki demonstrates the body touching she had done to other big-name costars in the past, the whole studio is shocked at the level of rudeness.
Immediately after the terrestrial broadcast, the full version of the lesson and the comedy research lab will be available to stream.
In it, Suzuki's hilarious antics from when she was in a gal's club and secrets from alone time with her husband revealed to enliven the mood will all be laid bare.
Setouchi city adds original "digital gift certificate" to gift incentives for hometown tax donors: Sanyo News Digital, San-digi
Digital gift certificate "eMachiGift".
Payment can be made by touching with the designated device
On the 27th, the city of Setouchi made an announcement adding an original digital gift certificate, "eMachiGift," as a return gift to hometown tax donors.
It can be used at all member stores in the city starting in November.
The city is the first local government in prefecture to do so.
If donors pay hometown tax and select digital gift certificate as their return gift, the equivalent of 30% of the donation will be sent to donors' designated smartphones.
The gift certificate is displayed on the screen when a product is purchased, and the store taps a stamp-like designated device to make the payment transaction.
Transfer or resale is prohibited.
Unlike the other gifts, which require a certain amount of time from application to delivery, digital gift certificates can be received instantly.
It can be easily used by tourists.
In addition to the five hometown tax donation portal sites, the city also accepts donation at two dedicated sites.
There are 13 member stores currently and the city is aiming for 100 stores by the end of this fiscal year.
In June, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications introduced a new system, under which return gifts must be locally produced items with a value below 30% of the donated amount, in an effort to prevent excessive competition between local governments.
"The member stores will be merchants who sell locally produced items, and will fit within the guidelines," the city said.
The hometown tax donations to the city of Setouchi in the fiscal year 2018 came out to be about 430 million yen.

Driving in high heels is dangerous!
Many accidents occurring when young people press the wrong pedal (Auto Messe Web) - Yahoo!News
Actions that violate the road traffic act
Although reports of car accidents caused by errors like pressing the wrong pedal are increasingly garnering attention, it is a big mistake to think that this is only a problem caused by elderly drivers.
Looking at the number of accidents caused by pressing the wrong pedal by age group (2015 National Police Agency data), the group with most occurrences was the under 24s at 1080, which exceeds the 1032 cases caused by over 75s.
It cannot be said that erroneous pedal presses are more common in older people, and so it is important to urge younger people to be careful in the same way.
Do you choose to make your feet look good?
Or do you choose safety?
Although this data does not include the gender ratio or the cause, unlike the elderly, where accidents are likely to be caused mainly by physical decline that affects driving ability and reflexes, with the younger generation it is more likely to be careless mistakes because of being distracted by music or conversation, or clothes than tend to be the cause of erroneous pedal presses.
Amongst women in particular, there are people who tend to choose footwear such as high heels, pumps, sandals and mules depending on their outfit, and drive as they are.
Of course there are those who are aware that they are not appropriate for driving in but find it a pain to change their shoes, but the majority drive without any bad intent but don't give any thought to the possibility that it may lead to danger.
However, driving in high heels or in sandals is actually in violation of the road traffic act.
One such law is article 70, about safe driving obligation, which states drivers must "work the vehicle's steering wheel, brakes, and other equipment in a consistent manner," and "must drive in a manner that poses no hazard to others".
Another is article 71, on rules set by the public safety commission that must be observed by drivers, which stipulates that drivers must follow the rules set out by the public safety commission of each prefecture, for instance in article 12 of the Miyazaki Prefecture road traffic act bylaws, which states, "it is forbidden to drive a vehicle (excluding light vehicles) in wooden geta sandals, slippers slip-ons, high heels or any other footwear that might impede operation of said vehicle, or wear footwear in a way that might impede operation of the vehicle."
The same is true in all prefectures, even if high heels are not explicitly stated, driving in "footwear that may impede operation of the vehicle" is considered a violation.
So, why is driving in high heels dangerous?
It is clear when you think about the basics of safe pedal operation.
In order to use the pedals safely, one must first place one's heel firmly on the floor, with the foot perpendicular to the brake pedal, pivoting the end of one's foot to the right when one wants to press the gas pedal.
Regardless of the behaviour of the car, it is imperative at this time that one's heel remains firm so that it does not wobble.
However, with high heels, the surface area of the part of the heel that makes contact with the floor is small, causing constant wobble, and the height of the heel means that the whole foot is at an angle, and so the surface area of the end of the foot that makes contact with the pedal is also small, making it hard to press the pedal firmly or make minute adjustments.
This is considered to be dangerous.
Another consideration is the fact that most cars have carpeted floors and high heels can easily get caught in the material, and there have been instances where someone has needed to brake suddenly but their heel gets caught and they're not able to press the pedal firmly enough, or even slip off when it gets caught and become jammed at the back of the pedal so that it can't be pressed.
There have also been cases where the heel has got caught on the other side of the pedal after pressing down and lifting off, and so the gas pedal wasn't able to be returned to the idle position.

US to cut number of refugee admissions for third consecutive year New record low at 18,000 Shizuoka Shimbun @S
[Washington, Kyodo] The number of refugees the United States will admit from the world in the fiscal year 2020 (10/2019-9/2020) will be cut to 18,000 at the most, the US state department announced on the 26th.
This marks the lowest refugee cap for the third consecutive year since the enactment of the Refugee Act in 1980.
Looking ahead to next year's presidential election, the Trump administration aims to appeal to conservatives with strict immigration/refugee policies.
Amidst the never ceasing numbers of forcibly displaced people in the world, criticism by human rights organizations is inevitable.
For the fiscal year 2017, the Obama administration set a cap at 110,000, and the Trump administration subsequently cut that to 50,000, after taking office in January 2017.
It has reduced the refugee cap each year, setting it at 45,000 for the fiscal year 2018 and 30,000 for the fiscal year 2019.

D-8: The torch of the 100th national athletics championships is lit on the Liancourt Rocks - Korea (Central News Japanese version) - Yahoo!News
The torch signalling the 100th national athletics championships was lit on the easternmost tip of the Liancourt Rocks (Dokdo, Japanese name: Takeshima).
On the 26th at 6:30am, Seoul held a torch-lighting ceremony for the national athletics championships on the helipad of the Liancourt Rocks Garrison in Ulleung County, North Gyeongsang Province.
It is 15 years since the torch of the national athletics championships was lit on the Liancourt Rocks, the last time being in Chungbuk in 2004 for the 85th championships.
Following a kite-flying performance to pray for peace, Kim Saeng-whan, vice-chairman of the Seoul Metropolitan Council, read out a statement.
Vice-chairman Kim declared, "We stand here today on Dokdo to honour the strong will of people's self-determination as we remember 99 years of the national athletics championships," and continued by saying, "100 years ago saw us make glorious history as we proclaimed independence during the March 1st Movement and then established the government of the Republic of Korea, and I would like to add the 100 years of the national athletics championships to that history."
This was followed by a speech from the head of Ulleung County.
Kim Byungs, head of Ulleung County, said, "Recently, Japan has made our economy tough for no reason and they claim that Dokdo is their own territory," adding, "We need to come together as one through these national athletics championships in order to overcome this."
Thereupon Vice-chairman Kim and County Head Kim lit the torch together.
The torch was passed to Jo Sung-ho, leader of the delegation and director of the sports promotion department in Seoul, who presented it to the first runners, Liancourt Rocks Garrison Commander Ho Won-seok and Officer Oh Yoseb.
The torch-lighting ceremony on the Liancourt Rocks was due to take place on the 21st, but was postponed as Typhoon Tapah was heading north.
Commander Ho Won-seok, who has been working on the Liancourt Rocks since January, said, "It's lonely and hard work, but I am working with pride because not just anyone can protect our territory," and went on to say, "I am honoured to be able to participate as a torch relay runner on Dokdo as we celebrate the 100th anniversary of the national athletics championships."
Commander Ho carried the torch from the helipad to the centre of the island before passing it on to Officer Oh, who took it as far as the harbour.
The torch was transferred to Ulleung-do, and at the bridge that connects it to Gwaneum-do, Kim Seung-ho, a citizen from Ulleung County, and Ulleung County Head Kim took part in the relay to take it to Seoul.
The torch relay began on the 22nd at Chamseongdan Altar on Ganghwa-do.
Since this marks the 100th time, the torch relay will be the biggest one ever.
The torch from Chamseongdan Altar on Mount Manisan will go around Incheon, Goyang and Suwon.
The torch from Ganghwa-do went round Imjingak, Mara-do and the Liancourt Rocks, then on the 29th of this month, when all the torches are united in Seoul Plaza, they will be let off as a single firework.
Meanwhile, Seoul's mayor, Park Won-soon, stated in a media briefing on the 25th that, "Now is a time when the power of collective intelligence is more important than just a few heroes," going on to explain, "That is why we decided on the concept of 'many stars' for the national athletics championships."
Korea-Bulgaria summit meeting leads to talk of further cooperation on issues such as nuclear power and defence industry (Yonhap News Agency) - Yahoo!News
Seoul, Yonhap News Agency: On the 27th, Korean President Moon Jae-in met with Prime Minister Borisov of Bulgaria, in Korea on an official visit, and they spoke in the Blue House (the presidential palace), during which they discussed plans to substantially increase the cooperation between the two countries.
This is the first time a Bulgarian prime minister has come on an official visit to Korea.
President Moon welcomed the PM ahead of the 30th anniversary of diplomatic relations next year, highly praising Borisov's leadership as he guides Bulgaria's development.
Both leaders recognised the merits of the continued increase in trade and investment between the two countries as protectionism is expanding worldwide, and agreed to continue to work together to increase economic cooperation.
President Moon welcomed the plan for Bulgaria to grant Korean companies with the status of "strategic investor", and said that he hoped that this would encourage Korean companies to invest in Bulgaria.
Furthermore, as Bulgaria seeks to introduce nuclear power and modernise it national defence, Moon shared the conviction that Korea would become the perfect partner for Bulgaria, and called for interest and cooperation so that Korean companies could take part in planning when the Bulgarian government places orders for nuclear power facilities and develops its defense industry.
In other areas, the two leaders also agreed to strengthen future-oriented cooperation in the fields of car parts and batteries for electric vehicles (EVs) as well as renewable energy.
Prime Minister Borisov expressed the hope that they could cooperate closely in ICT (information and communication technology), science and technology, education and other areas in which Korea is a leading player.
They also discussed the peace process on the Korean Peninsula, and President Moon expressed his gratitude for the support Bulgaria has shown in the efforts of the Korean government to establish peace on the peninsula, such as declaring support for the North-South Korea Summit and North Korea-United States summit.
Prime Minister Borisov praised President Moon's determination and the efforts of the Korean government towards peace-building on the peninsula, and reiterated the Bulgarian government's commitment to support Korea.
Also present during the discussion were Seung Yun-mo, Minister of Commerce, Industry and Resources; Yi Ho-sun, economic secretary general of the Blue House (the presidential palace); and Kim Hyun-jung, second deputy of the national security office.
Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha was visiting the US, so Cho Se-young, a vice-minister from the foreign ministry, attended on her behalf.
Kinki Ceramics, makers of Awaji tiles, a local industry in Hyogo and Awajishima, has filed for semi-voluntary bankruptcy with debts around 2 billion yen (Teikoku Databank) - Yahoo!News
The slump in the housing market combined with more consumers losing interest in tiled roofs after repeated damage from earthquakes were a contributing factor
Kinki Ceramics Co., Ltd. (TDB company code: 530173983, capital: 99.2 million yen, address: 881-8 Otani, Awaji-shi, Hyogo-ken, CEO: Fukuhara Kozo, employees: 44) filed for semi-voluntary bankruptcy at Kobe District Court on August 30th.
The application was filed by attorney Yoshida Daichi (Yoshida Daichi Law Firm, 1-10-8 Nishi-Tenma, Kita-ku, Osaka-shi, Osaka-fu, telephone: 06-6365-6038) and one other person.
The company is a tile manufacturer that was founded in June 1895, and reorganised as a corporation in April 1961.
Initially named Kinki Yogyo Co., Ltd. it started business as a manufacturer of ibushi tiles, a local industry of Awajishima, located in Seidan-cho, Mihara-gun (present-day Minami-Awaji).
In October 1986, the company merged with Kyowa Ceramics Co., Ltd. and took over the business of Kinki Sangyo Co., Ltd., changing to its current trade name and moving its head office to the current location in the process.
Kinki Ceramics went on to open sales offices in Fukuyama, Hiroshima, Oita and Miyazaki, taking on its current company structure, and while ibushi tiles were once their main product, changing customer needs meant that were manufacturing 70% western, flat tiles and only 30% of their output was Japanese tiles like ibushi tiles.
The company had built a broad customer base primarily in West Japan, including major house builders, building material trading companies and roofing companies, posting annual sales of 3 billion 116 million yen in December 2004.
They had been well known as a top tile manufacturer in Awajishima.
However, after this, demand slowed due to the downturn in the housing market following the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers, as well as consumers becoming less eager to have tiled roofs after repeated damage from earthquakes such as the Tohoku earthquake and tsunami and the Kumamoto earthquake, and so, by December 2018, sales had fallen to 1 billion 345 million yen.
On the profit front, not only did a sudden jump in fuel prices wipe profit margins, high interest-bearing debts associated with capital investment and inventory costs led to the company being constantly in the red, and they found themselves pretty cash-strapped.
As a result, Kinki Ceramics had been trying to rebuild its business by requesting financial institutions to ease the terms of loan repayments, but with no sign that business conditions would recover, cash gradually became tighter and tighter.
It got to the point where the company could no longer be shored up, so they abandoned hope of continuing business and took the recent action.
The amount of debt is currently being looked into, but it is expected to be about 2 billion yen.
Prefectural Dinosaur Museum in Katsuyama City, Fukui Prefecture which promotes the "industrialization of tourism" (Japan Aerial Shoot -- photographed by small unmanned drone)
Katsuyama City, Fukui Prefecture, announced on September 25th that it will acquire 25,3000 square meters of land (in the City's Arado-cho) adjacent to the construction site for the roadside station "Dinosaur Valley Katsuyama" which will open next spring.
In order to accelerate the "industrialization of tourism" which the City and local business community advocate, they aim to attract specialized lodging hotels and restaurants.
The director gave an explanation at the City Council Special Committee for Development of Tourist-Attracting Centers.
In addition to the Hokuriku Shinkansen line opening in the prefecture in 2023, the City is also focusing on the opening of all sections of the Chubu Jukan Expressway within the prefecture and the expansion and functional enhancement of the Prefectural Dinosaur Museum (Katsuyama City), and is hoping to advance the transition from day-trip focused tourism to overnight stay tourism and attract lodging facilities.
What they have acquired is the vacant land on the East side of the construction site for the roadside station.
Surrounded by the Kyuzuryu River, the Takinami River, and the prefectural highway, the area is about twice the size of the roadside station (which is roughly 12,000 square meters).
Under the title of industrial park development the City Land Development Corporation will proceed with land negotiations this year and, after the land purchase, clearing of the plot will occur in 2021.
According to the city they have been approached by private businesses to pursue farm restaurants with facilities for agricultural harvest experiences, fast food and other eateries.
As for lodging facilities, it has been announced that the City listed itself interested in the invitation from Sekisui House, which is planning specialized lodging hotels adjacent to roadside stations throughout the country.
Sekisui House plans to proceed at three locations within the prefecture, but multiple municipalities have expressed interest and there may be competition.
In addition, the City is making a plan for the preparation of parking lots, etc.
Committee members voiced their wish to speed up as the "preparation schedule is slow" and drove home their opinion that "it be made sure their is no (unsold) land left unused."
Vice Mayor Mizukami Mikio said that by positioning it as a "Tourism-themed industrial complex" he "wants to bring the Prefectural Dinosaur Museum and Ski Jam Katsuyama to the forefront and promote the superiority of Katsuyama City," indicating his intent to put all efforts into attracting hotels.
Two finalist games will be played on September 28th, the seventh day of the Autumn Fukui Prefectural Hokushinetsu Regional High School Baseball Tournament held at the Fukui Prefectural Baseball Stadium.
It is an important game from which the winner will get a ticket to the Hokushinetsu Tournament.
It will be a face off between the only remaining seeded school, Tsurugakehi, and Hokuriku.
Tsuruga won a close battle against Fukui Commercial in the quarterfinals, and will clash with Usui who has ridden momentum through this tournament.
Tsurugakehi, who will appear in the first match, has advanced up until now by winning entirely called games.
The first match against Asuwa was a easy win with engaged hitting and pitching.
In the second match against Takefu Technical, Kasashima Naoki, who participated in Koshien this summer, took the mound showing the presence of an ace with 5 no-run innings and 9 strikeouts.
Even in the match against Mikuni in the quarterfinals the battling lineup made 15 safe hits, and they will face Hokuriku with flawless preparedness.
[Team Introduction] Tsurugakehi -- Koshien battery-focused
Their opponent, Hokuriku, is gaining momentum with each successive match.
In the first round against Fujishima there was a turn around at the end of the game and they made it through with a one-point difference.
In the second round they brushed off the pressure as Mitaka gained on them and won with the same one-point lead.
In the quarterfinals the battling lineup was explosive and they defeated the seeded school, Sakai, in a called game.
They have been engaged in both hitting and pitching and in this flow they want to get the ticket to Hokushinetsu.
[Team Introduction] Hokuriku -- A batting lineup of hidden explosive power
Tsuruga, appearing in the second match, won playing defensive baseball centered on the battery.
In the first round against Wakasa the pitcher held out, winning with the least number of allowed runs.
In the second round against Takefu there were 2 runs allowed.
In the quarterfinals it was a close 10-9 battle against the seeded school Fukui Commercial, but defeating the high-ability school likely strengthened their confidence.
They want to use defense as their weapon to wrest a victory in the match against Usui as well.
[Team Intrduction] Tsuruga -- Chance for victory in the battery
Meanwhile, Usui defeated the seeded school Fukui Tech University Fukui in the first round.
Riding the momentum, after a rough progression, one stroke of the fourth batter won a comeback victory in the match against Kanazu.
The center-lineup hitters will be a focus in the semifinals as well with the coach also remarking "they have destructive power."

"Messi the Second" from Israel signs with the ninth club of his career (SPORT.es) - Yahoo!News
Gai Assulin joined Barça when he was twelve, and his frequent displays of style and brilliant plays earned him the nickname "Messi the Second".
Time has passed and Gai Assulin, now 28, has just joined a new team, making it the ninth club in his professional career.
Hidden talent of the pearls of cantera
As Ansu Fati is garnering attention, there are still many falls from grace in the football world, yet there is a perfect example of the old adage "there is no need to rush".
Though extraordinarily gifted technically, Assulin was abandoned by the luck he needed to succeed, so he ended up signing a 2-year contract with the Romanian team Poli Iași, who play in Liga I.
The team, whose colours are blue and white, are currently fifth in the league.
Gai Assulin made his professional debut with Barça in the 2009/10 season when he was just 18 and a half, playing against Cultural Leonesa in the Copa del Rey.
However, at the end of the season, his contract with Barça was terminated, and Assulin set off on a long journey.
He never stayed with a team for more than two seasons.
From Manchester City, he moved to Brighton and Hove Albion (on loan from City), then Racing de Santander, Hércules, Mallorca, Hapoel Tel Aviv, Sabadell and Kairat Almaty, and now Poli Iași is the new club giving the Israeli-born midfielder the opportunity for a fresh start in his career.
35% of local governments independently strengthens safety measures of Family Support Center Programs As childcare scheduled to become free of charge Shizuoka Shimbun @S
Press conference regarding ”Family Support Center Programs” survey results, by childcare accident victim's surviving family (right). Afternoon of 27th at Osaka Prefectural Office
On the 27th, a private survey said 35% of municipalities implementing "Family Support Center Programs," where the government matches parents who want to leave their children temporarily and support members who keep them at private homes, strengthened their own safety measures.
Before the programs become subject to provide free, early childhood education/childcare in October, surviving families of childcare accidents have complained that the government should set strict standards.
"Network to Eliminate Serious Childcare Accident", a group formed by parents who lost their children at daycares and specialists, surveyed 921 local governments.
274 local governments answered.
The implementation guideline released by the government only requires support members to attend an emergency first aid course.
Darvish reflects on the season: "It's on a whole other level than anything that's come before" (Tokyo Sports Web) - Yahoo!News
Published in St. Louis, Missouri on the 27th (28th local Japan time)
With the chance to play in the playoffs now quashed, Cubs' pitcher Darvish Yu (33) has finished pitching for this season, and he said in a recent interview regarding his current state of mind, "I've been doing nothing for the last two days or so. Just watching baseball (from the bench) without any objectives is boring."
Darvish started in 31 games this season, with six wins, eight losses and an ERA of 3.98, with 178 2/3 innings pitched and 229 strikeouts.
He exhibited a stable pitching form particularly in the second half of games, using superb control and overwhelming throws to make light work of batters on the opposing teams.
"Right now, without a doubt, I'm on a whole other level compared to anything before. I didn't expect to feel that way at 33. In the spring, I thought, 'I wonder if this is how it will end for me', so I can barely believe that I was able to come and move to a better position," which just goes to show that it was also a fulfilling season.
It was around the beginning of June that Darvish finally began to feel the effect.
"The things I was able to do increased each day, I was able to do an additional thing each day," he said.
There was a fair amount of trial and error, but by testing out hypotheses Darvish had made one after the after, he was able to significantly improve his situation, and his results improved accordingly.
He also asserts the fact that was able to "throw for the whole year without going on the injured list" was linked to him regaining confidence.
Darvish, who has the right to opt out and break from his contract after this season is over, noted, "I'll have to start thinking about it. I also need to talk it over with my agent and family," though he conceded, "Basically I've got nothing against this team, and I'm enjoying myself."
Although he has not reached a final conclusion, it seems his feelings are firm.

Children enjoying Omachi's soul food, "Taromen," after returning from a bath -- Omachi Town Misato General Welfare Center
The "Taromen Management Council" (Represented by Suzuyama Kensuke) which is an affiliate of shops that serve Omachi Town's famous ramen, "Taromen," handed out "Taromen" on the night of the 25th at the Town Misato General Welfare Center which has become a evacuation site for victims of the torrential rains.
The soul food, beloved since the days of the Kishima Coal Mine, gave a boost to those who had been affected.
"The only thing we can do is make and serve Taromen."
Four eateries that have Taromen on their menu participated by making 90 servings, which they delivered to the evacuation site along with rice balls.
Veggies, pork kashira (head), meat, shrimp and other toppings were piled on generously to udon noodles in the ginger and beef-bone soup.
Not only those who had evacuated to the center, but also people who had come to the baths set up by the Self-defense Forces were offered a "taste of Omachi."
"I've been a fan since I was young, but it's been a year since I've eaten it. I remember the past," said one man (age 66) and 20 and 22-year-old siblings who had just moved in one year ago said "This was our first time having it. It's tasty. Next time we'd like to to go to eat it at a restaurant."
When he finished cooking, Deputy Representative Fujise Kenichiro rushed in, sending his well-wishes and saying: "If there's anything we can do to quickly get things back to normal, we'll join in."
One year since Iburi Eastern Earthquake -- Installation of "water taps" connected directly to water pipes to ensure water access even in power outages continues in Hakodate apartments : Hokkaido Shimbun Doshin Digital Edition
Measures continue to be taken within Hakodate City at apartment complexes where water cut-offs occurred when the area suffered area-wide power outages (blackouts) in the wake of the Iburi Eastern Earthquake in September of last year.
According to the City Enterprise Bureau Water and Sewage Department, in the one year following the earthquake seven apartment complexes have been fitted with "water taps" that can provide water even during a power outage.
The bureau is calling for measures to account for the roughly 400 apartment buildings and non-government residential complexes within the city that are over 4-stories tall and access water via "water tank type" systems that could potentially suffer water cut-offs during power outages.
Water supply systems for residential buildings can be divided broadly into two types: "water tank type" which stores water in a tank either on the roof or underground, and "direct type" which connects each unit with water directly from the city water pipes.
With water tank type systems, if function of the electric pumps which direct water from the tank to each unit is halted due to a power outage, water cannot be accessed and a water outage occurs, even if there is no damage to water pipes.
Search and rescue training (Aomori) (Aomori Broadcasting Corporation) - Yahoo!News
Just as the autumn mushroom foraging season is about to get underway, a special search and rescue training exercise for finding people lost in the mountains was held in Shingo-mura.
Sixty people participated in the exercise at Takkozawa Forest Park in Shingo-mura, with participants ranging from the police and fire service to local hunting club members.
At the opening ceremony, Chief Tsukida of Gonohe Police Station called for "tight cooperation in the training exercise".
Announcement by Regional Director Takahashi: "The mountain search and rescue training exercise begins now"
The training was conducted on the premise that a man who gone foraging for mushrooms had not returned home by the evening.
The participants divided into three search parties and searched the mountain while calling the name of the missing man.
In Shingo-mura in June, a 70-year-old man who had gone up into the mountain to pick edible wild plants went missing and was found injured the next day.
During the training exercise, participants ensured that they were acquainted with the cooperation necessary to find an injured man and bring him down the mountain on a stretcher, in readiness for the autumn mushroom foraging season, when it is all too easy to get lost.
Nishijima Hidetoshi drunk at drinking party with the team from Ninkyo Gakuen?
Fantastic teamwork displayed during the speech on opening night (Movie Walker) - Yahoo!News
The opening night speech for Ninkyo Gakuen, a big screen adaptation from Konno Bin's popular "Ninkyo" series of novels, took place on September 27th at TOHO Cinemas Shinjuku, and Nishijima Hidetoshi, Nishida Toshiyuki, Ito Atsushi, Nakao Akira and director Kimura Hisashi all took to the stage.
Konno, who penned the original, was there as a special guest and he gushed, "I love this movie! Himura (played by Nishijima) is just so cool in whatever scene, whatever cut, he's in. I'm so jealous," and the cast members looked delighted to hear his enthusiasm for the film version.

A snapshot of the opening night speech for Ninkyo Gakuen
The film is a thrilling story in which the boss of the Akimoto-gumi yakuza, a man who can't help but contribute to society, accepts the task of saving a high school on the verge of collapse, and solving the various problems with the yakuzas' unique sense of moral obligation and humanity.
Nishida plays the strong yet likeable boss, while Nishijima plays his faithful number two, Himura, who is always being exploited by the boss.
Speaking about the premiere, Nishijima said, "I had been dreading this day," with a face filled with emotion.
"The whole cast was a very close-knit team, not just on set, but even after filming, we often met and talked about all kinds of things," he said of the strong bond between cast members.
Ito chipped in, "We held review meetings, but no reviewing occurred, they were just drinking parties," and added, laughing, "But the fact that we were able to make that time ended up being of great benefit on set. Teamwork improved and motivation increased. Even after the film was a wrap, we've carried on regularly, and I have a lot of fond memories," which just goes to show what a precious time it was that they spent together.
When the conversation turned to drinking parties, Nishijima let slip a surprising truth.
He confessed that, "Whenever I reviewed with these guys, I always ended up drinking too much. There were many occasions where I only remember about half of what was going on."
Nishida interjected, "Your drunkenness is not noticeable to others, you looked sober, but you're telling me you were drunk? That's a great way to be become inebriated," he said with admiration, inviting laughter from the audience.
The filmed forged a great sense of team, and Nishida expressed his desire thusly, "It may become a series if it gets reviews. I'd like to enlist your help to turn it into a series," and Ito added that they'd all be keen to "make it into a series", while Nakao remarked, "When I saw the film, I was annoyed because Nishida sings. If it becomes a series, I'd like to sing next time," while director Kimura stated, "As far as I'm concerned it's already been decided that there will be a sequel," before the cast members were showered with applause.
Prefectural Fisheries Cooperative Chairman Nozaki "opening the discussion for move towards full-scale operation," Remarks also on discouraging ocean release -- Iwaki Minpo Official Homepage
Talks surrounding a move towards full-scale operations are taking shape in each region with regards to trial fishing operations off the coast of Fukushima following the Tokyo Electric Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Accident.
With prefectural cooperative leaders in attendance, a council of the Prefectural Fisheries Cooperative (Fisheries Cooperative Association Union) was held on the 27th at the Chuodai Iino Fishery Hall and Chairman Nozaki Tetsu stated: "I think that, as the Prefectural Fisheries Cooperation, we need to move in a direction towards full-scale operation. I want to gather the respective representatives and open a discussion."
At the council meeting, Fukushima's coastal marble rockfish, masu salmon and spotbelly rockfish, which have had their limited-shipment designation lifted, were approved to be officially added to the fish species viable for test-fishing operations.
There are two remaining target marine species: venus clam and common skete.
After the conclusion of the meeting, Chairman Nozaki met with reporters and emphasized that the period for starting full-scale operations is undecided.
Regarding treated water that had been purified since being contaminated by the Fukushima Nuclear Disaster he stated "Pretentious debates are a problem. My position opposing draining into the ocean remains unchanged," rejecting statements made by Former Environment Minister Harada Yoshiaki and Osaka City Mayor Matsui Ichiro.
Regarding the talks about full-scale operations, head of the Iwaki City Fisheries Association (Fisheries Business Association Union), Egawa Akira pointed out that "we need to listen to opinions from below," respecting the will of the association members.
The City Fisheries Association says they will reach a conclusion after the affiliated branch offices come together to hold a board meeting and have resolved each issue one by one.
"We have to have this discussion not only with fishing personnel, but also with the wholesale buyers," said Soma Futaba Fisheries Association Chairman Tachiya Hiroharu.
The Soma Futaba Fisheries Association received federal aid, and as seven new ships will be acquired next year, they state that "first of all it is important that we get back the amount of fish for catching", and established that along with talks for full-scale operation, they will think of environment maintenance.
Karatsu Tobacco Sales Association's on-the-street action for improving driving and smoking manners | Town Topics | Saga Shimbun News | Saga Shimbun LiVE
An Association member appealing to motorists to drive safely -- In front of Waseda Saga Junior and Senior High School in Higashijonai, Karatsu City
On the 26th, in conjunction with the "Autumn Prefectural Traffic Safety Campaign," the Karatsu Tobacco Sales Cooperative held an on-the-street campaign in front of the Waseda Saga Junior and Senior High School in Higashijonai, Karatsu City.
Roughly 10 association members and others participated, appealing to motorists to drive safely.
Participants handed flyers and ballpoint pens to motorists while asking drivers to "drive safely".
They also called for improved smoking manners and handed out portable ashtrays as well, encouraging the prevention of littering with cigarette butts.
The Association chairman, Kumamoto Fujio (age 80) said "There are many accidents every year (within the prefecture) and cases of road rage are also increasing. I want everyone to respect manners and use caution when driving."
Only a thin line between beauty and ugliness?
what is the image of a "snake" that overlaps with the beautiful girls in the work of Umezu Kazuo? (Magmix) - Yahoo!News
Do mysterious beauty and dark, brooding expressions share something in common?
Umezu Kazuo's Beautiful Girls Collection (Genkosha) was released in August 2019, and this book focuses on beautiful girls drawn by Umezu, who is perhaps best known as the leading author of horror manga, and has released many works into the world since the 1950s.
Pick up a copy of this latest book, and you once again appreciate the correlation between beauty and fear in Umezu's work.
Images: Is it the sense of darkness that make them so fascinating?
Beautiful girls from Umezu Kazuo's work (5 images)
There's a line in the preface to the Beautiful Girls Collection that says "The beauty of these women stands out in stark contrast to the fear and ugliness in the story's development and shocking scenes", but when a beautiful face becomes distorted, taking on an expression of hatred and malice... perhaps it is this contrast that makes the horror all the more frightening.
Snakes are a heavily featured keyword in Umezu's works, but a snake can be perceived as a "creepy creature" or something beautiful, depending on the person viewing it, so there are various interpretations.
Some people in the world like reptiles, while others simply can't stand them.
In the same way, a snake is an animal where beauty and ugliness are two sides of the same coin, depending on the emotions of the viewer.
Furthermore, these creatures have been worshipped as highly spiritual creatures since ancient times, and it is said that a house where a "white snake" has settled will have good luck.
Stories that take snakes as their subject are "The Snake Girl" and "Spotted Girl" from the 1965 "Mummy is Scary!" series.
Generally it is a beautiful woman with a dark secret that becomes a "snake woman".
If you were to put in modern parlance, you might call that kind of woman a "cool beauty"... I feel that this is a common feature of the beautiful ladies that appear in Umezu's stories.
Among them, Orochi, the main character of "Orochi", a story serialized in Weekly Shonen Sunday from 1969 onwards, is a beautiful female character who can be said to be representative of Umezu's work, but the fact that she goes into a deep sleep for 100 years at a time to maintain eternal life and eternal youth, and that she possesses other mysterious powers, somehow reminds one of a snake.
Seven international students from Xavier High School pay a visit to the mayor, Sanyo-Onoda | Ube Nippo Town Media Web
On the 26th, seven international students from Xavier High School (principal: Matsubara Hideki) paid a visit to Sanyo-Onoda's mayor, Fujita Goji.
The students spoke about what they wanted to do during their stay, and Mayor Fujita encouraged them to make the most of their time at the school.
The students (aged 15-17) came to Japan from various Asian countries last month, as part of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology's Asia Kakehashi Project.
Six girls came from China, Cambodia, Mongolia, Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia, and they will spend eight months in Japan, staying in the school's dormitory.
A Turkish boy will spend 10 months at the school while staying with a host family.
The students visiting City Hall took turns to introduce themselves in Japanese.
When asked about their impressions of the city, one said, "Strangers greet you as you walk past. It's a quiet and pleasant town."
Another mentioned that they'd like to see Mount Fuji while they are in Japan.
The girls living in the dormitory also have the opportunity to interact with host families, and one of the girls said that she is looking forward to volunteering at the library festival.
Mayor Fujita told them, "I want you to get involved in lots of activities and experiences. You should invite your friends and host families to come to the city's Halloween event next month in Onoda Sun Park."
Deputy Minister Yamamoto deletes Tweet about meal the night before explaining cause of helicopter crash | Shizuoka Newspaper @S
A screenshot of the Tweet and accompanying photo of Iwata Kazuchika, the Parliamentary Vice-Minister of Defence, posted, and later deleted, by Deputy Defence Minister Yamamoto Tomohiro
As of the 27th, Deputy Defence Minister Yamamoto Tomohiro has deleted a comment he made on Twitter saying "This yakitori is delicious" after eating at a yakitori restaurant in Saga Prefecture.
Yamamoto arrived in the prefecture on the 26th in order to report to the local government the findings of an investigation into the crash of a JSDF AH64D combat helicopter that occurred in Kanzaki in February last year.
That same evening, he wrote "I've come to Saga Prefecture on a business trip tonight! " on Twitter.
He also posted a comment "it's delicious", with a photo of Iwata Kazuchika, the Parliamentary Vice-Minister of Defence, who is an elected official of the prefecture and was also present at the meal.

Koshiyama Wakasui - The circle of "Children's Diner" providing free or low-cost meals to children is growing across the nation.
According to the surveys of NPOs and other organizations, this year there are roughly 3,700 active locations.
This is a sudden 1.6 times increase compared to 2018, and within Fukui prefecture there are 24 locations, an increase of nine locations from last year.
Why children's diner now?
Social activist and NPO chairman Yuasa Makoto spoke about the background and significance at a lecture held in Sakai City.
With the declining birthrate and aging of the population areas are becoming desolate and shopping streets are declining.
There are no places where people can meet.
So "we needed a lively spot where people could interact in the area."
Although they are called children's diner, they are "places of multi-generational exchange" where the elderly can participate as well.
They not only eliminate the eating of meals alone, but also provide support for those raising children and promote health for the elderly.
Breaking the chain of porverty and rejuvenate the area.
The important thing is "to not make any child feel turned away"
Variety of locations ranging from those that provide meals once a month to those that provide meals daily.
The scale varies from a few people to a few hundred people, and the wide diversity of venues ranges from private homes to temples.
A mood is growing that people who want to do it, can do it.
This ease of getting started is an attractive draw.
However, it is difficult to maintain staff and operational fees.
Raised also is the issue of safe management structure
Nonetheless, "by interacting with many people your views on values change." "A connection with society becomes a security net in times of misfortune" Yuasa said.
Like a ray of hope in a closed society.

Eight new Air Force 1 models, including a Gore-Tex Model and a model made in collaboration with the NBA, released (WWD JAPAN.com)
In October, Nike will be releasing eight new models of its Air Force 1 sneakers, a shoe that has gained popularity as the brand's signature shoe ever since it first went on the market in 1982.
Three of the eight models are for women, about which Nike's senior creative director of women's footwear, Georgina James says, "Women are diverse, and so they seek something unique, something different to everyone else", and just as this would suggest, she has taken the experience gained from the One Re-Imagined collection (launched in 2018) that redesigned the sneaker from a female perspective and leveraged it in this latest update.
In photos: Eight new Air Force 1 models, including a Gore-Tex Model and a model made in collaboration with the NBA, released
The Air Force 1 NBA Pack, made in collaboration with the NBA come in two varieties: low-cut and high-cut.
The low-cut style comes in the NBA colours of red, yellow, black and navy, whereas the high-cut style are available in the uniform colours of three teams, including the LA Lakers.
In addition to the NBA logo featured on the heel and tongue of the shoes, satin fabric is used at the rear of the upper, and this is also the first time the Nike Swoosh has featured a bicoloured design.
The shoes will be released on October 1st, priced at 13,200 yen, tax included.
As its name suggests, the Air Force 1 Swoosh Pack design features the word "swoosh" as well as logos all over.
It is interesting to note that the tongue of the shoe, that would usually bear the brand logo, has also been changed to the word "SWOOSH".
The Air Force 1 Shadow draws inspiration from shadows, and so every detail from the side Swoosh onwards is doubled up to evoke a shadow-like effect.
The outsoles are thicker than the originals, giving the shoes more height, yet are made light by hollowing out the centre, which will surely appeal to women.
The shoes will be released on October 3rd, priced at 13,200 yen, tax included.
The true culprit that attacked a Saudi oil facility by drone (FRIDAY) - Yahoo!News
"The Iranian Ababil drone that was used in this latest attack has been improved dramatically in recent years after a crashed US military drone was analysed.
It can be manufactured at low cost and has a cruising range of about 1,000km.
It also has the advantage of being difficult to detect on radar because it flies close to the ground." (Yokota Toru, press photographer)
On September 14th, the oil facilities of Saudi Aramco, Saudi Arabia's largest oil company, were bombed by ten military drones.
Immediately afterwards, the Yemeni rebel group, the Houthi movement, issued a statement claiming that they were behind the attack.
"Behind the Houthis is undoubtedly Iran, led by President Rouhani. In a situation where it is unable to export its own crude oil, Iran cannot bear to see its enemy Saudi Arabia profiting from crude oil. Iran is trying to send a message to the world that if the oil embargoes placed on it continue, it will retaliate in equal measure." (Sugawara Izuru, international political analyst)
The bombing has cut oil production in Saudi Arabia by half, and caused oil prices to soar 15%.
Some say that if the situation continues, there will be another oil crisis.
"With Trump pledging to withdraw the US military from the Middle East, it will be best to avoid military intervention at all costs, at least until after next year's election. Knowing this, Iran will likely continue to run drone bombing raids hidden behind the Houthis. However, the US won't remain silent forever. It is very likely that Trump will decide to attack Iran in the future." (Sugawara)
The proxy war between the US and Iran is inviting an explosive situation.
The reason a super unique YouTuber became a full-time company employee.
Asking the company president who hired them (bizSPA!
Published 9/27 (Friday) 8:47
YouTubers currently boast immense popularity among young people.
Cases of companies hiring them for use in advertising the company's products are not rare these days, but there is one company that has started an unusual system of "YouTuber employment" in which they employ them as full-time company employees.
It is Direct Marketing Mix Inc. ("DmMiX"), a company that operates mainly in CRM (customer relationship management).
What exactly does it mean to "employ a YouTuber"?
We spoke with Kobayashi Yuki, DmMiX CEO and also representative of the subsidiary company Staff First, which actually employs YouTubers.
By employing YouTubers we want to encourage young people
-- First of all, how does "YouTuber employment" work?
Kobayashi Yuki (hereafter "Kobayashi"): These days the job of "YouTuber" is the dream of many young people.
It is even in the top of elementary school students' ranking of desired future occupations, and there will be more and more aspiring young people going forward.
Up until now we have employed young people chasing dreams of being musicians or comedians, and supported them.
In the same way, we employ young people chasing their dream to be YouTubers and support them, and that is "YouTuber employment."
-- When we say "YouTuber," the impression is of an individual who posts videos on their own, so why did you think to "employ" them?
Kobayashi: Though many young people aspire to the occupation of YouTuber, the reality is that most YouTubers can't make revenue the way they hoped.
There are many creators who create and post videos while also doing part time work, and creators whose families won't recognize them as YouTubers.
With this project we provide employed creators with a salary and an environment where they can create contents.
The cons of being a YouTuber as an occupation is that it is initially inevitably unstable, so I think that with the support of our company we can encourage their endeavors.
The environmental girl "fighting for a safe future" inspires protests around the world for the second consecutive week | Shizuoka Newspaper @S
Greta Thunberg (centre) participating in a protest in Montreal, eastern Canada, on the 27th (Reuters, Kyodo News)
From New York Kyodo News: Greta Thunberg (16), the Swedish girl calling for stronger measures to combat global warming, spoke at a demonstration in Montreal, eastern Canada, on the 27th, vowing, "We will never stop fighting for a safe future"
On this day, young people across the globe engaged in similar protests in countries in Asia, Europe, as well as America.
Large-scale protests occurring in response to Greta's call continue into the second consecutive week after starting on the 20th.
Greta met with Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau on the 27th.
Mr. Trudeau, who has always been keen to tackle global warming, participated in the demonstration march.
However, after meeting with him, Greta spoke harshly of Trudeau, saying that there was "obviously not enough action being taken".
"I hope South Korea returns to GSOMIA" says the deputy assistant US secretary of state (Sankei Newspaper) - Yahoo!News
Mark Knapper, deputy assistant secretary for Korea and Japan at the US Department of State, speaking in an individual interview with the Sankei Newspaper at the US ambassador's residence in Tokyo on the 27th said of the General Security of Military Information Agreement between Korea and Japan (GSOMIA) which is due to expire on November 23rd, "I hope that Korea reconsiders their decision to abolish the agreement and return instead."
It is unprecedented for a senior US official to refer to something like reconsidering the decision to abolish the GSOMIA.
The GSOMIA is concluded between Japan and Korea, Japan and the US, and Korea and the US and serves as a foundation for sharing intelligence such as information on missile launches.
Back in August, Korea announced that it would abolish its agreement with Japan, and once it expires, the framework that assures military intelligence will be shared between the two countries will collapse.
Knapper asserted that, "Without the GSOMIA, it won't be possible to respond effectively to a crisis."
"There is still time until it expires," he said, strongly urging Korea to return to the agreement.
The secretary also recognized the threat after China and Russia conducted a joint flight training exercise over the Sea of Japan in July, a "first in history", and appealed that, "The US, Korea and Japan share values such as democracy and human rights, and it is imperative that we operate together in an alliance."
He pointed out that the recent souring in Japan-Korea relations would "hurt the US national interest".
Although clarifying that he had "no intention of acting as a mediator", he hoped to "play a positive role so that Japan and Korea can bridge the gap".

Tokai Nuclear Accident 30th marks 20 years, 300 cases of trouble at nuclear facilities -- Hokkaido Shimbun, Doshin Digital Edition
The Nuclear Regulation Authority revealed on the 28th that over 336 accidents and breakdowns have been reported at nuclear power related facilities nationwide up until 2018 since 2000, the year after the Nuclear Criticality Accident in Tokai town, Ibaraki Prefecture, caused the first fatality due to exposure in the history of nuclear power in Japan.
The 30th marks the passing of 20 years since the Tokai Nuclear Accident rang an alarm over the nuclear industry's myth of safety.
Although in the report, 90% of the incidents were listed as either level 0 (Unimportant for safety) by severity measurements determined by the International Nuclear and Radiological Event Scale (INES) or were not subject to evaluation, there needs to be a constant heightening of safety awareness, by taking into account the lessons learned from the Tokai Accident and the 2011 Tokyo Electric Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Disaster.
Muneta Koichi completes story and art for original picture book, collects donations for publishing - September 18th, Echizen City, Fukui Prefecture
Artist and member of the Echizen City Region Revitalization Cooperation Volunteers, Koichi Muneta (64) will use a picture book to encourage town development and has started an online crowd-funding campaign to collect donations with the aim of publishing the original picture book which draws inspiration from legends from within the prefecture.
"The compassion of the people of Fukui is based in their deep faith and I want to convey that through the picture book" said Muneta, a Hokkaido native who started volunteering with the group in April of this year.
Donate Here - Expressing the heart of Fukui
While working as an artist focusing on contemporary art with mathematical motifs, since reaching his 60s Muneta also became active with the volunteer group.
Muneta started work with Echizen City last April after involvement in town development in Nagano, Kumamoto and Tochigi .
As the same city that produced Kako Satoshi and Iwasaki Chihiro, the city aims to utilize picture books to promote development.
Living in the city "I was surprised when I first understood the depth of the compassion of those around me," Muneta said.
Muneta was drawn to the Awara City legend, "The Daughter-in-law's Demon Mask."
In the story, when her mother-in-law is unable to remove a demon mask, a kind daughter-in-law is not frightened by the mask and without worrying repeats Buddhist chants to help her mother-in-law.
"To forget hatred and give compassion and kindness in return. I felt the origins of the deep piety and kindness of the people of Fukui," Muneta said.
After gleaning this hint Muneta started collecting research for his original picture book soon after arriving including visits to Yoshizaki-Gobo temple in Awara City and has completed "The Demon Couple," a story which features a gentle demon couple and a young boy.
Starting in June, Muneta put his professional skills to work painting ten warm watercolor scenes that will make up the material for the book.
Furthermore, the cover of the picture book is projected to be made from washi paper, utilizing a living traditional craft of Echizen City, Echizen Washi.
This will give parents and children an opportunity to enjoy the feel of washi paper while reading together.

Rugby lesson aimed at children in Niigata (Niigata Prefecture) (TeNY TV Niigata) - Yahoo!News
As the Rugby World Cup in Japan draws nearer and rugby is in the limelight, a rugby lesson for children was held in Niigata on the 28th to get children familiar with the sport.
The beginner's rugby lesson was held at Toyano Baseball Stadium, Niigata, on the 28th.
The event was organised by the Niigata Rugby Football Association with the aim of getting children familiar with the sport; 28 children aged from 3 to 12 participated and got to try the basics of rugby, such as tackling and passing.

Another beginner's rugby lesson will be held on October 19th.
Shoppers rush to buy before sales tax increase Special sales at retail stores in Okayama prefecture: Sanyo Shimbun Digital, San-Digi
Bic Camera Okayama Ekimae store where sales of large home appliances are strong before the tax increase
On the 28th, the last weekend before the sales tax increases from 8% to 10%, families crammed in last-minute shopping sprees at electronic stores and supermarkets in Okayama prefecture.
In efforts to increase sales, a hardware store set up a special bulk sale event and a suit store started selling winter clothing ahead of schedule.
Bic Camera Okayama Ekimae store (Ekimaecho, Kita-ku, Okayama City) has a special sale for a limited time until the 30th.
"Even if it's only 2%, you can't overlook the difference when you are buying an expensive item," said an Okayama businessman, 37, who was in the store to buy a refrigerator.
According to the store, sales of large home appliances such as TVs, washing machines and refrigerators have been booming since the beginning of September, and sales will be about twice that of the previous year.
”The rush demand is more than expected. In the second half of the month, more customers are buying big-ticket items," said a spokesperson.
Haruyama Shoji (Omotemachi, Okayama city), a suit store, has a sale entitled, "The biggest liquidation sale before tax increase".
Coats have been on sale since early September, one month earlier than usual, and sales are 10% higher compared to the same month last year.
"Though the ceremony is still a long way off, I would rather buy before the tax increase," said a businessman, 19, from Asakuchi city, who was in Kurashiki store (Hakuraku-cho, Kurashiki city) to buy suit for coming of age ceremony.
In this tax increase, most food and drink purchases are exempt because of the reduced tax rate system, therefore hardware stores and supermarkets mainly promote on everyday items and alcohol.
Time Takaya store (Kaneki, Naka-ku, Okayama city), a hardware store, has a special section with bulk detergent and tissue paper near the entrance.
Sales of everyday items grew 1.6 times compared to the same month last year, "We restock them many times a day, otherwise they would run out," said Shimizu Seiya, the store manager.
"Because it's something you buy anyway, I would rather take this opportunity to buy," said a government worker from Okayama city, 63, who was in the store buying paper towels in bulk.
Tenmaya Happy Town Okaminami store (Chikko Shinmachi, Minami-ku, Okayama city) has carts loaded with detergent, toilet paper, and disposable diapers at the event hall.
"The expense will be nearly the same after receiving cashless payment points, so I don't have to buy everyday items in a hurry," said a businessman from Okayama city, 35.
Best Manager of the Year 2019 Klopp praises his biggest rival as the "greatest manager" (SPORT.es) - Yahoo!News
Jürgen Klopp, who won the coveted title of Best Manager, looked back on his career in an interview and also commented on the current situation.
Of the many things that he said, one comment that was surprising to the public was regarding the Manchester City manager, Pep Guardiola, his biggest rival in the contest for the Premier League title.
Neymar's friend Alves speaks: "His happiness remains in Barcelona..."
After the awards ceremony, the German manager said, "I couldn't have imagined something so great. I am very happy, and proud to have won this award. The last couple of days have been simply incredible for me. It's all down to my players that I was able to win this award. My team is the most important thing."
Regarding Guardiola, Klopp divulged, "I highly respect him," continuing, "What can I say about him? He has won many titles. The style in which his team plays is extraordinary. He's the best manager I've ever played against, and it was an honour to be nominated with him and vie for the award."
He also mentioned Pochettino and Tottenham.
"His last year was unbelievably spectacular. In many cases, you don't remain in people's memories unless you win the title. But he's been slowly building his team, and they played with great style."
Asked about his best moment of 2019, Klopp answered without hesitation, "When we turned it round against Barcelona in the Champions League. Many pundits, including myself, would not have bet on us for even one centimetre. Behind three nil against a team that has Messi and Suárez...It's like a death sentence. We were afforded a small chance and managed to pull it off. I couldn't believe it. Looking back on it, I think you could say that we took command of the Champions League in that match. I'm sure that match will be remembered by everyone."
Finishing off with a more personal question, Klopp answered, "When I celebrated winning the Bundesliga, I woke up on a bench, and I didn't even know where I was. Nothing like that happened this time. I don't like getting drunk because I'm a man who has struggled with the obsession of self-control. The celebrations on winning the Champions League were very modest. I remember everything. For instance, if everyone was lined up in front of me right now, I might be able to discern all the people I saw from the bus."

Crafted into a special car that exudes personality and taste
Lexus will launch special edition models of its luxury coupe, LC, and sporty sedan, IS, on Tuesday, October 1st.
Photo: the interior of the Lexus LC, exhibiting fine quality
The special edition models were developed on the concept of "CRAFTED".
CRAFTED is an embodiment of the desire to produce new and exciting experiences by capitalising on detailed craftsmanship and cutting-edge technology, evoking the Japanese aesthetic sense that has been cultivated in its bountiful natural and historic setting and sensitivity towards vague things that cannot be put into words.
The special edition model of the LC, "PATINA Elegance", is based on the LC500/LC500h, and features Lexus's finest genuine leather L-ANILINE seat, which combines soft and natural texture and durability, plus a genuine leather steering wheel made from premium leather that is soft to the touch.
It has been realised as a model that exudes personality and taste.
For the L-ANILINE seats, only the highest-grade hides were selected, and achieves amazing softness through a lengthy softening process and a colour coating using a proprietary technique to achieve a thing coat.
It offers superior comfort by cradling the body, offering a great fit whilst driving.
Premium leather is also used for the steering wheel in a way that conveys the high quality to your fingertips.
Other details, such as the Alcantara roof, laser-etched metal parts, overlapping "L" motif beautifully embossed on the scuff plates and colour HUD have all been specially installed.
The interior combines a vivid patina brown made specially for the special edition model with vibrant browns on the door trims, genuine leather seats and seatbelts.
What's more, the stitching is two-toned, employing different shades of light and dark brown, which, when combined with the carefully selected textures, lends to the creation of a fine quality space with a sense of depth.
The body is available in three colours: Terrane Khaki Mica Metallic that was made especially for the special edition model, Sonic Titanium and Graphite Black Glass Flake.
I want to use Sidecar!
According to Apple, distribution of a new OS, macOS Catalina, will start in October.
The exact date has not been disclosed, but perhaps it will be distributed on October 4th?
(See all images) Release of macOS Catalina may be on October 4th?
The above image was posted on the Apple website in Denmark (at present it has been revised).
The words "From October 4th (fra den 4. oktober)" are clearly in the image.
As it is the official site, the accuracy of the information also would seem to be high.
Incidentally, the feature of macOS Catalina that I personally want to try most is "Sidecar."
This is a feature that treats an iPad as a sub-display for your Mac, a function that previously was achieved through third-party applications.
And, since Sidecar is a genuine Apple feature, it is expected that the level of polish (and response) will be excellent.
There are also rumors of the next version of the MacBook Pro equipped with a 16-inch display, but first I want to fully experience this next-generation macOS.
Sakura shrimp in the growing process Photographed at 290 meters deep Project with Shizuoka city Shizuoka Shimbun @S
Sakura shrimp born this year successfully photographed under the deep sea of Suruga Bay, off the coast of Kambara, Shimizu-ku, Shizuoka city on the 11th (Photo provided by "Yui Sakura Shrimp Project")
"Yui Sakura Shrimp Project" from the marine industry cluster committee, an academia-industry-government collaboration between Shizuoka city and others, has recently succeeded in photographing sakura shrimp born during this spring-summer spawning season on the 290-meter-deep ocean floor in Suruga Bay.
The images of the growth process are valuable, and officials hope they will help elucidate the mysteries of sakura shrimp.
The images were taken about 1.5 km off the coast of Kambara district, Shimizu-ku, Shizuoka city, near ocean floor.
About 300 shrimp were confirmed in a 17 minute span.
The conventional knowledge that Sakura shrimp spend the day in the deep ocean and "form a troupe in some degree on the ocean floor" was confirmed.
While the adult is about 40 mm, the shrimp photographed were about 23 mm long.
The spawning season was calculated by comparing the seasonal data of landed Sakura shrimp.
The project will ask its committee members, Fujitsu Software Technologies and Shizuoka College of Industrial Science and Technology to conduct a detailed analysis.
"We'd like to capture the vivid image of shrimp throughout their growing stages, Including young shrimp" Mizuno Keisuke, the project manager said.
Typhoon-ravished Mother Farm reopens, offering free entry to Chiba residents until end of October | Shizuoka Newspaper @S

[First half of the Olympic badminton race] World champion Momota Kento and Chou Tien-chen in good shape with a one step lead!
<Men's Singles> (Bado x Supi!
The Japanese representative won six medals at the 25th World Championships (Switzerland, Basel), the big event for badminton that took place in August, and after completing a training camp in the start of September they will participate in the China OP (Changzhou / Super 1000) which begins on the 17th.
Here, while looking back at May to August which started the first half of the Olympic race for a spot in the Tokyo Olympics, we look forward to the men's' singles in the upcoming mid-way games (September through December). (Text/Badminton Magazine editorial department)
The Olympic race for badminton started in May, and with the end of the World Championship, four of the high-level tournaments for top athletes (Super 500 and above) have been completed.
In the first half, the two athletes who were able to stay in promising condition were Momota Kento, who won 2 of the 4 tournaments, and Chou Tien-chen from Taiwan.
Momota won the World Championship, and Chou Tien-chen the Indonesia OP (S1000), both tournaments where athletes can earn a high number of "World Ranking Points" which are directly connected to the Olympic race.
Besides that, Momota is also won the Japan OP (S750).
The four tournaments he has been participating in since May are the Sudirman Cup team games (May, China), the Indonesia OP (July, resulting in the best 16), the Japan OP (July), and the World Championship (August).
Though this number is small compared to other top athletes, it is a schedule that puts less strain on his body.
In August, it was just the single World Championship tournament, so compared to consecutive tournaments surely the fatigue was not so large.
Good results are expected at the mid-way games which are the series of consecutive top-level tournaments held after September.
Ace of Taiwan, strong in consecutive matches.
Also look out for the young Thai!
Chou Tien-chen who similarly won at the top-level tournaments Indonesia OP and Thai OP (S500), has already appeared in 7 tournaments.
He took a magnificent win in his homeland at the Taipei OP (S300) at the start of September.
Already strong physically, he is also an athlete that does not struggle with consecutive matches.
Even with consecutive tournaments, there is no problem in his performance in the matches.
Conversely, since he was able to gain high points in the games of the first half his schedule likely becomes more flexible.
Until last year Chou Tien-chen gave an impression of lacking in explosive power, but since this year there has been an increased sense of stability in his plays and he has been able to maintain solid good performance.
For the first place world ranking holder Momota, this will be a trickier opponent than those up until now.
Other athletes besides these two that showed results in the first-half games were the young Thai ace, Kantaphon, and India's B. Sai Praneeth.
And Anders Andersen, fighting alone as the sole European athlete, making three athletes.
Although Kantaphon will not advance in the top-level tournament, he has been in the top four in two tournaments this season, and has the power to win against the top ranking players and advance.
He still has some rough spots, but the twenty year-old (will turn twenty-one on the 18th) who has grown able to rally equally with top athletes could be said to be a force hiding a large potential to jump into the Olympic race.
Also, B. Sai Praneeth has stepped out of India, which has many strong singles players.
Sameer Verma, Prannoy H.S., and Srikanth Kidambi who is lagging due to an injury, are likely to catch up, and we should turn our attention to the Indian athletes in from mid-games forward.
New fees for mobile phones: lowering rates in fair competition -- Hokkaido Shimbun Doshin Digital Edition
Mobile phone companies have released new rate plans coinciding with the enforcement of the Telecommunications Business Law revised this October.
However, they generally remained high.
Chief Cabinet Secretary Suga Yoshihide remarked last summer that "there is margin for a 40% reduction," and despite heightened expectations that rates would fall, no price competition occurred.
The major factor being, with the delay of Rakuten's full-scale entry into the market, that the three major companies continue to have a stronghold on the market.
For consumers, it is desirable to have easy-to-use rate structures that arise from fair competition.
We want to see an effort from the mobile phone companies.
The revised law prohibits set discounts for device fees and communications charges.
The reason being that, to compensate for device fees being sold cheaply, communications charges were being set comparatively high.
Softbank and KDDI (au) announced plans for half-price on devices.
However, devices from both companies were outfitted with "SIM locks" that made them unable to use other companies' networks for 100 days.
NTT Docomo will reduce the cost down to a maximum of one third on devices exclusively for customers who use their network.
It appears that all three companies are continuing to "cage in" to prevent transfers to other companies.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications pointed to a policy that would mandate immediate release of SIM locks.
Companies must also respond promptly.
Rakuten's postponement was due to the preparation of base stations and communication networks not proceeding as planned.
This was a disappointment as it had been expected to be a catalyst for low price competition.
Perhaps predictions had been optimistic.
The launch time and rate for full-scale service have not yet been disclosed.
As companies that play a role in social infrastructure, we hope they will be responsible in addressing their operation of business.
The current fee revision was spurred by Chief Cabinet Secretary Suga's remarks.
Secretary Suga expressed dissatisfaction regarding the three companies' new rates stating: "I believe competition will start from here. I in no way think it is fine staying the way it is."
However "government-prompted price cuts" will distort the market and it is difficult to think that it will promote healthy competition.
Companies should engage in customer-oriented competition before being told by the government.
Each company's fee structure is very complex, and it is not easy to compare them.
The Customer Affairs Agency advised caution as there are cases where customers end up covering more than the half price even though the devices are advertised as "up to half-price off."
Companies must provide thorough and easy-to-understand explanations to avoid misleading customers.
Three Mie Prefecture Shinkin Banks to lower ATM card withdrawal limit to 500,000 yen -- Ise Shimbun
To prevent damage from bank-transfer fraud, three Shinyo Kinko Banks in Mie Prefecture (Kuwana Mie Shinyo Kinko, Kitaise Ueno Shinyo Kinko, and Kihoku Shinyo Kinko) announced on the 26th that a reduction has been decided for the limit for withdrawals made by ATM card.
The maximum monetary amount that can withdrawn in a single day will become 500,000 yen for depositors aged 70 or older possessing an ATM card from Kuwana Mie, Kitaise Ueno or Kihoku Shinyo Kinko Banks who have not made a withdrawal over a certain amount at an ATM (Automated Teller Machine) in the last three years.
Kuwana Mie Shinyo Kinko and Kita Ise Ueno Shinyo Kinko Banks will implement the reduction on October 1st, Kihoku Shinyo Kinko on November 1st.
Within the prefecture, there have been repeated incidents of fraudulent ATM withdrawals made with ATM cards and pin numbers fraudulently acquired through false impersonation of financial institutions or law enforcement personnel, and a member of Shinyo Kinko stated "we want to protect the precious savings of our customers in any way within our means."

Rugby World Cup: Scuffling and instant sending off, US player's tackle that risked danger to the face causes ripples overseas as a "sneaky and disrespectful play" (The Answer) - Yahoo!News
A former England player said of US flanker Quill's rough play, "That can't even be called a tackle"
During the Rugby World Cup in Japan on the 26th, America, the last of the 20 nations to play, lost to England 7-45.
Although they were defeated, it was the rough play from flanker John Quill in the second half that is being talked about.
He shouldered an opponent in the face, which earnt him an instant sending off.
Actual footage of the incident was shared by overseas media outlets, and a former England player complained that is was a "sneaky and disrespectful play" and that it "couldn't even be called a tackle".
Video: The "sneaky and disrespectful play" and the ripples it caused overseas!
A red card, and players on both teams get into a scuffle...The actual moment of the tackle that risked danger to the face made by Quill
Unfortunately, hot fighting spirit caused him to cross the line.
It occurred in the 29th minute of the second half, with the score at 0-38.
England captain Farrell was deep in the opponents' half when he caught a pass from a player on his team that made him lose his balance a little bit.
It was at this moment that Quill went in for a tackle.
However, he did not go for the waist and below, but raised his upper body and smashed into the upper body of Farrell.
As a result, the two players' heads connected, as in a headbutt.
Farrell was sent flying and fell to the ground.
Another English player looked like he might lunge at Quill as he violently protested the clearly unjustified play.
Player from both sides quickly crowded around, and it looked like the situation might take a turn for the worse.
However, on consulting the television match official (who reviews the video footage), Quill was given a red card and sent off.
He left the pitch with an ashamed look on his face, but there was booing from some corners of the audience who expect fair play.
In New Zealand, a rugby powerhouse, local media outlet Stuff led with the headline "Rugby World Cup 2019: USA player sent off for cheap shot as England cruise to victory".
They reported that "Quill was sent off for a nasty shoulder charge to the face of England star Farrell", and "that sparked a scuffle between almost all players from both sides".
The article featured comments from commentator and former England player, Ugo Monye.
"It's a disgrace, it's cheap. That's not even a tackle. It's a cheap shot."
With one man down, the US managed to claw back one try in the 81st minute, avoiding a shutout.
However, Quill's play left behind a bad taste.
On September 26th the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare announced for the first time the names of 424 hospitals that have been deemed "of poor medical practice" out of 1455 public hospitals including Japanese Red Cross, and other government-run hospitals nationwide.
In Fukui Prefecture, the Ministry inspected the medical practice of 14 public and government-run hospitals and targeted the following four facilities: National Hospital Organization Awara Hospital in Awara City, Sakai Municipal Mikuni Hospital, Oda Hospital in Echizen Town and Wakasa Takahama Hospital in Takahama Town.
"Standards strange" four hospitals targeted for reorganization
The ministry took this unusual response citing a necessity to prompt hospitals in competing regions to organize and consolidate in order to curb medical expenses that are expanding with the aging of the population.
The idea is that requests for full-scale examinations of the reorganization and consolidation of the targeted hospitals be made in October, with conclusions provided by September of next year.
Though there will be no legal enforcement, opposition is expected from local leaders and residents uneasy about facing closures of nearby hospitals.
Publicly announced the same day.
Targeted hospitals made up 29.1% of the total, and many were hospitals that had a comparatively low number of beds.
In order, Nigata (53.7%), Hokkaido (48.6%), Miyagi (47.5%), Yamaguchi (46.7%) and Okayama (43.3%) had the highest percentages by prefecture.
By target numbers Hokkaido had the highest with 54, while Okinawa was the only with zero.
Of public and government-run hospitals, the Ministry surveyed 1455 hospitals capable of handling "highly acute stage" for severely ill patients and "acute stage" for general surgery based on 2017 data.
The necessity to publicly announce a hospital's name was determined by the performance review of its medical practice in nine categories such as cancer and emergency care along with whether a competing hospital was located "within 20 minutes by car."
Targeted hospitals will be asked to consider actions such as abolishing or moving parts of some departments to other hospitals.
In 2025 medical expenses will sharply rise as all baby boomers reach ages over 75.
For this reason, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare has set a goal to reduce the number of hospital beds nationwide from 1,246,000 (2018) to 1,191,000.
At present, while there is a large number of beds accommodating "highly acute" and "acute" phases that require heavy concentration of nurses and medical fees, there is a shortage of beds accommodating high needs rehabilitation among the elderly.
In response to the aging population it is not only necessary to simply reduce the number of beds, but also to increase accommodations for rehabilitation.
Regarding hospital reorganization and consolidation, a "community medical care initiative" will be formed in each prefecture to determine the number of beds, etc. that will be necessary in 2025.
Dividing the country into 339 regions, local governments and medical personnel are negotiating, but the debate has stalled as many local residents and leaders maintain a cautious attitude.
The Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare hopes the publication of the names of hospitals with poor performance will reinvigorate the debate.
Hypothesizing Komagatake eruption, first prefecture comprehensive disaster prevention training in 18 years spreads with residents participation (Video): Hokkaido Shimbun, Digital Edition
A disaster prevention training drill hypothesizing the eruption of Komagatake (1131 meters) was held on September 27th in Mori, Nanae and Shikabe towns in the Oshima jurisdiction.
The roughly 400 participants included residents and employees of 20 organizations including the prefecture and the three towns.
This was the first training since the Hokkaido Komagatake Volcanic Disaster Prevention Council formulated an evacuation plan complete with resident evacuation routes in August.
It has been 18 years since the last widespread training for resident participation.
The assumption was that Komagatake would erupt at 8:45 AM, and that mudflow would reach towns at the foot of the mountain.
When the eruption alert level was raised to level five (evacuation), evacuation shelters were opened for both Mori and Nanae towns and residents were transported by Hokkaido prefectural police vehicles or busses prepared by each town.
100,000 students skip school to call for stronger measures to combat global warming at climate demo in Vancouver (Minkei Local News Network) - Yahoo!News
Approximately 100,000 citizens, the majority of them students, who sympathise with 16-year-old environmental activist Greta Thunberg, took to marching through Vancouver on September 27th, in a bid to fight climate change.
View of the climate demo in Vancouver
The march started at Vancouver City Hall, then travelled across Cambie Bridge before finishing at the downtown library.
People with placards began to arrive at the gathering point in front of City Hall several hours before the start, and by the time the start time of 1pm came round, the number of people had risen to the point that they filled several blocks of road in front of City Hall.
The number of participants continues to increase even after this time, until at final count, over 100, 000 people participated.
Law enforcement officers cooperated and policed the roads along the way, keeping watch for several hours until everyone had walked the route.
To coincide with the United Nations Climate Action Summit that occurred in New York, various events have been held in Vancouver since last weekend, encouraging people to think about global warming.
On the final day, the 27th, a school strike was organised as "Fridays for Future".
The students who skipped school and participated in the demo on this day appealed to adults by saying, "We want to protect the Earth so much that we are willing to skip something as important as school," while in response, the many adults who also took time off to work to participate said, "We will do our best for the future of our children, who are studying and thinking about this issue in earnest."
Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries recommends swine fever vaccine for nine prefectures (Gifu Newspaper Web) - Yahoo!News
On the 27th, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries announced a proposed reform to the to the guidelines on preventing epidemics, making it possible to vaccinate pigs that are currently not allowed, in an effort to prevent further spread of swine fever.
The plan is to target nine prefectures where the infection of pigs and wild boars has been confirmed, such as Gifu and Aichi Prefectures.
The movement of live, vaccinated pigs and fertilized eggs is restricted within the area, but the distribution of meat and processed products outside the area is permitted.
After gathering public opinion on the matter, it is hoped to get the reform put through as early as October.
However, by using vaccines and allowing the distribution of meat outside affected areas, Japan may no longer be seen as a "free country" as certified by international institutions, which may have a negative impact on the export of pork.
Since the outbreak last September, Japan's status as a free country has been suspended.
In the proposed reform, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries has set out "areas where vaccination is recommended" based on expert opinion, which are areas where there is high risk of wild boar infecting pigs.
The target prefectures will develop their own vaccination program that determines the range of vaccination, vaccination period, number of animals to be vaccinated and how to proceed with vaccinations, then once it has been checked by the ministry, use of the program will be permitted at the discretion of each prefectural governor.
The other seven prefectures that have been recommended for vaccinations are Saitama, Toyama, Ishikawa, Fukui, Nagano, Mie and Shiga.
Once the guidelines have been revised, the situation will be assessed and the regions will be finalized.
In principle, the movement of live, vaccinated pigs, semen, fertilized eggs, carcasses and excrement is restricted within the area.
Meat and processed products are not subject to such restrictions due to the cost of restricting distribution and because of the impact it would have on farmers, so in effect, distribution outside the area is allowed.
Thus food waste must be thoroughly disposed of to prevent the spread of the virus.
Efforts will be made to ensure that vaccinated pigs are safe, and to prevent financial damage caused by misinformation.
The proposed guideline reform was compiled at a meeting of experts that was held on the same day, and approved at an assembly of the Epidemic Prevention Task Force.
The next step will be to hold public opinion enquiries in each prefecture until October 7th, after which the new epidemic prevention guidelines will come into effect.

Late at night on the 27th (Japan time) Honda updated his Twitter with the following message: "Please make me an offer. Money's not an issue, but I need to play with a great team and great teammates", approaching a certain club publicly.
And the club to whom he sent this "reverse offer" was none other than Manchester United, one of the most highly esteemed teams in the world.
So why did Honda make this spectacular request to one of the Premier League's most powerful clubs?
The answer lies in an article published by the Australian version of FOX Sports on the 24th.
In the article entitled "Five Free Forwards Manchester United Could Sign Amid Injury Crisis", it lists five players who are free agents and currently available to sign.
Honda was named, along with players such as Hatem Ben Arfa, Giuseppe Rossi and Wilfried Bony.
United is currently in a state of emergency after a spate of injuries to their players, including midfielder Paul Drogba, defender Luke Shaw, defender Eric Bailly, forward Anthony Martial and forward Marcus Rashford.
The "Red Devils", who are managed by Ole Gunnar Solskjær, have had a difficult start to the league with only two wins and 22 losses, and are facing issues in the quality of their frontline.
Thus Australian media named Honda as a fresh and capable candidate who could shore up their ranks.
The article notes that, "Not strictly a striker by trade, creative wide-man Honda's signing could fill the hole currently being timidly filled by Andreas Pereira."
It goes on to say that his nine goals scored in 18 games with Melbourne Victory was a "solid record", but points out that "Honda, 33, has to step away from his pastime of managing the Cambodian national team to earn full attention."
Will Honda's approach bear any fruit?
It will be interesting to see if United make a move for the veteran who has declared it his aim to take part in next year's Tokyo Olympics.
The Installation of 500 portable translation devices completed Hamamatsu Chamber of Commerce lend free to stores, etc. Shizuoka Shimbun @S
"Pocketalk," a portable translation device lent free to 500 locations, including stores in Hamamatsu City
The Hamamatsu Chamber of Commerce and Industry announced on the 26th that it has completed the installation of 500 units of portable translation devices to member enterprises such as stores in Hamamatsu city.
Since it is said to be the first of its kind in the country that the Chamber of Commerce distributes a great number of Pocketalk in one region, it will allow people to pay close attention to the project's success in meeting inbound tourists' demands.
Currently, the lending locations include 236 restaurants, 113 retail stores, 17 accommodation facilities, and 134 others.
Naka-ku, Hamamatsu city accounts for 60%.
It also started displaying the lending locations on the map app, "Google Maps," and the locations of "stores providing foreign language support" can be found on smartphones.
It can be accessed from the website of Lake Hamana Sightseeing Area.
The free lending of Pocketalk, which supports 74 languages, was started in April following the declaration of ”Hamamatsu, Japan's best inbound tourism support city" made by nine organizations in the city.
The Chamber of Commerce purchased 500 units and lends them for two years to small and medium-sized establishments that meet the requirements of hospitality certification and cashless payment implementation.
"Hopefully, this will lead to new foreign customer development despite of the difficult business environment," the Chamber of Commerce spokesperson said.
For someone skilled at the driver off the deck, is teeing up on the first hit unnecessary for Ikemura Tomoyo?
Caddy's shot of the day
A driver shot doesn't necessarily have to be hit off the tee.
On something like the second shot of a par five hole, when you want to gain some distance, there's also the technique known as the "driver off the deck", where you strike the ball where it is on the ground.
Modern drivers have large heads, so they do come with the risk of sending the ball flying off in the wrong direction, but there is a player who practices this technique frequently on the teeing ground.
It's Ikemura Tomoyo, tipped to win his first tour victory.
In his 7th year of professional golf, the 24-year-old has a diminutive stature at 1.66m, but he is currently seventh in terms of driving distance (hitting an average of 304.02 yards).
While long shots are his forte, one of the issues was the precision of the fairway wood.
Then one day in early spring, he was enlightened: "Since the spoon (three wood) shot wasn't working, I thought I would try the driver off the deck."
From the practice round, he would plop the ball down on the grass in the teeing area, and casually swing a driver at it.
At times when a big carry is required, the ball is often teed up, but Ikemura employs the driver off the deck for holes where both sides are narrow.
"It can be used for holes where the line of sight is downhill."
The trajectory tracker records a carry of 270-280 yards.
"So a three wood is not required. The caddy also said that a driver off the deck is safer than a three wood.
Since the Japan Golf Tour Championship in June, the only wood in Ikemura's caddy bag is the driver.
His second longest club is a utility iron with a loft of 17°.
This tactic has astonished his fellow tourmates, but has also caused rousing cheers from the spectators who witness it.
Apparently, the trick is to "swing the club level".
"Whether performing a down blow or an upper, it doesn't fly true. A cut shot will send it to the right. Originally, I was merely using the driver off the deck to correct the swing of the driver shot (when teeing up). This practice also gives it a gentler attack angle (the angle of incidence of the club)."
The ball is not gripped by the head of the club, incurring the risk of slicing it, but it "eliminates the left side (it doesn't curve to the left)."
It sounds easy when you say it...But one can't help but be impressed by this pro technique.

"This time I will attain love..." Shuri set to appear in the Fuji TV drama, "Ex-Enthusiasts: MotoKare Mania", starring Araki Yuko and Kora Kengo (Sports News) - Yahoo!News
Actress Shuri (29) has been cast in Fuji TV's new drama, "Ex-Enthusiasts: MotoKare Mania" (starting Thursday, October 17th, at 10pm), appearing alongside Araki Yuko (25) and Kora Kengo (31).
Shuri will play Kaga Chizuru, a colleague at the major food manufacturer where Yamashita Akio, played by Hamano Kenta (38), works.
Chizuru, an original character for the TV adaptation who does not appear in the original, has no interest in marriage, only seeing it as a means for one to not have to suffer financially.
And then along comes Yamashita.
Exhibiting great prospects as a rare of example of someone who was promoted to the Tokyo headquarters from Hokkaido coupled with an elegant way of eating, he becomes the "ideal marriage partner" and she approaches him.
Although Chizuru appears to have a strong mentality, she is actually soft like tofu.
Because she follows a relationship strategy where she won't get hurt, she becomes very agitated if things don't go as she expected.
The story charts how Chizuru, who up until now has been putting on a bold front, meets Yamashita and Yurika, played by Araki Yuko, and slowly begins to change through their shared encounters.
Shuri has previously appeared in the NHK drama, "Toto Neechan" (April to October 2016), TBS Television's "Black Pean" (April 2018), and many other popular titles, but this will be the first time that she has appeared in a Fuji TV drama for terrestrial television.
Speaking about the role, she said, "For some reason I tend to play characters that are unlucky in love, so I hope that this time I will attain [love] (she laughs). I want to have some fun playing Kaga Chizuru," she also had a message for viewers: "I'm really looking forward to seeing how the world of Ex-Enthusiasts: MotoKare Mania unfolds in the hands of the distinctive and fascinating cast and everyone involved with the production. I hope this drama will make you look forward to Thursday evenings at 10 o'clock."
It has also been confirmed that Okura Takato (17) will play Hattori Tsumugu, a new hire under Chizuru.
As the youngest of the regular cast members, Okura brings fresh and youthful acting to the production.

Akutagawa's posthumous handwritten manuscript exhibited for the first time Literary theory of deterioration and tragedy Shizuoka Shimbun @S
Akutagawa Ryunosuke's handwritten manuscript exhibited for the first time at the Tabata Memorial Museum of Writers and Artists
The Tabata Memorial Museum of Writers and Artists in Kita-ku, Tokyo, acquired on or before the 27th, the handwritten manuscript for the essay "Literary, All Too Literary 2" published in his later years by author Akutagawa Ryunosuke (1822-1927), who has been engaged in a literacy spat with Tanizaki Junichiro.
It will be exhibited at the museum from October 1st.
Though the existence of the essay was well known as being included in his complete collection, this will be the first time his handwritten manuscript is exhibited to the public.
It is believed that Akutagawa wrote this several months prior to his suicide, and Tanei Jo, the museum's curator commented, "It shows how Akutagawa, who had been debilitated both physically and mentally, committed himself to finding the answer to the greatest question in literature with tragic yet brave determination."
The 12 page essay, written on 200 character manuscript papers, was published in 2015, in the April issue of Bungeishunju.
Greta Thunberg wonders on Twitter "why adults choose to spend their time mocking and threatening teenagers and children".
Greta Thunberg, the Swedish environmental activist, gave a speech at the United Nations Climate Action Summit in New York on September 23rd.
While her speech has garnered attention, messages insulting Greta have also emerged from some quarters.
Collection of Tweets from Greta Thunberg: "I honestly don't understand why adults would choose to spend their time mocking and threatening teenagers and children"
A political commentator speaking about Greta on an American TV show said, "mentally ill child who is being exploited by her parents and by the international left" after which the television station that had interviewed him apologised.
Even in Japan, many comments online say things like "I feel sorry for her because she's just being used" and "She should be going to school", focusing on Greta herself rather than the content of what she is saying.
Meanwhile, on September 26th, Greta posted to her Twitter, "I honestly don't understand why adults would choose to spend their time mocking and threatening teenagers and children."
"They come up with every thinkable lie and conspiracy theory"
Greta started the thread with "Here we go again... As you may have noticed, the haters are as active as ever - going after me, my looks, my clothes, my behaviour and my differences. They come up with every thinkable lie and conspiracy theory."
She went on to point out that adults seem to have shifted the discussion because they don't want to face the climate and environmental crises, continuing the thread as follows.
I honestly don't understand why adults would choose to spend their time mocking and threatening teenagers and children.
They could do something good with that time instead.
I guess they must simply feel so threatened by us.
But don’t waste your time giving them any more attention.
The world is waking up.
Change is coming.
Whether adults like the change or not.
See you in the streets this Friday!
Last week on Friday the 20th, strikes for the climate happened in New York and other parts of the world.
Now, Greta is calling for further strikes to be held on Friday the 27th.

Akita Television's Programming Commission (The Sankei News) - Yahoo!News
The 432rd Broadcast Programming Commission for Akita Television (chaired by Ebata Kiyohiko) took place during which they discussed the show, "Delectable Akita Curry, Recommended by Editors, Pro Chefs and Celebrities!", that was broadcast on August 16th.
In the show, a number of topics were introduced, including a number of highly recommended curry restaurants, tips for how to enjoy professional flavours at home and the untold story of the birth of outstanding boil-in-the-bag curry.
While some commission members said, "It was simple, the concept and theme was clear," "I watched to the end with great interest. It had a good tempo, and they even showed curry bread" and "I was able to see them in a different light compared to on a restaurant listings site," still others were of the opinion that "The re-enactment was too long" and "I would have liked some pro tips on making curry".

Garcia's Wedge Shot
I was able to make it to some extent in the first half, so I thought I could go with that momentum in the second half, but I just couldn't get the putter to go well and couldn't make it further, so that was frustrating.
-- Could you see a victory with the eagle in the sixth and the birdie in the seventh?
After hitting the bogey on the fourth I had a whole 5 par remaining so I played wanting to take it back and then the chip in eagle came in the 6th.
I got the birdie on the 7th and there was a chance, but I regret that in the end I couldn't make it in the second half.
-- What did you get out of this tournament?
Recently my condition (of my shot) hasn't been good so it was good that I could keep solidly to the fairway even on a course where it was narrow.
It was a course where the rough was into-the-grain and against-the-grain randomly and one where the way of hitting and distance changes, so this was something I had not had much (experience) of before so I learned quite a lot.
-- What was the difference to regular tournaments?
(Smartphones and other) camera photography was allowed.
It didn't bother me at all, but there were a lot of people in the gallery taking videos.
There wasn't much else different besides that, but because it was a joint sponsored tournament with few Japanese athletes, I approached the match with the sentiment "I can't lose to the overseas players!"
The second half will start, but I can't aim for the top prize if I don't win one or more so I want to get one more win, and the ZOZO Championship is also coming up so to qualify I also want to do my best to get in the top ranks in the tournaments leading up to it.
How to prevent dementia and keep it at a merely "forgetful" stage?
Interview and story by Watanabe Yo
Major pharmaceutical companies and university hospitals are attempting to research and develop a drug for dementia, something that remains an elusive goal.
However, it's becoming clearer that dementia and lifestyle are related, and it has been discovered that it is possible to keep it at bay so that it does not advance past a merely forgetful level, and the symptoms are negligible.
I spoke to Professor Otsuki Shunsuke at the Kinki University Hospital Stroke Centre to find out more.
Dementia never fully goes away
A cure or prevention for dementia has been long-awaited, but what is the current state of progress?
Otsuki: As we age, it's possible for anyone to suffer from dementia, though there are varying degrees of severity, from mild to quite serious indeed.
However, it is thought that it will still take more than twenty years before a novel dementia drug is developed.
Donepezil, the drug commonly used in Japan, is already not covered by insurance, so we can't hope for it to be a miraculous cure.
Meanwhile, people can now live longer lives thanks to fewer deaths from infectious diseases and accidents, and deaths from cancer are also decreasing thanks to the startling progress that has been made in anti-cancer treatments.
Because of that, the fact is that cases of dementia are on the rise.
It's not a problem that can be solved by the individual and their family alone, it's also necessary for society as a whole to create an environment so that they can live safely in the community.
How to keep dementia at a "forgetful" level
Are there any kinds of people who are more prone to dementia, or who are less likely to get it?
Otsuki: Even if dementia is not completely avoidable, it is possible to suppress the symptoms to the extent that it is nothing more than forgetfulness.
Dementia is considered a lifestyle-related disease and there are certain trends among people who are more prone.
Firstly, overweight people are far more likely to get dementia.
Dementia is treated as a lifestyle-related disease.
It is a combination of obesity, high blood pressure, diabetes and high cholesterol.
Finances are also a factor.
For example, in some parts of the US, food stamps are given out to the poorer members of society, and the foods that you can receive with food stamps are things with a long shelf life such as frozen hamburgers, pizza and chicken.
They can be used by people who live in an environment where they cannot cook in the first place, because they don't have gas or electricity.
This results in a diet that is low in vegetables and protein, leading to an unbalanced lifestyle that is high in fat and sugar.
Eventually, they end up poor but obese, with nothing to do but tune out in front of the TV, and they become physically impaired.
I believe a similar situation could exist in Japan.
Also, people who don't have anything to think about, or who don't work, tend to be more prone to dementia.
In other words, it's important to not become obese and to read books and consider things regularly to stave off dementia.
PR for Okayama tourism and specialty products in Osaka: VR of Maki-do Cave also makes an appearance -- Sanyo Shimbun Digital | Sandigi
The "Land of Sunshine Okayama Bichu Marche" (Organized by the Okayamaken Bitchu Prefectural Bureau and others) promoting tourism and specialty products from the Bichu area began its two-day program at an open plaza at JR Osaka Station the on the 27th.
Niimi City, which was hit with localized torrential rains early this month, set up an experience area with a VR (virtual reality) of Maki-do Cave to appeal to the people of Kansai.
The seven participating towns and cities are Kurashiki, Kasaoka, Ibara, Soja, Niimi, Asakuchi and Yakage.
Station users stopped by the booths which included masking tape fan-making (Kurashiki City), denim keychain-making (Ibara City), and kaleidoscope-making fashioned after the observational telescope (Asakuchi City).
In the Maki-do Cave VR experience, visitors used specialized goggles to experience a simulated walk inside the cave.
A woman (age 52) from Itami City in Hyogo Prefecture remarked "When I turned to the left, I saw the scenery on the left, and when I turned right I saw to the right, and it really felt like I was walking inside. If I have a chance I would like to experience the real Maki-do Cave."
Takanofuji's brother Takagenji shows remorse for ignoring guidance | Shizuoka Newspaper @S
On the 28th, Takagenji, twin brother of the disgraced Juryo division sumo wrestler Takanofuji, who was urged to retire from the Japan Sumo Association after assaulting his personal attendant, has himself reflected on the disciplinary action for acting outside of guidance, saying, "I fully accept the decision. The next tournament will start not at zero, but at a minus position."
He was speaking in an interview after participating in a tournament at the Ryogoku Kokugikan Sumo Arena in Tokyo.
Takanofuji, acting on his own authority, held a press conference on the 27th, announcing his desire to continue as a wrestler.
Takagenji first learned of his brother's intention to hold a press conference when it was reported, and advised him not to do it, but said that he hasn't been able to contact him since then.
"Even though we were brought up in the same environment, my brother and I have different ways of thinking," he said.
First major improvements made to the Jaguar F-PACE, including the possibility of hybridization (Response) - Yahoo!News
A new, improved prototype of the F-PACE, Jaguar's first crossover SUV, was caught on camera for the first time in Southern Europe.
The F-PACE originates from the C-X17, a 4-seater concept SUV that was unveiled in 2013.
A 5-seater version was subsequently revealed in 2014, before officially debuting as the F-PACE at the 2015 Frankfurt Motor Show.
The first, and current, generation model went on sale a year later in 2016, and this will be the first facelift that it has received since then.
The photographed prototype is covered with dense camouflage, but some of the new design is visible.
In addition to more compact headlights with a sleek design, the side air intakes have also been modified to more sporty oval shapes.
The grill was completely disguised, but no doubt that it too will have been redesigned.
At the rear of the car, parts of the new taillights are visible, with elongated reverse lights placed above.
It also seems that the design of the current model, that sees the lights sweep round to the sides, has been modified to be more compact.
The inside of the car is expected to be kitted out with Jaguar's "Pivi Pro" touchscreen infotainment system, as well as a new digital cluster, HVAC control screen and a refreshed steering wheel and gear selector.
The powertrain options are likely to be a 2.0l straight-four turbo diesel engine or a 3.0l straight-six Ingenium hybrid engine.
We're sure to see the world premiere of this car before the end of 2020.
Revenue related to nuclear power plant construction suddenly increased after company offered 300 million yen to former assistant official | Shizuoka Newspaper @S
Kansai Electric Power's head office, Osaka, on the afternoon of the 27th (taken from a Kyodo News helicopter)
In the ongoing case where KEPCO's Chairman Yagi Makoto (69) and associates were found to have accepted money and goods from Moriyama Eiji (who died in March of this year, aged 90), a former assistant official of Takahama-cho, Fukui Prefecture, where KEPCO's Takahama Nuclear Power Plant is located, it has now been revealed that a local construction company which had offered 300 million yen to Moriyama has significantly increased its sales in recent years through construction orders related to the nuclear power plant.

According to the credit rating agency, sales for the month of August 2013 were 350 million yen, which rose to over 1 billion yen in 2015, and 2.1 billion yen in 2018, for the same period.
Construction related to KEPCO's nuclear power plant accounted for much of the work.
Reckless driver arrested in Kagoshima after threatening to kill another road user (KTS Kagoshima TV) - Yahoo!News
On the 24th of this month, a 33-year-old unemployed man was arrested on a national highway in Kagoshima after not only persistently tailgating another driver, but also allegedly threatening the man, saying that he would "kill him".

Onsarigo commented, gleefully, "The children ran well, and it was the perfect job for me to do."
The event was the 39th such event, and was organised by the city's Society for the Promotion of Primary School Physical Education, in order to encourage deeper friendships among 6th graders at different schools around the city.

Nishida not only acted in the film, he also appears on the soundtrack, singing an arrangement of "Until We Meet Again" with Tokyo Ska Paradise Orchestra.
Regarding this, Nakao said, "When I saw the film, I was annoyed because Nishida sings," consumed with envy.
But Nishida boastfully and frankly replied, "I've appeared on the Red and White Song Battle three times in the past. If it were possible, I would rather people call me singer rather than an actor. (You and I) are on a different level."
He also promised to perform live if the film continued to do well.

Hong Kong Kyodo News: On the 28th, marking 5 years since the beginning of the large-scale "Umbrella Movement" protests in Hong Kong that demanded democratic leadership elections in 2014, tens of thousands of people gathered in a park near the central government complex of Hong Kong in Admiralty (Kam Chung), where the largest occupation of protestors was in 2014.
Some young people occupied the main roads near the rally, and threw petrol bombs at government buildings.
As protests over the Fugitive Offenders amendment bill continue, many protesters renewed their determination to continue fighting until they can realize the genuine universal suffrage that they were not able to secure 5 years ago.
The latest round of protests got underway in a serious capacity in June, and have now been going on for 112 days, exceeding the 79 days of the original Umbrella Movement, and the demonstrators' objective has now increased to five demands, including electoral reform.
