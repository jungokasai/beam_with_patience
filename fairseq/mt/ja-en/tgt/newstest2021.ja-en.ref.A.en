The complete report (CanCam.jp) --Yahoo! News
A bottom heavy, medium-length hairstyle with layers that keeps it bouncy  [Minami style]
CanCam model, Honoka, goes for a hairstyle with bounce, like Tanaka Minami, whom she gushes is, "Not only beautiful, but very professional respectable!"
She went to Asahi Mitsuteru of the Hair Salon "SUN VALLEY" in Omotesando, who cuts Tanaka Minami's hair, to give her the "Minami-style " cut.
We will explain the process to get the "cut"!
Nogizaka46 Yamashita Mizuki, her first cover with her new, short look!
Let's check out Honoka's hair before cutting.
Thin, soft and volumenous hair.
Curly and unruly especially during the rainy season, she sometimes gets her hair straightened.
A heavy medium-length, with side bangs.
Let's start the cut!
First, we dampen the whole head, making it easier to cut.
Then section out the hair on the crown (just above the widest part of the head) and start cutting from the bottom.
Here are some key points to achieve a hairstyle just like Minami!
1. Double Bangs:  by cutting the inside layer of the bang a little shorter, you can either choose thicker full bangs by letting both layers fall or achieve lighter, see-through look when you separate the layers.
2. Making the most of your curls:  when those with curlier hair try to thin out volume, it may make it more difficult to tame.
Need to keep the balance of easy care, taming unruliness, and making the most of the curls while thinking about proportion.
3. Layering around the face and loose hair:  layered cut = a cutting at different lengths.
Layering around the face gives bounce and a cute finish.
By creating loose hair in 3 areas, around the temple and at the front and back of sideburns, you can create a stylish look when the hair is casually put up.
Release the sectioned out hair on the crown, cut together, then release around the face.
Pull out the upper part of the hair around the face and snip the ends of the hair.
This will create layers when the hair is let down, giving it bounce (this is a layered haircut).

Governor Yoshimura will "partner with Gurunavi" against COVID-19 (Sankei Sports) - Yahoo!News
The governor of Osaka Prefecture, Yoshimura Hirofumi (45) appeared remotely from the prefectural office on the Osaka ABC TV show, Cast (Mon-Fri, from 3:48), to announce that, as part of measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19, his office is considering teaming up with restaurant listings site Gurunavi.
Starting in the prefecture from the beginning of the month, "Infection Prevention Declaration" stickers are being issued to businesses that comply with guidelines, with the aim of promoting efforts to prevent the spread of infection, and provide peace of mind to citizens.
However, the number of stickers issued remains at a mere 11,000, whereas there are said to be 120,000 restaurants alone in the prefecture.
Governor Yoshimura explained, "We're planning on starting it at the end of the month, and we'd like to partner with a site like Gurunavi, so when you go to make a reservation it will show restaurants that have been issued with an Infection Prevention Declaration sticker, so you will know from the time you make the booking," elucidating the plan to work hand in hand with internet reservations sites.
"What's important is that we don't lump everything together and put the blame squarely with the 'nightlife district'. We need to clearly distinguish between the establishments that are taking adequate measures to prevent the spread of infection, and those that aren't. And therefore, it's important that we make efforts to increase the number of establishments that are doing their part," he added.

Starting from the 25th, the Toyosawacho Promotion Association (chairman: Nakamura Kenji) of Hanamaki city will be holding an exhibition called "The Toyosawacho History and Culture Exhibition" at the Kenji Hiroba, Kamicho.
On exhibition is a notebook showing that Miyazawa Kenji (1896-1933), a poet and writer of children's stories, made a donation to the areas affected by the Great Kanto Earthquake of 1923 (Taisho 12), along with other residents of Toyosawacho district, where he was raised.
It serves as an important document showing the connection between Kenji and Toyosawacho, and will be displayed together with other exhibits that introduce the culture and history of the town.
The exhibition will run until August 23rd.
The notebook was discovered by Ito Yuji (60), a member of the Promotion Association and an employee of the city's Toyosawacho Society, when he was organizing his storehouse last summer.
It was used by his grandfather-in-law, Takahashi Genzo (1900-1985), who ran a general store locally.
An entry dated September 15th reads, "Soliciting donations for the Tokyo City Earthquake (reserve troops)," along with X and O marks, and it also lists the names and amounts donated by Kenji and other residents of Toyosawacho at the time.
Four years after graduating high school, Lotte's Taneichi achieves his first shutout as a pro!
Great play from No. 4 Yasuda, and 2 points scored for good measure by Toritani (Baseball King) - Yahoo!News
Seibu 0 - 5 Lotte (10 innings, played at the MetLife Dome): Lotte's starting pitcher, Taneichi Atsuki, delivered 136 pitches during the nine innings, resulting in his delightful first shutout in the 4th year of his professional career.
It was the first shutout of the Pacific League this season, resulting in the team's third win and halting their losing streak at just two.
To begin with, Taneichi allowed Suzuki Shohei, who was first up to bat, to hit a double that broke through the third-base line, but following this, Genda Sosuke was immediately grounded out from third base and then Suzuki himself was also touched out when trying to advance to third base.
Helped out by the calm response of his fielders, Taneichi got through this initial slip-up with zero, and from the second inning onwards, he made short work of Seibu's batting lineup, using a combination of sliders and forkballs based around his accomplished straight.
This progress only served to improve his confidence, and the zeros lined up on the scoreboard.
Lotte's batting line had been unable to hit anything thrown by Seibu's starting pitcher, Honda Keisuke, until finally, at the top of the seventh inning, No. 3 Sugano Tsuyoshi walked on base with a four ball, and pinch runner Oka Hiromi succeeded in stealing second base.
Taking this chance, No. 4 Yasuda Hisanori sent a ball sailing perfectly over to the right of the field, and finally broke the deadlock.
Continuing on into the eighth inning, Toritani Takashi, who had been substituted in, was on the offensive against Seibu's No. 3 Miyagawa Tetsu, hitting a run-scoring hit between the left and centre fielders for two points, racking up four points for Lotte in no time.
This left everything resting on the shoulders of the Marines' young ace candidate, and the match was quickly decided.
Taneichi ended the eighth inning by getting all three batters out, and continued pitching in the ninth inning, by which point he had thrown over 100 balls.
Exerting himself, Taneichi allowed a succession of walks and found himself with two out and bases loaded, but in the end, a fast ball to Cory Spangenberg produced the 10th strikeout of the day, and the game was set.
Taneichi rejoiced with a smile on his face.
Waving bye-bye to accidents with a new initiative: Tsuruoka Police Station working with related organisations to promote safety awareness | Yamagata Newspaper
At the bicycle class held to kickstart the initiative, a collision between a bike and a car was simulated - Shoko Gakuen Driving School, Tsuruoka
Tsuruoka Police Station (chief of police: Sato Keizo) has begun a new "Bye-bye Accident Zero Initiative" in an effort to curb the relatively high number of accidents involving bicycles and motorbikes that occur in its jurisdiction.
The station will not only be promoting awareness of accident prevention together with local road safety organisations, but also aims to clampdown on bicycle traffic rule violations.
Three fatal traffic accidents happened this year within the jurisdiction, where the rider of a bicycle or motorbike was killed.
Although the overall number of accidents is on the decline, as of June 30th, the percentage of accidents involving bicycles is 11.7%, and 5.8% for motorbikes, both of which are higher than the average for the prefecture.
For bicycle accidents in particular, the rate has exceeded the prefectural average for the majority of the past five years, and so they planned the new initiative to try to overcome the situation.
The naming of the initiative is a play on the words "bike" and "bicycle" to eradicate accidents.
Related organisations will be asked to appeal to people more than ever in endeavours such as road safety classes, encouraging driving instruction for elderly people and the use of reflective clothing at night.
Police officers will issue people with a yellow card (disciplinary warning slip) as a caution when they violate a traffic rule.
A ceremony to signal the start of the initiative was held on the 21st at Shoku Gakuen Driving School in Tsuruoka.
Around 30 related officials were in attendance, to whom Chief Sato asked for their cooperation in "reducing even just one tragic accident" in his opening remarks.
Officials from the police department explained the details of the initiative and the activities of the various organisations.
And then a bicycle class was also held as one of the starting events.
A station official driving a car demonstrated how the impact exerted on a bicycle changes depending on whether the driver was applying the brakes at the time of the crash, or if they were travelling at 55km/h and not applying the brakes.
Kanauchi Koichi, chairman of the Tsuruoka Regional Road Safety Action Promotion Committee, said, "Today's demonstration served as a stark reminder of the horror of traffic accidents. I urge not only the elderly, but also young people, to take due care."

Akasakatei Comedy Club (Sobun, Akaiwa city), a publicly managed entertainment venue that had been closed due to the impact of COVID-19, held a regular entertainment event on the 25th after a 5-month hiatus.
Rakugo performer Kaminarimon Kisuke (75), who calls Akasakatei his home, and other performers based there drew laughs from the audience with their professional storytelling.
Kisuke performed Kinshu Banya, in which a sake seller tries to sneak in alcohol at the request of a vassal whose lord has prohibited alcohol, and a humorous exchange with the gatekeeper ensues.
There were a lot of laughs at his clear storytelling and how deliciously he mimed drinking alcohol.
A male company employee (58) from Naka ward, Okayama city, who attended with his wife, said with a smile, "His speaking style and timing were superb, and it pulled me in right away."
Kisuke said, "My voice wasn't the best because it was my first performance in so long, but it was a rewarding time."
There were also performances by a guest Rakugo performer, Katsura Chiroru (31) of Osaka city, and by the sleight of hand group, Tsuyama Magic Club.
Akasakatei Comedy Club began in 1996 in the former Akasaka-cho area as the first publicly managed entertainment venue in the country.
The venue has held monthly events and one-off shows since then, but had not held any events since February due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Bringing Joy with Bizen Ware Amabie Ornaments, Made by Students of the School of Special Needs Attached to Okayama University: Sanyo Shimbun Digital | San-Digi
High school students at the School of Special Needs Attached to Okayama University (Hirai, Naka ward, Okayama city) are making Bizen ware ornaments of Amabie, a spirit said to be able to quell epidemics, to give as gifts to elderly people in the community.
The endeavour was planned in the hopes of bringing the pandemic to an early end and praying for health in an environment where the impact of COVID-19 precludes the in-person sales experience in stores and the interaction with local residents that would normally take place.
Starting in June, 11 high school seniors made the figures three days a week as part of their morning classes.
After putting effort into rolling out the clay and shaping it with cutters, they worked to wrap them in straw to bring out the distinctive "hidasuki" scarlet color of Bizen ware.
The students said that it took about two or three weeks to complete, including the process of drying and firing.
"We worked really hard to make these and we filled them with our hope that the elderly will not give up hope in the face of COVID-19 and will continue to stay healthy and happy," explained a third-year student (18).
On the 27th, the students plan to deliver 40 of the Bizen ware figurines to the residents of Okayama Yurakuen (part of the same facility), a nursing home where they hold choral events and other interactions.
The students say they will continue making the Bizen ware Amabie figurines until the end of July, and then they will decide where to send the remaining ones.
On August 1st, the Senmaya District Urban Development Council (chairman: Murakami Keiichi) of Ichinoseki city will hold a special exhibition event in the parking lot of the Senmaya Municipal Community Center in the Senmaya part of the city: the first ever Umbrella Sky Senmaya, where the sky will be decorated with umbrellas.
While summer festivals and other events are being cancelled due to the impact of the COVID-19 virus, this event was planned to bring joy to the people of the area, with about 100 colorful umbrellas painting the summer sky of Senmaya.
On the day, the event will display decorations of colorful umbrellas donated by local residents, and some of the arranged umbrellas will feature illustrations done by local children on the clear plastic canopies.
Food trucks will be set up, and a professional photographer for yukata photo sessions in will also be in attendance.
The event will take place from 10am to 4pm.
The yukata photo sessions will take place on the 1st from 10am until midday.
Those interested should apply to Sugawara Toshikazu (090-8859-5928), chairman of the Senmaya Kaido Kimono City Walks Executive Committee.
Akashi Shogyou HS • Nakamori gets his third no hitter! 7Ks!
Tigers and Giants both highly praise Hanshin • Wada TA is "a sure top class player" (Sankei Sports) --Yahoo! News
The exclusive Hyogo high school baseball tournament was held on the 24th, with the first game being Akashi Shougyo HS (top four in the last spring/summer Koshien tournament), a strong team playing against Takasago (2nd round, Takasago Municipal Baseball Stadium) and wins a called game in the 5th inning, 11-0.
151 km right-handed pitcher, Nakamori Shunsuke (senior), who is a top draft pick, showed off with a no-hitter, seven strikeouts and excellent pitching in the 3rd inning.
Wada Yutaka (57), technical advisor for Hanshin baseball team's headquarters, highly praised him.
The start was delayed by 39 minutes due to the continuous rain and field maintenance.
A muddy mound.
Even so, the long-awaited first official game of the year caused enthusiasm.
In the end, he gave up one walk, but pitched an impressive no-hitter.
He had 7 strikeouts and with a no hit and no run in the 3rd inning, contributed to a called game in the 5th inning.
"It was floating all over. It was good to strikeout with fastballs, but the easily recognized low curve balls needs to be adjusted." Nakamori critiqued himself harshly, even when he marked the fastest pitch that day at 148 km, impressing the professional eyes of Hanshin, Giants, and Orix who were behind the net.
It was Hanshin • Wada TA's first onsite observation since the first round of Koshien last summer (2nd round ○ 4-3 Hanasaki Tokuharu HS).
He praised that "he is still growing. He is a top class high schooler, after all. Even with bad footing, his form didn't collapse and he controlled well. He will most likely be a top candidate recruit."
Giant • Kishi Scout also said, "He was one of the best I've seen recently.
He's managed to improve himself in the middle of this Covid crisis.", showering with praise.
While he was "still undecided between going pro or to go to college, a 50/50 chance" at the end of June, he will make up his mind after the August 16th Koshien exchange game (vs Kiryu No1 HS), saying he "would love to turn pro but it's still hard to make decisions."
But before that, the goal is to win this tournament and be in the top eight.
There is a rule that allows you to change the lineup of 20 players on the bench every game.
This game was also played by all 16 Seniors.
For all 39 seniors to play in the games, they must continue to win the remaining three games.
"This is the last tournament and we've been practicing hard for three years. We hope all seniors participate. We want to win all the games including Koshien. For me personally, my goal is to have a shutout game, as coach (Hazama) keeps reminding me I haven't yet." The team and his goals seem to have been set for their last summer.

Butler once again praises Tyler Herro, the young star carrying the future of the Heat, "He doesn't think like a rookie" (Basket Count) - Yahoo!News
The Heat's first scrimmage (practice) game is against the Kings (photo credit: Getty Images).
At 104-98, the Heat secured an easy victory in this game, with backcourt heroes in their elements as Duncan Robinson scored 18 points, the most out of the team, and Tyler Herro followed with 15.
In addition to Robinson, who is one of the best shooters in the league, the stepping up of Herro, a rookie who was nominated 13th overall in the draft, will likely become a key element for the Heat.
Herro missed 15 games in February and March due to an ankle injury, and the season began a long hiatus after his first game back against the Hornets on March 12th.
Herro said, "I was able to get my condition back up to 100% as there was plenty of time available. I feel the best I've ever felt," but actions speak louder than words, and his performance during the scrimmage was ample evidence of this.
Herro has been afforded more play time due to the delay in starting point guard Kendrick Nunn joining back with the team, a chance that he did not let go to waste.
It certainly paid off, since he played splendidly in a different role from normal, and was able to score 15 points.
Team captain Jimmy Butler once again praised his "favourite", Herro.
"Herro's a great handler, he's able to score points, he can defend. He's able to do anything to support the team. He doesn't think like a rookie, which is why he's comfortable in any position. He studies video footage, and thinks about how his teammates move and get in a free position, and what he should do in response."
Even before this season started, Butler was impressed with Herro's strong, un-rookie-like competitive spirit and stoic attitude towards basketball.
That's why he invited Herro to individual training sessions starting at 4am, and they trained together.
Butler has said of Herro in the past, "He makes his opinion known to anyone, and never backs down. I respect that kind of fighting spirit."
Butler is also a player who speaks his mind and, if he thinks it will help the team, is known to air harsh opinions, even while knowing it will cause a conflict.
In the past, this has caused a rift between him and his teammates.
Butler may see some of his younger self in Herro.
Though his fearsome countenance sometimes gets the better of other players, those with the fortitude to follow Butler receive excellent guidance.
If this quality of mutual respect between pupil and teacher spreads through the ranks, then there will be no limit to what the Heat can do as a team.
Shimada Commercial Asserts Dominance from the Get-go in the 4th Game of the Summer 2020 Shizuoka Prefecture High School Baseball Tournament, Shimada Commercial vs Hamamatsu Johoku Tech | Shizuoka Shimbun At-S
Shimada Commercial vs Hamamatsu Johoku Tech: Great head start from Matsuura at the bottom of the 1st inning with the bases loaded and no outs for Shimada Commercial, Kusanagi Baseball Stadium
Game 4 (first game at Kusanagi): Hamamatsu Johoku Tech: 0000000–0, Shimada Commercial: 0410000X– 5; Game time: 1hr 26min
Summary: Shimada Commercial got a good chance early on and defeated Hamamatsu Johoku Tech in a shutout.
Shimada Commercial had the bases loaded with no outs in the 1st innings when Matsuura put them in the lead with a well-timed two-run hit.
They added two more points with an infield grounder and a squeeze play.
As for pitching, starting pitcher Saito displayed some good pitching, with only one ball hit in the sixth inning, he did not concede any points.
In the final inning, Hamamatsu Johoku Tech failed to take advantage of a good opportunity, with two outs and the bases loaded.
■ Fourth game led by a third year student
Gratitude for the lead taken by second-year Matsuura.
It was the second-year No. 4 player, making his first appearance this summer, who took the wind out of Johoku Tech's sails.
With no outs and the bases loaded in the 1st inning, Shimada Commercial's Matsuura hit a curveball and sent it to the front left.
"If we lost, it would be immediate retirement for the third years. I wanted to it to my hit that would bring us the win."
The talented Matsuura, who also wore the No. 4 uniform last fall, swelled with pride.
The first three innings were played mostly by the third years, with the powerful second years waiting their turn.
Coach Ikeda gathered the players in a meeting and told the nine, "The last three years have bound us together. We'll go forward with our best members."
On that day, they solidified their core, with four second years among the nine starting members.
It may seem callous, but it proves they were playing the game in earnest.
Matsuura said reassuringly, "From now on, the level of the opposing pitchers is going to rise too. I'll face them with the intent of sending the runners home."
Saito, who pitched in consecutive innings, showed the will of the third years, keeping the hits to one in the sixth inning and not letting anyone set foot on second base.
The player with No. 10 on his back cited the favorable catching as a synergistic effect, saying, "The second years going in also motivated the third years. I hope it leads to victory."
With the team aiming to break into the final four for the third consecutive year, including the Shizuoka tournament up through last year, the remaining games will not be just for making memories.

With the live music venues that provide a platform for music activities forced to close due to the impact of COVID-19, many musicians are without a place to sing or perform.
It was planned by singer-songwriter nappo (46), a resident of Minami Soma city, and DAZU-O (37) of the Iwaki city music group Mehikari Boyz, hoping that people will believe in the power of music, especially at a time when we don't know what lies ahead.
nappo handled the lyrics and songwriting and DAZU-O provided the rapping.
Planning began in March during the pandemic and the circle expanded in the blink of an eye, with successive endorsements by singer-songwriter MANAMI (28) from Fukushima city, Jun Kanno (38), and others.
Looking overwhelmed with emotion, nappo says, "It turned into an incredible lineup that would be unimaginable in normal times. I want to enjoy this opportunity to the fullest."
To prevent the risk of infection, they did not set up an opportunity for the 16 to get together, instead recording their parts from separate live music venues and their homes.
To further support the plan, an image character was comissioned from Koa-san, a painter from Iwaki city.
It is modeled on Fukushima prefecture and expresses the topography of its rich nature in blue and green.
The musicians aim to broadcast the final version on YouTube, and release it on CD.
Next year will mark 10 years since the disaster in Fukushima, and it is also when thepostponed Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics are planned to be held.
DAZU-O said, "There is a large burden on those of us who have overcome difficulties. I'll be happy if we can present this song on the milestone and encourage many people."
The other participating musicians are as follows.

Instant Detection of Crisis Occurrence From Internet Information, Also Identifies Misinformation (JBpress) - Yahoo! News
"I want to know what disasters and incidents are occurring where as soon as possible!"
This strong need is held not only by newspapers, television, and other news organizations, but also by social infrastructure companies and local governments.
A service to address this need is "Sepctee," developed by Spectee, which handles information analysis using AI.
(Photo) A specialized team determines the authenticity of social media information after alerts from Spectee.
At present, the means through which people get information about the disasters and accidents happening is starting to shift from television to internet information (social media).
Social media such as Twitter has become crucial for transmitting information directly after the onset of an accident or disaster.
However, it is difficult to constantly monitor and manually extract what is useful from the overflowing information.
Spectee has the faculty to detect information related to natural disasters and accidents from the information circulating on social media such as Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook, and after analyzing the content and upon determining the truth or falsehood of the information, will transmit it to corporations.
"We asses a wide range of events that have the negative impact of stopping or delaying society's activities as 'crises'," (Murakami Kenjiro, Representative Director CEO), it is a crisis management support service that visualizes various crises occurring domestically and overseas.
NHK, at the time of the Kumamoto earthquake that occurred in April, 2016, was the first major case to utilize Spectee, and after that the move to implement it among companies has spread rapidly.
It is stated that over 350 companies are using Spectee, including not only news outlets such as television stations and newspapers, but also companies that support social infrastructure such as electric, gas and transportation, as well as local governments across the country.
Analyzing posts and determining the type and location of "crises"
Spectee distributes information by taking four steps: "information gathering," "analysis and content classification," "setting titles," and "judging authenticity."
User companies specify in advance the region (prefecture, administrative district, or city, town, village etc.) and crisis category (natural disaster, accidents, etc.) for information collection.
Spectee uses the API provided by social media to gather posts that apply to these specifications.
Then, it analyzes and categorizes the text, images, and videos contained in those posts.
For example, if a video is posted that shows a fire engine, black smoke rising from a building, and orange flames coming out from the roof, it will be classified under "fire."
In addition, it will classify an image of an overturned vehicle under "traffic accident," or streets submerged in water as "road flooding."
Spectee also makes an estimate of the location where the disaster or accident has occurred.
"There are many cases in which the location is unknown based on a post, so the estimate is made by combining a variety of information" said CEO Murakami.
For example, if a road sign or sign board appears in an image or video, information about location names will be extracted from there and compared against a database of locations to determine where it is.
Angels lose the opening game ... Otani, one for five, strikes out in the 9th inning, on three pitches with the bases loaded (Baseball King) --Yahoo! News
○ Athletics 7x - 3 Angels ● <Oakland Coliseum, July 24, local time> Ohtani Shohei (26) of the Angels was No.3 in the opening game against Athletics held on enemy territory on the 24th (25th, Japan time), participating in the starting lineup as a designated hitter.

"Zurukomi" and "Uchinchi" what do they mean ... ...?
We ask Chiba residents, "Words I thought weren't really dialects"  (Netorabo) --Yahoo! News
I am a citizen of Chiba prefecture near Tokyo.
I have lived in this prefecture for about 30 years since I was born.
When I said "Zurukomi", which means "cutting in", in a conversation with a friend from college (Tokyo), it was met with a blank stare.
The word was understood in the context of the sentence and sound, but the people of Tokyo and Saitama told me they "don't say that".
― ― Does it mean, “Zurukomi → Be sneaky(zuru) and cut in?”
It seems to make sense, so the meaning can be guessed somehow.
One more thing.
It wasn't like this was pointed out to me, but the expression "Uchinchi", which means "my house," is never seen in books or whatnot, and since my friends have never heard of it, I looked it up after I became an adult and found out it was a dialect.
― ― Really?! “Uchinchi” ... ... I never knew?
I use it in my hometown (Gunma prefecture), but I didn't realize because I stopped using it naturally after I became an adult.
Japan's "hiyashi chuka" not a hit with Chinese people...?
The reason behind "chilled noodle dishes'" unpopularity - Yahoo!News
In China, hiyashi chuka is called "Japanese cold noodles."
As previously stated, hiyashi chuka, invented based off of China's "liang ban mian (chilled stirred noodles)," is a Chinese dish of Japanese origin (Japanese-style Chinese Cuisine).
Therefore, although it never really exists in China, with food diversification, it has come to be seen there in the summer at Japanese restaurants.
Also, adapted products with names such as "Japanese Style Soba Liang Mian/Soba Hiyashi Chuka" and "Sichuan Chicken Liang Mian/Sichuan-style Chicken Hiyashi Chuka" are recently popping up at Japanese-run convenience stores.
However, in China the popularity of this Japanese-style Chinese dishes is generally not high, pushed out by trendy Chinese cuisines that pack a punch, such as Sichuan cuisine and Hunan cuisine.
Naturally, the flavors of Japanese-style Chinese cuisine is often familiar to Chinese people as well.
For that reason, though not as terrible, it does tend to be criticized as lacking in impressiveness.
"Hiyashi chuka" is not an exception to this, and remains a modest presence.
Incidentally, the name for hiyashi chuka in China is "Japanese-style chilled noodles."
For Chinese people, it is perceived as a Japanese dish.
The summer staple is "Liangpi".
In China, when it comes to a summery noodle dish, it is "liangpi."
Though in Japan many people may not be familiar with it, liangpi is a flat noodle made from wheat, rice, or starch that originated in the Shanxi province.
In fact, it is said to have a more than 2000 years of history.
It is a staple of the gourmet street food fare sold at food stalls, and at a price of 10~20 yuan (150~300 yen) it is extremely reasonable.
It does include the character "chilled," but liangpi is not shocked with ice like Japan's hiyashi chuka.
Rather, room temperature is the standard.
Preferred toppings such as matchstick cucumbers and carrots or boiled bean sprouts are placed on top of the noodles, and condiments like cilantro, chili pepper, vinegar and garlic are added on.
A special seasoning mix of soy sauce, chili oil, vinegar, tahini and peanut paste is topped as a finishing touch.
Together with the smooth noodles, the tartness is refreshing and intertwines with the richness of the spicy sauce while going down smoothly even when appetites are low in the heat of summer.
In addition, because it has permeated all of China, it is known for its range of varieties with many different types toppings and seasonings, and is enjoyed as such.

The benefits that cold showers have for your body and mind (Cosmopolitan) - Yahoo!News
Suppressing inflammation such as muscle pain
A study published in The North American Journal of Medical Sciences that examined the effectiveness of hydrotherapy (a type of treatment that uses water) found that it seems to have a promising effect on physical and mental recovery.
It seems that by showering with cold water after exercising, muscle pain and other inflammatory symptoms can be reduced.
According to Professor Douglas Casa, CEO of the Korey Stringer Institute sports medicine research facility, who holds a teaching position at the University of Connecticut, "After exercising, it's important to take a cold shower as soon as possible. By lowering the body temperature soon after you finish physical exertion, your recovery from both the fatigue and the inflammation caused by exercise will be quicker."
Reduce fatigue
If you exercise when it's hot, your heart, muscles and skin need more blood pumping around them than normal.
Professor Casa explains, "When you exercise, your heart rate increases, which in turn increases the blood flow to the heart, and you require energy to contract your muscles, so the blood flow to your muscles increases. When it comes to your skin, you have a lot of blood flowing to your skin so that you can regulate your body temperature."
"A cold shower will reduce your skin temperature, thereby reducing the flow of blood to the skin. Instead, blood is routed to internal organs such as your stomach and intestines, which makes it easier to absorb fluids and nutrients after exercise. As a result, you feel less fatigued after exercise."
Can induce the effect of hormesis
Professor Droszewski also explains how a cold shower can induce the effect of hormesis.
The idea of hormesis is that it is better for your body to undergo small amounts of stress and harmful substances rather than none at all.
"Exercising in low oxygen conditions, intermittent fasting and cold showers are all common examples of hormesis that can promote good health. Taking a cold shower stimulates your hormones and neurotransmitters, which can lead to stronger physical tenacity and resilience."

Hanshin • Oyama, 7th home run two games in a row!
Manager Yano "Looking  dignified" (Sankei Sports) --Yahoo! News
(Central League, Nagoya D on the 24th, Chunichi 2-5 Hanshin, seventh game, Hanshin 4 wins, 3 losses) The momentum of No. 4 continues.
The ball soared and landed in the middle rows of the left field seats.
Oyama hits a homer for two consecutive games and goes around the diamond.
When he returned to the bench, he showed his pearly whites.
"While I've been making good swings, I focused on this one ball and took the full swing."
He entered his turn at bat in the 4th inning, 0-2.
Swinging aggressively from the beginning, he fouled off the first pitch, then came pitch number 2.
He didn't miss the so-so 134 km slider from Ohno Yudai.
A perfect hit, the moment the ball hit the sweet spot of the bat, it was surely in the stands.
Following the previous day's game against Hiroshima (Koshien) on the 23rd, the hits in two consecutive games were the sign of a comeback.
It was also a valuable hit off a pitcher that is his nemesis.
When he played against Ohno Yudai at Koshien on the 17th, he tallied nine hits and four runs.
However, as for games at Nagoya Dome, he has allowed seven wins, one loss and one no-decision in the past 12 games, and suffered from seven consecutive losses since August 23, 2013 with a tie in between.
He got the hit for the first time in 23 innings with a spectacular swing off such a difficult opponent at Nagoya Dome (despite the pitcher being replaced mid-inning, it still counts as an inning pitched) and did not allow the opponent a chance.
Manager Yano commented, "He is highly skilled to be able to take firm advantage of a weak pitch. Even when timing is off and results in a foul ball, he hits with great form. I think he will continue to hit.", expecting continued success.
He hit into right-field in the first inning, marking six consecutive hits and three consecutive games with multiple hits.
At the start of the season, he started as a second stringer, but with seven home runs and 16 RBIs, he is now working perfectly as the team leader and No.4 batter.
He will continue to show results, helping contribute to the team's victories.

Macau Casino Supervisory Authority inspects the implementation status of epidemic prevention measures at casino facilities ... New coronavirus negative certificate must be presented during admission (Macau Newspaper) --Yahoo! News
Approximately 40 casino facilities in Macau were closed for 15 days from February 5th to 19th under the new coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19), but since businesses resumed on the 20th of the same month, strict epidemic prevention measures have been taken.
The Macau Casino Regulatory Authority (DICJ) is asking operating casinos to take the utmost precautions for the health of its employees and guests when it reopens, ensuring distances between gaming (casino) tables and distances with seating at table games (for example, only 3 to 4 people can be seated at one table at the same time at a baccarat table), as well as stipulating that every other or every third slot machine be operated, in order to reduce risk of cross infection.
Disinfection of gaming equipment such as chips has also been reinforced.
In addition, guests are required to wear masks, have body temperature taken, and provide a valid health code (by entering recent travel history, contact history with covid-19 patients, presence of symptoms such as fever and coughs, and contact information) at the time of admission.
Starting midnight of July 15th, the presentation of a negative PCR test result for COVID-19 (issued within the validity period by a licensed facility from Macau or Guangdong Province) was also added to the condition.
The new requirement to present a negative certificate is due to the relaxation of the border measures between Macau and Guangdong Province from 15th, at 6am (eliminating the 14-day quarantine requirement, with conditions), and will be a precautionary measure.
In response to changes in admission conditions from July 15th, DICJ has on July 18th, had Adriano Ho, director of the bureau, and others inspected the implementation status of epidemic prevention measures at casino facilities, as well as calling a meeting with the security representatives from six casino operating companies reiterating the health protection of employees and guests by thoroughly controlling guest admission.
DICJ will continue to carry out rigorous patrols of casino facilities, and will have regular meetings with the operating companies according to the situation and evaluation, as well as adjusting appropriate epidemic prevention measures at the casino in accordance with the guidelines of the Government Health Agency.
This visit to the casino facility was accompanied by Lam Chong, Chief of Center for Health Protection, and was provided with guidance on disinfecting gaming (casino) chips and safe distancing between the seats of electronic casino equipment.
Because of the sharp decline in inbound tourists due to epidemic prevention measures including entry restrictions, the cumulative casino sales for the period from January to June of this year was down 77.4% from the same period of the previous year to 33.72 billion Macau Pataca (Japanese yen equivalent: about 451.9 billion yen).
Cheer of Light from Yuwaku Onsen: Next Month, a Message to Medical Workers in Place of Bonbori Festival (Kitaguni Shinbunsha) - Yahoo! News
In Yuwaku Onsen, where the annual "Yuwaku Bonbori Festival" has been canceled due to the novel coronavirus, efforts will begin on August 1 to light up paper lanterns inscribed with messages of encouragement for medical workers.
Papers inscribed by local residents and fans from all over the country will be attached to roughly 350 lanterns and a cheer of light will envelope Yuwaku, sending solace to visitors.
Organized by the the Yuwaku Tourism Bureau, Bonbori Festival is a reenactment of the festival that appears in the anime "Hanasaku Iroha," which was modeled after Yuwaku.
It began in 2011 when the anime was broadcast, and is attended every year by throngs of anime fans from all over the country.
Every year, from the lighting ceremony in July to the main festival in October, lanterns are hung and lit every day on the stairs beside the public bath that lead to Yuwaku Inari Shrine.
This year novel coronavirus forced the cancelation of the festival, but the bureau proposed the current plan after continuing cries from local and national fans that "a summer in Yuwaku with no Bonbori is sad."
It was given the name "Recovery Campaign," in hopes of being even the slightest bit useful in healing and recovery as the world faces the adverse circumstances of the corona disaster.
Currently they have received illustrated messages written by each student, around 50 of them, from the local Yuwaku Elementary and Shibahara Middle Schools, and over 100 entries from around the country.
A message sheet can be purchased from the bureau's website, and if it is placed in the return envelope after inscription and sent to the bureau, one can receive a photo of it attached to a lit bonbori lantern.
One set is priced at 6000 yen, and applications will be accepted until reaching roughly 350 lanterns.
The lighting of the bonbori lanterns is planned to last through the end of November.
"Reading these messages brings courage to us too. Since next year is a turning point as the 10th time, we want to hold the festival magnificently" said Yamashita Shinichiro (48), who has worked as the head of the executive committee since the festival's launch.
A commissioned illustration of Asanokawa Ohashi Bridge and characters from Hanasaku Iroha was also prepared for the campaign.
Starting on the 1st, an illustrated clear file folder will be given to guests using special accommodation plans at traditional inns at Yuwaku Onsen.
The Core Four Holding up Seibu "Mori Yama Tono Gen" Join Forces of Spirit (Tokyo Sports Web) - Yahoo! News
Seibu's pride, "Mori Yama Tono Gen" showed cooperation of spirits as they performed their second walk-off win of this season.
At 2-2 in the 9th inning of the match against Lotte (MetLife) on the 24th, the four, who were in a slump still far from their best condition, showed their tenacity for victory.
First up, Genda, on a drag bunt, made a head-first slide to first base.
At that, third up, Mori, who for the last 6 matches has been at the very bottom hitting .182, decided on a sacrifice bunt for one out and second base.
Fourth up, Yamakawa, was given an intentional walk and Tonozaki, who from the day had switched with Mori and returned to fifth, smashed a fastball from Masuda, leading to a 3-2 victory.
"Even I was surprised by (Genda's drag bunt) there on the bench, and I thought I just had to do something. Tomoya also conveyed through his bunt that he believed in me and that he was connecting it to me there after him. Before Yamakawa went to first with the walk he said, "Be aggressive!" and with that I fully got into the mood and was able to do it," the hero, Tonozaki said, wrapping up the hopes of the three who had set the course for the walk-off win.
Mori and Yamakawa, the first and second draft of 2013, Tonozaki, 3rd draft of 2014, and Genda, 3rd draft of 2016, are the "Core 4," the 4 players that team officials have dubbed "the current core of the team."
All have experience as captains from their amateur days, and their sense of responsibility is also greater than others.
Tonosaki, who replaced Yamakawa as captain in his fourth year at Fuji University, said, "Yamakawa-san is such a skilled speaker and was a captain who motivated the team with his words. Conversely, I'm clumsy with words so I was the one to stand watching over from behind and left the talking to my articulate vice captain," and this shows that each make use of their individual traits while supporting the new captain, Genda, and the new head of the Player's Association, Mori.
"Genda's drag bunt? That wasn't a sign. But at that I thought "Okay, we can do this." Tomoya's was also a fantastic bunt. Tonosaki also hit well," Coach Tsuji said in praise of the joint forces of spirits of "Mori Yama Tono Gen."
All four are currently struggling with hitting averages of .24~.25, but they support the team with their wisdom and their ways to win even if they can't hit.

Statue of Omura Masujiro in Suzenji Conveys His Contributions as an Educator (Yamaguchi) | Ube Nippo, Kono Machi Media Web
On the 23rd, a bronze statue of Omura Masujiro (1825-1869), considered one of the top ten figures of the Restoration, has been unveiled in his birthplace of Suzenji, Yamaguchi city.
There was an unveiling ceremony in the front gardens of the Suzenji Regional Civic Center, where it has been erected, and locals and related parties celebrated its completion.
Masujiro was a tactician, an occidental scholar, and a doctor at the end of the Tokugawa Shogunate and beginning of the Meiji Restoration.
After taking up a teaching position the Institute for the Study of Western Books, the Shogunate's occidental studies research and education institute, he opened a private school, Kyukyodo, in Edo, where he taught western studies, military tactics, and medicine.
Even after returning to the Choshu Domain, he gave lectures on military tactics at the Yamaguchi Meirinkan school.
The bronze statue focuses on Masujiro as an educator.
He is depicted standing next to a globe with a book in hand, lecturing on western studies.
The height of the statue including the pedestal is about 3 meters (statue: 1.55 meters), and it was said to be made from the perspective of Masujiro's pupils, receiving his lectures.
Local designer Takahama Marie (27), a descendant of Masujiro's wife, Kotoko, was in charge of the design.
It was built with donations solicited by the Executive Committee for the 150th Anniversary of Omura Masujiro's Death (chairman Okamoto Satoshi), whose parent organization is the Suzenji Neighborhood Council.
They collected 12.8 million yen of donations from 1,104 people around the country.
The project cost, including installing donor name plates, was approximately 12 million yen.
The surplus donations will be used for the upkeep and management of the bronze statue.
Chairman Okamoto stated, "Masujiro, who kept his aspirations high and made enormous contributions as an educator, is the pride of our hometown. The bronze statue represents the hopes of the local children who will carry our future."
Mbappé Substituted with Injury After Sustaining Nasty Tackle, Leaves Pitch on Crutches  (SPORT.es) | Yahoo! News
On the 24th local time, Paris Saint-Germain defeated Saint-Étienne 1-0 in the French Cup Final at the Stade de France, scoring their 13th victory for the first time in two years.
PSG achieved second national title, defeating Saint-Étienne with Neymar's winning goal.
Neymar's goal in the first half clinched the victory, allowing PSG to take away their second national title after Ligue 1, although their current situation means that they should be worried about the upcoming Champion's League in August.
Kylian Mbappé, who was in the starting eleven, was substituted with an injury after sustaining a nasty standing tackle from opposing centerback Loïc Perrin.
Thirty minutes into the first half, the young French star was knocked down with his right ankle in a pinched position, grimacing in pain.
This play spurred players from both teams to erupt into a brawl in an explosive situation.
Seeming to have twisted his right ankle, Mbappé was unable to continue playing.
Perrin was given a red card.
After the match, Mbappé left the stadium on crutches, with his right foot fixed in position.
PSG will face Lyon in the Coupe de la Ligue finals on August 1 at 4:10 JST, but it will surely be impossible to use Mbappé in this match.
It will be necessary to wait for the medical report issued by the club, but it is also likely that he will be absent from the Championship League, to be held in Portugal.
Bringing Art Closer During the COVID-19 Pandemic, Online Art Museum (HASARD) Launched by Konno (Hachinohe Native) (The Daily Tohoku Shimbun) - Yahoo! News
There exists an art museum where anyone can encounter art for free any time they like.
Its lineup is wide-ranging, from notable painters like Claude Monet and Gustav Klimt, to unknown domestic artists.
Since the online art museum HASARD "opened its doors" in April 2019, its user-friendliness and novelty have won users' hearts, and now the new lifestyle of the pandemic has been an opportunity for it to garner even more attention.
Museum director Shinnosuke Konno (26) from Hachinohe, now resident in Tokyo, who launched the site, says, "I wanted to create a service that would allow anyone to enjoy art easily. I want people to come into contact with art, especially under such dire circumstances."
What surprises visitors to HASARD is the sheer abundance of exhibitions and the beauty of the images.
As of the 24th, there are a total of 14 exhibitions publicly available, including permanent exhibitions and special exhibitions, and the viewers are fascinated by the works in ultra-high-resolution that shows not just the coloring, but even the texture of the brush strokes.
With no member registration and no admittance fees required, it is distinctive because it is free not only for viewers but also for artists who want to hold individual exhibitions.
Also attracting attention is the way artworks are displayed, something which could only be achieved online.
One example of this is how the paintings are made to move.
"It Begins to Move Again," a permanent exhibition on Claude Monet, employs digital processing to make the clouds, flowers, and fields of grass move.
Stemming from the desire (of Director Konno) of "wanting to make it absorbing even for people with little interest in art," it can make you feel like you are inside the painting.
Director Konno was an elementary school student when he first discovered art.
When he and his family visited the Aomori Museum of Art, which had just been completed at the time, he saw the three giant paintings of Marc Chagall's Aleko and was shocked by their impressive impact.
From the very next day, his time in art class became fun, and even after he took admission to university as an opportunity to come to Tokyo, he developed a habit of visiting galleries.
At the same time, he felt that there were many people who have little opportunity to encounter art for a variety of reasons, like not having art museums nearby, or big exhibitions only being held in metropolitan areas, or being unable to go out because they're caring for children.
For that reason, while working at an IT-related company, he spent about two months launching a website where you can appreciate art online.
User numbers reached an average of 10,000 per month in the first 10 months after startup, and rose to about 30,000 after COVID-19 infections spread.
If anybody could enjoy art however they want, whenever they want to see it...
HASARD's aim resonated with even more people than expected because of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Director Konno emphasized that the significance of art appreciation is how it can enrich the imagination.
"If your imagination becomes enriched, you gain the ability to reach out to people who are suffering.
I want society to become better by bringer art closer to people," he says, expressing his thoughts.
The simple reason the Age of Japanese Quality will come as the Age of Chinese Quality ends (Modern business) - Yahoo!News
With the pandemic, a change in values
A lot of predictions and debates are happening regarding the world after the pandemic.
In the realm of business, there is a possibility that the changes mentioned in the July 8 article, "In Japan "management" jobs are now starting to disappear...! The cruel truth" and the July 4 article "The reason "Japanese manufacturing" is looking like it will make a big come back in the "Post-covid" World" could occur.
(Photograph) The true form of "Japan's Strength" that only Japanese people do not know.... An unexpected reality in Asia
In addition, in the emotional arena it is thought that trends such as those in the June 26 article ""How to fully burnout" to send to those who have become aware of the end of life with corona," and the June 10 article, "With corona and riots rising, now is the time to reevaluate the effect of "only calling on the gods in times of hardship"" will become mainstream.
And what we can expect will become clearly visible to us with the combination of these two, "material (economy/business)" and "emotion," is a large shift "from Chinese quality to Japanese quality."
For example, if a T-shirt or a digital camera is inferior or defective, it is frustrating, but it does not put the consumer's life at stake.
In comparison, what has been a topic of attention recently is the unreliable quality of Chinese-made masks and ventilators... for products such as these, that are linked directly to life and safety, "Chinese quality" is deadly.
No matter how cheap they are no one can buy such products.
People will seek "Japanese quality" products even if it means paying a considerable price.
Of course this trend is not only arising in Japan.
The Western countries have fallen into a dire situation due to shortages of masks and medical equipment, yet even so it has become clear that they have had to return products time and time again due to inexcusably poor "Chinese quality."
Safety and Security over Price
Moreover, products such as automobiles are also products in which a defect can be fatal (deaths caused by vehicular accidents).
No matter how aggressive countries such as China, Korea and others are on this "you get what you pay for" bargain sale strategy, ultimately, they cannot stand up against Japan-made products, and the reason a situation like the one described in the June 6 article "Will it be a sole victory after all, and the world's car manufacturers bow down to Toyota?", will arise is because "Japanese quality" is strongly sought after for automobiles.
And this pandemic has given rise to thoughts about the necessity of "safety and security" in many other products as well.
Furthermore, safety and security are not only important in the "Japanese quality of manufacturing" but also the "Japanese quality of logistics and other services."
Such as the case with the toilet paper craze, even if there is sufficient production capacity, there are cases in which there are hold-ups at intermediate distribution stages and the product is not delivered.
Furthermore, as with the April 17 article "Who is the culprit behind the mask shortage! We will not tolerate the crisis opportunism of the Chinese Communist Party", it makes us keenly aware that Japan's domestic self-sufficiency is also an important component for "safety and security."
In an emergency it is natural for any country to prioritize their own nation, and it is very important to make the procurement of necessities such as masks (medical equipment) and food possible domestically.
More than 100 newly infected coronavirus cases in South Korea for the first time in 115 days = record number of 86 people from overseas in flux (Yonhap News) --Yahoo! News
[Seoul Yonhap News] South Korea's Central Epidemic Prevention Task Force Headquarters announced on the 25th, as of midnight that day, the number of people infected with the new Covid-19 virus had increased by 113 from midnight the day before to a total of 14,092.
It is the first time in 115 days since April 1st (101 people) that the number of newly infected people per day exceeded 100.
This appears to be in addition to the 32 crew members on the Russian ship that entered Busan Port who were found to be infected, 32 workers out of the 293 workers who returned from Iraq on the 24th tested positive.
The number of new infections in South Korea was in the 30-60 range except on the 20th (26 people).
Of the new infections announced on the 25th, 86 people came from overseas, the highest number since January 20, when the first infected person was reported in South Korea.
Largest number of people coming in was from Iraq at 36, followed by Russia at 34, Philippines at 5 and USA at 3.
Meanwhile, there were 27 confirmed cases of local infections throughout the city, 11 each in Seoul and Gyeonggi-do, and 5 in Busan.
Five people in Busan were employees of a repair shop who went on board the Russian ship.
The death toll remains unchanged from the previous day, at a total of 298.
J1 Soccer: Nagoya Player Miyahara Tests Positive for COVID-19, the First Case After Resuming League Play | Shizuoka Shimbun At-S
On the 25th, J1 League team Nagoya announced that it was confirmed that defender Miyahara Kazuya (24) has tested positive for COVID-19.
This is the first positive test result in a player since the J-League resumed.
He is the third such player in this club, following both forwarder Kanazaki Mu (31), who was infected in June, and Austrian goalkeeper Mitchell Langerak (31).
The two have already received treatment and resumed playing.
This season, Miyahara was on the bench in the J1 match against Oita, which was played in the Showa Denko Dome Oita on the 22nd.
Nagoya clarified in an online press conference on the 25th that it had administered PCR tests on 60 people, including players and staff, on the same day.
98% reflective.
The white paint originally from Teflon-treated frying pans has been confirmed to enhance the cooling effect through insulation!
What an unexpected huge discovery!
This was a rainy season with notable amounts of rainfall not seen in previous years, and yet, as it lifts the fierce heat of summer intensifies.
The hot, hot days of scorching heat when even the air conditioner has no effect.... it's exhausting just thinking about it, isn't it?
Global warming is a worldwide problem, and humankind has racked its collective brain for how we can overcome the midsummer heat even slightly more comfortably.
One of those methods is to wear light white clothing.
There's no need to go out of your way to wear heat-absorbing black clothes in summer, right?
And it seems that the use of white paints is increasing by applying the same principle to the architecture of houses.
Though white may be white, there was the cutting-edge research whether there is yet something that could be made into a specialized paint that reflects even more light and absorbs even less heat.
Recently the Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science at the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) in collaboration with researchers from the Columbia University School of Applied Physics and Applied Mathematics, announced that they have discovered a compounding method for a white paint that most efficiently reflects solar heat and boosts the effectiveness of cooling inside buildings.
They say they are striving for early implementation.
Up until now, the white paint with the highest rate of sunlight reflection was one that was made with titanium oxide and had a reflection rate of 85%.
Paints using titanium oxide are already being painted on the roofs of buildings in high-temperature environments, and are proving useful in blocking sunlight and raising air cooling efficiency.
However, what was newly discovered is a paint based in a fluororesin from none other than polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), which is used in those Teflon-treated frying pans.
It is thought that with paint that applies this Teflon effect, almost 98% of sunlight will be reflected and it will be possible to make a substantial cut in heat.
Even in the hot summer, with the unexpected paint that uses Teflon, inside there is no exposure to the intense heat and it is so comfortable!
Maybe such an age will come soon?
It seems like there are a lot of Japanese houses with dark-colored roofs, but maybe from now on white will become mainstream?
Amazon's Large Annual Sale, When Will it be this Year?
America CNBC reported on July 21 that America's Amazon.com has revealed that their large annual sale, "Prime Day," will be postponed.
They conveyed that, though the sale is held every July, they have been forced to postpone this year due to the effects of the spread of coronavirus infections.
"Details will be announced shortly" an Amazon representative mentioned in a statement, a spokesperson said.
"For the past five years Prime Day has become a special celebratory event that we look forward to. This year, to ensure the safety of our employees while supporting our customers and sellers, we will hold it at a later date from previous years."
However, the statement ended with "details will be announced shortly" without making clear specifics about the date.
However, they have decided on holding one in India.
A press release was posted on the website for the country.
It explained that it would be held for 48 hours starting at midnight on August 6.
Until now Prime Day had been held simultaneously worldwide, however they may take unprecedented measures this year.
A 2-day 760 billion yen sales mega event, Amazon launched this large-scale sale aimed at its members in 2015 as a summertime promotion when sales are slow.
Originally a 24 hour event, the scale expanded year by year, and last year it started from midnight on July 15 for 48 hours in 18 countries including the US, Canada, the UK, Germany, France, India, Japan, China, and Australia.
According to the company, last year the sales for the two day period exceeded previous sales performance of "Black Friday" (the opening day of the year-end sales season) and "Cyber Monday" (the following Monday).
This event also contributes to the acquisition of new subscribers to the "Prime" paid membership, with the initial day last year having the most applications ever in a single day, and the second most on the following day.
Last year they sold 175 million products worldwide.
Regarding this, the online retail industry journal "Internet Retailer" announced that the total global sales amount of the two day period was 7.16 billion dollars (760 billion yen), an increase of 70% compared to the previous year.
A Critical Eye Cast Over Excessive Restrictions on Mobile Number Transfers
What will happen to fees and point allocation?
(Newswitch) - Yahoo! News
The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications is proceeding at full tilt in its decision to review the mobile number portability system (MNP), which makes it possible to use an old cell phone number as-is when changing mobile phone carriers.
At a meeting of experts on the 21st, they otulined the objective to revise the MNP guidelines, which were established in 2004.
The specific points at issue are wide-ranging, including the current state of MNP handling fees and the pros and cons of restrictions on those wishing to transfer.
With opposition expected from carriers, all eyes are on whether it will encourage healthy market competition.
It is a shady aspect of phone carriers, with unlimited mobile transfer still a long way away; when MNP was introduced in 2006, the fees customers had to pay was 2000 yen, but that has now risen to 3000 yen.
The amount of revenue the three major mobile phone carriers receive from MNP fees is estimated to exceed 15.9 billion annually.
On the 21st, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications enumerated the current circumstances surrounding MNP at the Working Group (WG) on Verification of Competition Rules, a panel of experts debating subjects like the competitive environment of the communications market.
Criticism was also levelled at the time period in which one can receive an MNP reservation number, which is necessary when a consumer transfers to another carrier.
The major carriers accept applications online, but due to circumstances such as core system operation, it is normal for applications to only be accepted between 9:00 and 20:00.
It was specified in the working group's documents that the direction of future considerations is that all-day support should be the norm.
It is also viewed as problematic that people who wish to transfer under the MNP are are bound to their mobile phone carrier through strategies such as points allocation schemes.
This comes from the judgment that excessive restrictions can only obstruct fair competition.
Partner Kita Shinichi of the Nomura Research Institute, who serves as a member of the working group, proposed, "Carriers should get customers' permission to take the time and explain the financial benefits they are offering, and those customers who do not consent should be immediately issued with MNP numbers and end it there. It is important to thoroughly ensure this process first."
However, among the series of points at issue with regard to MNP handling fees, it seems that structural problems lie ahead, as a source at the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications explains, "The more expensive they are, the harder it becomes to lose customers, so it's difficult to motivate carriers to lower them proactively."
There also are worries that if an operator emerges that takes the initiative to lower MNP handling fees, the number of users leaving that company will increase and its business efforts will not be rewarded.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications has also pointed out that in many countries overseas, carriers do not demand a fee from their customers for MNP, and it is thought that Japan could become that way as well.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications will consolidate the results of the working group in a report around September or October, and it is thought that they will want to begin procedures to revise the MNP guidelines thereafter.
If revisions are implemented, the timing will likely be in 2021 or thereafter.
This will likely cause mobile phone carriers to worry about issues including the state of sales and customer support.
Chunichi • Katsuno pitched a no-hitter through the 6th inning, but still cannot claim winning pitcher (Sankei Sports) --Yahoo! News
Chunichi pitcher Katsuno Akiyoshi (23) started the eighth game for the Hanshin Tigers (Nagoya Dome) on the 25th.
He gave up four hits but no runs in the 6th inning.
"I pitched in the last game so I thought this was my last chance. I gave up a walk, but I was still able to pitch without much distraction."
In both of the season's first game, and the previous game against Hanshin (Koshien) on the 18th, he was the starting pitcher, struggled to control his pitches and was out by the fourth inning.
Not fulfilling his role as a starting pitcher, this put him in a situation, and was hindering his ability to hang onto the starting lineup.
This time, he aggressively attacked the Dynamite Tigers' hitters with powerful pitches.
Pitching fastballs at the higher end of 140km, he was able to effectively use curve balls to mix up his pitches.
In the 6th inning, he allowed the first batter, Sands a double into left field, but retires Oyama with a popup to left and Bohr with a groundout to second base, which led to two outs and a man on 3rd base.
Pitching against Fukudome, he fires two strikes and a third pitch fork-ball.
With a strikeout on three pitches, he manages to get out of a pinch.
Katsuno finished the 6th inning with 83 pitches, but at the end of that inning, Manager Yoda came off the bench and announced a pitching change.
Nishi Yuki, playing in a pitcher's game had 108 pitches at the same time, but because he came off the mound first, could not get the rights to his first win of the season.

The Okayama Prefecture Chamber of Commerce has given a makeover to "San-san Hare No Megumi", its original brand for the certification of speciality good from the prefecture.
They have changed the name to "Hare No Megumi Okayama Brand" and established a new system for showcasing all the excellent products.
The aim is to strengthen PR.
Certification began in 2004, with the aim of cultivating a market for small businesses.
The main reason for the makeover was that 15 years have passed since its inception.
In March of this year, The Chamber of Commerce screened the products recommended by various associations of commerce and industry, and certified 22 products, including local craft sake and hats handmade by craftsmen.
This brings the lineup to 121 products in total, including 99 products inherited from the old brand, such as snacks, seasonings, and cosmetics.
The chamber of Commerce will continue to invite contributions in the future.
Products of particularly high quality are recognised with the "Best Selection Award".
This time, the award was given to Hiruzen Jersey Yogurt made by Hiruzen Dairy Farm Cooperative (Maniwa city)
Canned Kakioko by Asahi Tex (Bizen city) was selected for the Challenger Award, which goes to novel products.
Ten thousand copies of the catalog have been published, in which the various products are introduced along with photos, prices and where they are sold.
It has been sent to buyers around the country and trading companies involved in export, and tourist information centres within the prefecture are also handing the catalog out for free.
The Chamber of Commerce has also created a logo that combines a peach and a peach flower, a sticker of which can be affixed to certified products.
A representative commented, "All the products utilize local resources. We hope that the makeover will raise their profile and communicate their appeal."
Masuda Shrine, Dedicated To Police Officer Killed in the Line of Duty in the Fight Against Cholera, Cancels Regular Festival; Takakushi, Hizenmachi, Karatsu City; Only Kyo Shinto Rites Performed Due to the Impact of COVID-19  | Local Topics | Saga Shimbun News | Saga Shimbun LiVE
Masuda Shrine, dedicated to a police officer killed in the line of duty fighting against cholera: Tano, Hizenmachi, Karatsu City
A festival float of Officer Masuda on a white horse paraded around the area in July 2019: Provided by Tano, Takakushi, Hizenmachi, Karatsu city
Masuda Shrine, located in Takakushi district of Tano, Hizenmachi, Karatsu City, is dedicated to police officer Masuda Keitaro (1869-1895), who lost his life in the line of duty, working on measures against the area's infectious cholera outbreak 125 years ago.
It used to hold a lively regular festival at the end of July every year, but it was cancelled this year due to the impact of COVID-19.
Only the Shinto rites, performed by the president of the Neighborhood Association and others, will take place on the 26th.
The larger festival has always been held by the neighborhood association, consisting of a parade with a festival float of Officer Masuda on a horse as well as a fireworks display.
In normal years, the parade attracts a crowd of nearly 200 participants, including Mausda's descendants from Kumamoto prefecture, law enforcement personnel, and local residents.
Commenting that media requests for interviews have increased this year amid the COVID-19 pandemic, Neighborhood Association President Takeda Yoshitoku (72) stated, "The regular festival that brings the community together flourishes every year. The cancellation is so unfortunate."
Prefectural police also cancelled this year's memorial service, which is attended by students from the police academy.
On the 21st, Chief Director Suginai Yumiko, Karatsu Chief of Police Fukushima Hiroto, and others visited where Masuda's ashes were placed in Komatsushima, offshore from Takakushi Port, and laid flowers at the monument.
It renewed Chief Director Suginai's mindset of "a brave and self-sacrificing spirit being the central tenet of policing, and wanting to carry this on as the ideal vision."
Officer Masuda, a native of Kumamoto, was appointed to Takakushi in July 1895 (Meiji 28).
In the course of tireless efforts such as disinfecting patient's houses, he also contracted cholera himself.
He died at age 25, only four days after taking up his post, leaving behind the message "I will take on all of the cholera in Takakushi."

Betts signs 12-year contract with the Dodgers for a whopping 39.1 billion yen!
It's the second biggest contract after the Angels' Mike Trout!
It was revealed that Right fielder Mookie Betts has signed a new contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers.
He was traded to the Dodgers by the Boston Red Sox during the off-season.
This means that before the start of his first year at his new home, he is already in a contract through to 2032.
US media outlets such as CBS Sports broke the news on the 22nd (23rd, Japan time).
Video: Betts shows off a wide range of abilities with the Red Sox!
He can also do some other amazing things besides baseball!
Betts made his major league debut in 2014 at the age of 21.
He played a central role in the Boston Red Sox's strong batting lineup, and also flourished as a right fielder with a powerful throw.
From 2015 up until last season, he was the quintessential intermediate-range batter, racking up more than 40 doubles every year.
In 2018, he became the world's number one with an average of .346, batting champion and MVP.
According to CBS Sports, last year, Betts rejected a 10-year offer from the Red Sox for 300 million dollars (approximately 32.1 billion yen).
During the off-season, the Red Sox traded Betts to the Dodgers together with ace left-handed pitcher, David Price, in exchange for cash considerations and multiple players.
Betts' contract for this season is 27 million dollars (approximately 2.9 billion yen) for the year.
His new contract is for 12 years, from the 2021 season to the 2032 season, and is reported to be worth a total of 365 million dollars (approximately 39.1 billion yen).
To date, the largest contract in major league baseball went to Mike Trout, centre fielder for the Los Angeles Angels, totalling 426 million dollars (approximately 45.6 billion yen) for 12 years.
Betts' latest contract will become the second largest amount after that.
Since Betts was due to become a free agent during this off-season period, it was inevitable that there would be a fierce battle to snap him up if he ever went on the market.
His contract follows the recent trend of tying players into long-term, big-money contracts before they become free agents.
This means that in the turbulent world of major league baseball, Betts has been granted some long-term stability.

Dry eye and more explained by Dr Kinoshita Akio, Hiramatsu Hospital's head of ophthalmology, at the Saga branch of Yonezawa Glasses
Hiramatsu Hospital's head of ophthalmology, Dr Kinoshita Akio, explains dry eye and more in the Hotto Seminar at the Saga branch of Yonezawa Glasses
A Health Hotto Seminar (organised by Saga Shimbun, co-hosted by Yonezawa Glasses) was held on the 25th at the Saga branch of Yonezawa Glasses in Shimodamachi, Saga city, to provide advice from experts on various health-related issues.
Dr Kinoshita Akio, the head of ophthalmology at Hiramatsu Hospital (Ogi city), explained about dry eye, cataracts, and other eye ailments that are closely related to daily life.
He explained that dry eye, known as a tear disease, is an illness where the quality of lachrymal secretion deteriorates so it is not evenly distributed over the surface of the eye.
Dr Kinoshita said that, "Contact lens users are about four times as likely to suffer from dry eye," urging caution to "try not to use them for long periods or to sleep with them in."
He suggested measures such as lowering computer screens to below eye level and humidifying rooms where air conditioners are running.
He also introduced nutrients and foods that can be effective against dry eye.
He said, "Omega-3, which is present in foods such as oily fish, can prevent the evaporation of lachrymal fluid, and mucin, which is present in large amounts in natto and okra, can improve the quality of lachrymal fluid."
With regard to cataract surgery, he also touched on the monofocal and multifocal types of intraocular lenses inserted instead of crystalline lenses and the differences in visual performance between them.
Approximately 40 people participated in the seminar.
The seminar was split into two small group sessions, one in the morning and one in the afternoon, as a measure to prevent the spread of COVID-19, attendees also had their temperature taken and sanitised their hands before entering, and the venue was kept sufficiently ventilated.

[Gamba Osaka] 17-year-old FW Toyama, what is the possibility of J1 debut against Kobe?
Coach Miyamoto "Scoring power is outstanding" (Sports Hochi) --Yahoo! News
Gamba Osaka manager Miyamoto Tsuneyasu (43) responded to an interview on the 25th, ahead of the Kobe match (26th, Noevir Stadium), in which they will seek a fourth consecutive victory, and revealed his expectation for Toyama Shoji (17), a high school senior who joined the top team for the first time in the previous season.
The manager will keep Toyama who was promoted to the top this season, on the bench in the match against Hiroshima on the 22nd.
Although he didn't allow any chances to play, he said about the striker, who has scored 3 goals in 5 games this J3 season so far, "He has an outstanding talent to score. He's still only 17 so I want him to be rapacious. I've seen players who go abroad at a young age, but I want them to play with high mindedness and ferociousness."
Toyama scored 8 goals in 10 games in J3, in which he participated in as a specially designated player last season.
Slender at 178 cm and a 65 kg frame, he has an amazing scoring rate of 11 goals in 15 games in J3, is agile and managing to outwit the DF, and is calm to shoot even in front of the crowded opponent's goal.
In the match against Hiroshima, FW Ademilson and midfielder Onose were on the bench with injuries, and Toyama might have had a chance, but he was not played.
Coach Miyamoto explained that Ademilson and Onose's conditions are  "not 100%, but they are enthusiastically preparing for the match against Kobe."
If they are to be saved, there is a possibility Toyama maybe on the bench again.
In Gamba Osaka, midfielder Doan = current PSV = made his J1 debut at the age of 16 years and 11 months, and FW Usami at 17 years and 0 months old, and moved overseas as a teenager.
Toyama, who is now 17 years and 10 months old is expected to be the next talent, expected to make his J1 debut following in their footsteps.
Ferrari stolen 26 years ago found at the bottom of a river, to be put on display as is without being restored (octane.jp) - Yahoo!News
In Holland in 1994, a crime was committed in which a Ferrari Mondial was stolen.
The police had no leads, and the case remained unsolved for many years, until one day, 26 years later, the Mondial was miraculously discovered.
The Ferrari found at the bottom of the river (4 photos) A fire department doing diver training nearby led to the car's discovery.
On July 8th, a diver training in the river discovered something wedge-shaped on the riverbed, police and even the Dutch army were called the scene, and what they pulled out of the river was the Ferrari Mondial.
By checking the vehicle identification number against the stolen vehicle database, they were able to link this Ferrari with the 1994 robbery.
The car was handed over to its legal owner, an insurance company, after which it was sent to a scrapyard.
Scrapyard owner Lowie van De Ooyevaar said, "There's still quite a few remaining parts, so they'll be put to use as decorative artworks. I've already received a lot of requests from people who want to make tables from dismantled parts of the Mondial. We will make them with the engine block and glass."
For the time being, Ooyevaar does not have a concrete plan to sell any of the artworks he will create, merely to display them at the scrapyard.

" The man who doesn't have" has finally done it!
(Sankei Sports) --Yahoo! News
(Pacific League, the 24th, Seibu 3x-2 vs Lotte, 9th inning, Seibu six wins, three losses, at MetLife) A determined win!!

The team has made unanimous effort to win with a two game lead.
The Leo fans with high energy packing into their home base, MetLife Dome, reached its climax.
Tonosaki hits his first walk off in his sixth year as a pro.
It excited a crowd of 4,825 people.
"Gen (Genda) and Tomoya (Mori) made the lead that connected me, so I stepped onto the box with an intention of making it happen." His teammates' efforts inspired the number five, leading to victory.
The score was 2-2 at the top of the 9th.
The first batter, Genda, tried to bunt and slid head first into first base with determination.
After getting on base with an infield hit, Mori, the number one hitter last season, decided to make his second sacrifice bunt.
The number four hitter, Yamakawa was intentionally walked.
His senior teammate at Fuji University was walked, and Tonosaki was furious.
"I thought damn. Before Yamakawa went to first base, he said to me, "be aggressive," so I felt really good."
After the first ball, he got jammed with a high fastball inside, but the ball dropped just into the left field.
Even during his amateur days, he has no recollection of a walk off hit.
The 27-year-old, inspired by his alma mater, Hirosaki Jitsugyo High School (Aomori), advancing to the top four of the summer prefectural tournament for the first time in 20 years, smiled and said "As you would expect, it felt amazing" taking a water shower of joy.
He has been called "The man who doesn't have it."
He was selected by SAMURAI JAPAN as a versatile player who can defend the infield and outfield, and contributed to the win to become world's number 1 at the "Premier 12" last November.
However, as a Seibu player, he had never experienced hitting a walk-off, and was teased by Manager Tsuji and Baba, the strategy, defense, and base running coach that "you just don't have it."
Bouncing back from the negative reputation, he produced the second walk-off win this season.
Director Tsuji praised saying, "I asked the goddess of victory, just for today. And he's made a good hit."
Leading with two wins, they are in third place, one game behind the leader, Softbank.
With only one home run this season, Tonosaki with a batting average of .252, said with enthusiasm, "I still have to hit. We will work as one team to win the next one."
This winning hit will determine a chance for a come back.

Chunichi Dragons' Takahashi makes a contribution even though he is put out: "I want to recover as soon as possible" (Sankei Sports) - Yahoo!News
(Central League, 25th, Nagoya Dome: Chunichi 1-0 Hanshin, 8 innings, 4 wins, 4 losses) Infielder Takahashi Shuhei (26), who had been away from the action after tearing the rear muscle of his left thigh, appeared as a pinch hitter in the 7th innings of a game against the Hanshin Tigers on the 25th, with one batter out and one on second base.
He was grounded out on his way to second base.
Leadoff batter Fukuda got on base with a hit out to the front of centre field, and first draft pick Ishikawa Takaya (Toho High School) made a sacrificial bunt in front of the pitcher, putting him out but getting Fukuda to second base.
It was at this point that uniform number 3, who has just been elevated to that position, made his appearance.
There was a big cheer from the Chunichi fans filling the seats at Nagoya Dome.
His bat connected with Nishi Yuka's first-pitched slider and he was grounded out, but with the minimum of effort, this resulted in two out and player at third base, followed by a shortstop infield hit from Iryo.
"Obviously, hitting the ball would be the ideal, but I'm glad that Iryo hit the ball and got us a point," said Takahashi, delighted.
It was originally estimated that it would be three to four weeks before he returned, but he made a speedy recovery in just two weeks.
Manager Yoda also commented, saying, "I think (his condition) is at about 70-80%. I mean obviously only Takahashi himself knows how he feels, but that's the sense I get from watching him, and yet, he's made a far speedier recovery than I expected. I didn't have any particular concerns about the way he ran after hitting the ball either, so, if he gradually gets used to it, then I think it won't be long until he's in the starting lineup."
Takahashi himself seemed resolute, saying, "I want to hurry up and regain what I lost when I was out of action."
A dependable captain supports his team.
Heavy Rains Disrupt Hokuen Traffic, 10km of National Route 152 Closed, Some Sections of the JR Iida Line Closed | Shizuoka Shimbun At-S
National Route 152 was subject to a total road closure, with lines of vehicles waiting to take the detour, where one side of the road was closed and traffic could only pass at alternate intervals: At Tatsuyamacho, Tenryu ward, Hamamatsu City, on the afternoon of the 22nd (Photo partially altered)
July's heavy rains caused severe damage in Kyushu and other parts of Japan, and even in Shizuoka prefecture, the Tenryu area of Hamamatsu city was particularly affected.
Landslides have affected National Route 152, a major road, and the JR Iida Line, many people's daily mode of transport, and many places still need time for recovery.
It has not only been an inconvenience in the lives of local residents, but has also caused worries about the negative impact on economic activity.
During the day, there are long lines of vehicles waiting to cross Sejiri Bridge, which spans the Tenryu River in the Tatsuyamacho part of the city.
Vehicles at the front had been stopped for close to 40 minutes.
Approximately 10km of National Route 152 has been subject to a total road closure, necessitating a detour to the opposite bank of the Tenryu River in order to be able to get around town.
However, the road is narrow and, along the whole section, traffic can only pass on one side at alternate intervals, so waiting times are unpredictable.
In the town, a landslide occured on the National Highway on the 9th, and the road was closed due to the risk of falling rocks from the nearby slope.
On the 13th, cracks were found in Akiba tunnel, which is within the town's jurisdiction, but no estimates have yet been made as to when it will reopen to traffic.
The town also saw the closure of the National Highway in 2018 due to landslides, negatively impacting local life and tourism.
Tamamoto Kimie (76), CEO of the Dragon Mama Food Processing Plant, which sells local specialities, said wistfully, "We've been dealt another blow at a time when we've already lost a lot of business due to COVID-19. The number of customers has dropped significantly."
Due to the collapsed bank beside the railroad track, the JR Iida Line has been cut off between Misakubo Station (in the ward's Misakubocho town) and Hiraoka Station (Nagano prefecture).
Ukai Shiori (16), who was commuting to Shizuoka Prefecture Hamamatsukohoku High School Sakuma Branch, in the ward's Sakuma town, via Ozore Station (in the same town), which is in the cut-off section, now needs to be dropped off and picked up by car, about an hour each way.
"Going by car is a big burden on my parents and on me," she says, hoping for early recovery.
According to JR Central, they anticipate that it will take about three months to reopen the section of track, and, starting from the 27th, there will be a special train service making round trips between Misakubocho Station and Ozore Station, with one train in the morning and in the evening on weekdays.
In Misakubocho, where forest roads also serve as roads for people's daily coming and going, landslides are a frequent occurrence.
Detours can sometimes take several hours.
The Misakubo Forestry Association Chairman Keiji Kumagai (69) commented with a gloomy expression, "Log removal is delayed too. There are isolated places all over, like islands. I'm worried about future rains."
Was Nakajima Shoya's Absence from the Victory Ceremony His Own Choice?
Local Media Reports (Football Channel) - Yahoo! News
It appears that Nakajima Shoya, a midfielder on the Japanese national team, is leaning toward leaving Porto.
So reported Portugal's ZAP based on information from Récord.
Porto, which commanded the Portugal league in the 2019-2020 season, held a victory ceremony on the pitch at the end of their last home game on the 20th of the month.
However, Nakajima was not present at this location, spurring discussion.
Nakajima, who refused to train together with his teammates during the league suspension due to COVID-19, has continued to be absent since then.
Amid this, he was also absent from the victory ceremony, leading to rumors of a transfer this summer.
According to Récord, Porto had invited Nakajima to the ceremony.
However, it seems that Nakajima simply did not make an appearance.
For that reason, they wrote that "Nakajima has been increasingly removed from Coach Sérgio Conceição's plans for next season. There's a need for him to leave the club at the next transfer window."
Nakajima is a prestigious player for Portugal and wears the number 10 on his back, but it is very likely that he will leave the team within the next year.
He may have already started the search for a new club.
A ring of light and a horizontal rainbow: solar halo and circumhorizontal arc observed in the sky over Yamagata | Yamagata Newspaper
A rainbow-coloured circumhorizontal arc appearing under a solar halo encircling the sun - 8:43am on the 24th, near Takado, Yamagata
Two weather phenomena appeared together over Yamagata just before 9am on the 24th: a solar halo, which looks like a ring of light encompassing the sun, and a circumhorizontal arc, which is a rainbow-coloured band of light.
According to a source at the Yamagata Meteorological Observatory, both the solar halo and the circumhorizontal arc result from sunlight hitting fine ice crystals within a cloud and being bent or reflected.
A normal rainbow can be seen when the sun is behind you, but a peculiar feature of a circumhorizontal arc is that it appears in the same direction that the sun is in.
While solar halos are a relatively common occurrence, circumhorizontal arcs do not appear anywhere near as frequently.
On this day, the solar halo could also be seen in Takahata.
Takeda Chieko (75) a housewife from Fukuzawa, Takahata, was in her house around 11am, when her daughter mentioned that there was a strange rainbow in the sky, so went to have a look for herself.
It was visible for around 20 minutes, and Takeda said with a smile on her face, "It's the first time I've seen anything like it. I was slightly worried that it might be a bad omen, but I'm glad that I got to see something so rare."

Doctors Arrested in Connection with Contract Killing Communicated with Patient via Social Media, Instructed to Delete Messages | Shizuoka Shimbun At-S
Suspect Okubo Yoshikazu (back right), sent to the prosecutor hanging his head; Nakagyo Police Station, Kyoto, 1:57pm on the 24th
In the case in which two doctors - including suspect Okubo Yoshikazu (42) of Izumi ward, Sendai - were arrested on suspicion of murder at the victim's request, allegedly killing a female patient of theirs with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), an incurable disease which causes the muscles of the whole body to gradually weaken, by administering a drug at her request, it was revealed on the 24th in an interview with investigators that the suspect Okubo had been instructed by the woman to kill her in correspondence that they had on a members-only social networking site (SNS) up until the day of the incident.
Kyoto prefectural police are looking into the detailed sequence of events, surmising that the suspect Okubo tried to destroy the evidence in fear that his involvement would be discovered.
It appears that the suspect Okubo and the woman began a correspondence on social media around December 2018, but had not met until the day of the incident.
45% of wives are in charge of the household finances!
Are their husbands happy? Or are they discontent?
I'm sure we all know someone who is surprised or angry when their husband complains that they're low on spending money this month?
This kind of conversation occur in households where the wife is in charge of the household finances.
But in what percentage of households do wives hold the purse strings in today's society?
We'll also take a look at the proportion of households in which husbands and wives handle their finances separately, and the proportion in which they jointly manage their finances.
Who is in charge of household finances?
Matsui Securities conducted an online survey of 800 married couples across the country - 400 young couples in their 20s-30s who have been married for up to 3 years, and 400 middle-aged couples in their 50s-60s who have been married for 30 years or more - on the subject of the management of household finances among married couples (results announced in June of 2020), from which the following findings were made.
Who is in charge of household finances?
Wife: 45.0%, husband: 24.8% - the finding was that households where the wife is in charge of the household finances are the most common.
Managing the household finances can be complicated whoever is in charge, but it seems that it can lead to a range of different episodes.
When the wife manages the household finances: take the case of A-san, a working mother around 50 who has two daughters, a freshman and a senior, in high school.
A-san is in full control of the household finances.
As her eldest was preparing to take university entrance exams, the exam prep centre fees racked up, resulting in more than a few months in the red, so A-san discussed reducing her husband's spending money, which he naturally resisted.
At that time, A-san's husband asked to see what their income and expenditures were, so A-san showed him the household accounting book.
All the expenses should have been recorded, but when they checked the household accounting book, there was not enough to cause them to go into the red.
A-san's husband said, "We have enough," and almost managed to get his way, so A-san impulsively declared, "Okay, I'm in over my head managing the household finances, so can you please handle everything," which led her husband to say, "I think I'll leave it to you after all."
When quizzed about this later, A-san's husband told her, "Although it's true that I'm not happy with the way that my spending money is controlled, to be honest, I don't have the time or energy to manage the various household expenses (for instance expenses for school supplies and PTA expenses)."
When the husband manages the household finances: B-san, a full-time housewife, is given living expenses by her husband, on which she has to get by every day.
Last spring, the freezer section of the refrigerator broke, so B-san asked her husband to buy a new fridge.
However, her husband was reluctant to buy a new one, saying, "It's still fine to use, only the freezer part is broken."
However, when the summer came round, B-san's husband apparently wanted to be able to eat ice cream whenever he fancied and decided that maybe they should buy a new fridge after all.
Recounting the episode to a friend, B-san complained that her husband is "stingy with a capital S".
Kubo Takefusa Transfer Team Narrowed Down to 5 Clubs in Spain's Premiere League (Tokyo Sports Web) - Yahoo!News
Transfer appears to be steadily narrowing down for Japan representative mid fielder Kubo Takefusa (19), who played in Spain's Mallorca in La Liga this season.
Though Mallorca was demoted to the second-division league, recognition swiftly rose for Kubo's active role in the final stages.
However, because of the limit on players from outside of the EU, it will be difficult for him to return to Real Madrid which is also in La Liga and has "retention rights," so due to this he plans to play with other clubs again this season.
Offers have already come in from around 30 clubs, but Real Madrid plans to have him train at clubs within the country.
The Spanish newspaper "Marca" announced that La Liga clubs Real Sociedad, Villarreal, Granada, Getafe, and Real Betis, are likely to be Kubo's transfer location and that these "5 clubs have interest in acquiring Kubo, but Real Madrid is hoping for a club that is above the average rank in the league."
Among these Villarreal and Real Sociedad qualify to appear in next season's Europa League (EL), and Granada will also participate in the EL from the second round qualifying match, meeting Real Madrid's team requirements.
What kind of decision will the world's number one big club make for this departure of "Japan's Treasure"?
