CanCam.jp - Yahoo!News
A layer is added to the heavy semi-long hair to give it a soft, all-natural look.
CanCam model, "Of course it's beautiful, but I'm very professional and I respect it!"I have an admiration for Minami Tanaka's hairstyle with movement.
Actually Tanaka Minami's haircut, the hair salon in Omotesando "SUNVALLY" of Asahikari Teru asked me to make "Minami-style hair".
Report the cutting process!
Nogizaka 46 Mizuki Yamashita, short hair becomes the first cover!
First of all, check the hair before the cut.
It's thin, soft, and more.
There is a custom, especially in the rainy season, to wear a straight parka because it will be dazzling.
It is a heavy semi-long with flowing forehead.
Finally, the cut begins!
To make it easier to cut, first lightly wet the whole.
Afterwards, the top of the bee (the part above the area around the head that is the most exposed) is separated and cut from the bottom.
By the way, here is the point of hair that brings you closer to Minami-san!
1 TABLE BUNG Simply shorten the inside of your forehead a little to make it thicker when fully unfolded and seamless when lightly divided.
2 Making the most of your haircut If you lose too much hair, it can spread easily.
While discussing the balance around it, keep the balance such that it is easy to handle and difficult to spread, and your own swell lives.
3 Layers and hair around the face Layers are cut with a step.
If you put a layer around the face, it becomes easier to move, and a cute finish.
If you make curly hair in the three places before and behind the comb, it looks stylish even when you put it together quickly.
When I cut the hair on the bee that I had separated, I cut it around my face.
Pull out the upper part of the hair around the face and cut the tip of the hair gently.
In this way, when you lower the hair, there is a step and it is easier to move (this is the layer cut).

In recent years, the Tsuruoka Police Department (Director Kagezo Sato) has launched the "Zero Bicycle Accidents Operation" in an effort to eliminate bicycle and motorcycle-related accidents, which account for a high proportion of incidents within the department.
In addition to promoting awareness of accident prevention with traffic safety organizations within the jurisdiction, the government will work to strengthen the enforcement of violations of bicycle traffic rules.
This year, three traffic fatalities occurred in the department, and a person who was driving a motorcycle or bicycle died.
Although the number of accidents is on a decreasing trend, the percentage of accidents involving bicycles is about 11.7% as of June 30, and the percentage of accidents involving bicycles is about 5.8%, both of which are higher than the prefectural average.
In particular, the percentage of bicycle accidents in the past five years has been higher than the average in the prefecture, and we planned a strategy to break through this situation.
The name of the operation was changed to "bike" and "bicycle" to avoid accidents.
More than ever, relevant organizations will be encouraged to provide driving instruction to the elderly and use night-light reflectors in traffic safety classrooms.
The station issued a yellow card (instructional warning card) to warn people to be careful.
The opening ceremony of the operation was held at the Shoko Gakuen Automobile Training Center in Tsuruoka City on October 21.
Approximately 30 people attended, and Mr. Sato said, "I would like to ask for your cooperation to reduce even one tragic accident."
The head of the office explained the policy and the activities of each organization.
Cycling classes will continue to be held as a starting event for the operation.
They demonstrated how different the impacts on the bicycles were when the policeman in the car hit the bicycle with the brake on and when the policeman hit the bicycle without stepping on the brake at a speed of about 55 kilometers per hour.
Koichi Kanauchi, Chairman of the Tsuruoka District Regional Traffic Safety Activity Promotion Committee, said, "I have once again realized the horror of traffic accidents, and I would like to call attention not only to the elderly, but also to young people."

Mr. Kisuke said, "My voice has been in tune for a long time now, but it was a fulfilling time."
The guest rakugo performer Katsura Kodome (31) from Osaka City and the magic group Tsuyama Magic Dokokai also performed.

"Thinking is not Lukey's," Butler once again praises Tyler Hero, the young warrior who will shape the future of heat ( Basketball Count ) - Yahoo!News
Photo by Getty Images Heat's first practice game was against the Kings.
In the 104–98 victory, Duncan Robinson scored 18 points for Team High, followed by Tyler Hero with 15 points and a backcourt touchdown.
Robinson, the league's leading shooter, as well as rookie and hero step-up of the 13th overall draft is an important element for Heat.
The hero missed 15 games between February and March due to an ankle injury, ending the season with a long suspension at the end of the season with a return game against the Hornets on 12 March.
The hero says, "I had plenty of time to get back in 100% condition, which is the best feeling I've ever felt," but the performance on the scrampage was more convincing than words.
The hero's playing time increased due to the late arrival of Kendrick Nan, the starting point guard, and he took advantage of that opportunity.
It's worth a lot because it's 15 points and it's done a great job in a different role than usual.
Team leader Jimmy Butler once again praised the "Favorite" hero.
"He can be a handler, he can be a scorer, he can be a defender, he can do anything for the team, he can do anything in any position because it's not his way of thinking, he's looking at the video, he's studying, he's figuring out where and how his teammates are going to be free, and he's figuring out what to do about it."
Before the start of the season, Butler liked the heroic strength of the losers and the stoic attitude to basketball.
That's why I invited them to start their individual practice at 4 a.m. and trained with them.
Butler once said, "He says what he thinks to everyone, he doesn't back down, and I respect that kind of fighting spirit."
It's the kind of guy who always says what he thinks, and if he thinks it's for the team, he knows that a clash will happen, and he'll hammer out tough opinions.
There have been times in the past when the relationship with my teammates has deteriorated as a result.
Butler seems to have overlaid his youthful self with heroes.
The character of Butler, who is sometimes too harsh for his teammates, is a good guideline for those who have enough guts to come up with it.
If the relationship between the two mentors, who respect each other, spreads to the whole team, Heat should be a team that can aim even higher.

Shimada Sho started the game with a two-point timed hit by Matsuura in the first inning.
He scored two more points in Goro Uchino and Squires.
At the start of the game, Saito scored six goals in a single innings, giving him an unbeaten run.
Hamamatsu-jo Castle Kitako did not make use of the opportunity of the last two dead bases.
four rounds led by three years
2 years Matsuura, thanksgiving first strike
It was his fourth appearance in two years and his first appearance this summer.
Shimada Sho's Matsuura hit the change ball in the first inning and carried it to the left front.
"If I lost for three years, I would retire immediately.I wanted to let myself beat and win."
Last autumn, the outstanding player who took the fourth position was excited.
The first and second rounds were contested over three days, and the third round was contested over two days.
Director Ikeda gathered the players at the meeting and told Nain, "Three years have brought us together and I'm going to be the best member in the future."
On this day, four of the nine Stamens solidified the main axis in two years.
It's proof that he's committed to a serious fight, even though he's shown contempt.
Matsuura said, "From now on, the level of the opponent's pitcher will also rise.I intend to return the runner."
Saito, who became a regular pitcher, threw a good run that kept him from hitting even a second base six times, which made him look like a three-year-old.
Back number 10 is a positive response as a synergy effect, "If it leads to victory, it will be stimulated for three years by coming out for two years."
The team that has been aiming for the fourth place for three consecutive years, including the Shizuoka tournament until last year, does not intend to make memories of the remaining matches.
16 musicians from Fukushima Prefecture gather to sing with locals (Fukushima Minpo) - Yahoo!News
I want to bring the cheerful singing voice of Hama, Naka and Aizu to the world.
Sixteen musicians associated with Fukushima Prefecture gathered together and composed a message song.
The lyrics depict Fukushima Prefecture struggling to recover from the Great East Japan Earthquake and TEPCO's Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant accident, and the struggle against a new type of coronavirus.
By the summer of next year, which will mark the tenth anniversary of the earthquake and tsunami, the full version will be completed.
The song was later released on YouTube.
The song is titled "Pray from Fukushima".
The positive attitude of the people is put on a cheerful and energetic melody with the thought that "I want to convey from Fukushima."
Due to the influence of the new colonna, the live house, which became the base of musical activity, was forced to close down, and many musicians lost the opportunity to sing and perform.
In order to believe in the power of music, singer-songwriter nappo (46 years old), who lives in Minamisoma City, and DAZU-O (37 years old), of the music group "Mehikari Boys" of Iwaki City, organized the event.
Nappo is in charge of lyrics and composition, and Dazo is in charge of rap.
When the project started in March, singer-songwriter MANAMI (28) and Jun Sugano (38) from Fukushima City agreed one after another, and the circle expanded in an instant.
Mr. Nappo said, "It was a gorgeous face-to-face encounter that is unthinkable in ordinary times, and I want to enjoy this opportunity to the fullest."
Sixteen people did not have the opportunity to gather as a countermeasure to the infection, and each recorded at a live house or at home.
In an effort to support the project, a painter from Iwaki City drew an image of the character.
Following Fukushima Prefecture, it expresses a naturally rich climate of blue and green.
The song was released on YouTube, and is also available on CD.
Next year marks the tenth anniversary of the earthquake, and the Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games, which were postponed, are also scheduled to be held.
"We've overcome a lot of difficulties, and I'm happy to be able to encourage many people by releasing a song at a turning point," said Dazoo.
Other participating musicians are as follows.

[Picture] Specialized team determines the truthfulness of social media information with alerts from Specti
Now, the means by which people first learn about the occurrence of disasters and accidents has begun to shift from television to online information (social media).
Social media, such as Twitter, has become an important medium for disseminating information immediately after a disaster or accident occurs.
However, it is difficult to keep an eye on the overflowing information and extract useful information from it manually.
Specti detects information about natural disasters and accidents from social media such as Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook, analyzes the content, determines the truthfulness of the information, and distributes it to the user companies.
"We consider a wide range of events that have a negative impact on social activities to be 'crisis'" (Murakami Kenjiro, CEO), a crisis management support service that visualizes various crises occurring in Japan and overseas.
NHK's use of Specti during the Kumamoto earthquake in April 2016 was the first major use of Specti, and subsequently, recruitment movements spread rapidly among companies.
Not only TV stations and newspapers, but also companies that support social infrastructure such as electricity, gas, and transportation, as well as local governments throughout Japan, are now using Specti.
Analyze the post to determine the type of "crisis" and the place where it occurred
Specti delivers information in four steps: "Collection of information", "Analysis and classification of content", "Title assignment", and "Truthfulness judgement".
Companies that use the system must specify in advance the region in which the information is to be collected (e.g., prefectures, municipalities), and the category of crisis (e.g., disasters and accidents).
Specti collects posts that fall under its designation using an API provided by social media.
It then analyzes and categorizes the text, images, and videos contained in the collected posts.
For example, if there is a video showing a fire engine, black smoke rising from a building, and an orange flame from a room, it is classified as a "fire".
In addition, images of vehicles that have rolled over are classified as "traffic accidents" and images of roads covered with water are classified as "road crown water".
Specti also estimates the location of disasters and accidents.
"We often don't know the location from the post, so we're combining various information to make an estimate," says Murakami.
For example, if a road sign or signboard is projected onto an image or video, information about the place name is extracted from it and matched with the place name database to identify the location.

○ Athletics 7x - 3 Angels ● <Local time July 24, Oakland Coliseum> Shohei Otani (26) of the Angels on July 24 (Japan time 25) in the opening game against the Athletics in the enemy's territory with the "third-best striker" in the stadium.
In the first round, he scored his first goal of the season, but was relegated to the fourth round after scoring five goals and one assist.
Otani faced Montana again on three occasions, losing on the first base.
In the third inning of the 5–1 series, he lost to second-inning right-handed Peter Pettit in the first inning, where he also fell to Yugoslav.
In the fourth inning of the eighth inning, which was 2-1 and 1 point lead, he faced the fifth left-handed Dickman as the starting batsman.
The second ball went straight backwards at a good angle, but it didn't go over the fence and fell to the left.
In the eighth setback, where the Angels took the lead with one point, Batley's right-handed rescuer lost two points and allowed for a reversal, but the table of the last nine setbacks and the newly joined catcher, No. 7 Castro, will be the team's number one solo ball to the right wing seat.
He scored 3–3 on aggregate.
He then scored two runs and two touchdowns in the second inning.
Athletics Bench called Traut out of the game and selected Otani with two dead bases.
It was Otani who was expected to win the game, but three hits before the guardian of the athletics God Hendrix.
The game did not end in 9 games, and entered the extended game starting from the second base of this season's special non-death.
He was the last player to score nine goals in a row.
In the tenth inning of the game, the first baseman, Walsh, threw a heavy first base ball, but the first baseman, Olson, who caught the ball, sent it to third base.
The second and third floors of the building were occupied by the railway.
The Angels then went on to score two dead bases, but in the end the 8th-seeded Simons were defeated by two goals.
On the other hand, the Angels had a second and third base pinch after Robles, who continued to pitch across the inning, died in a dead ball and a throwout.
Here, Maddon's new manager makes a shift to five infielders, but Robles walks the fourth Davis with four balls to full base.
Milner's left-handed substitute delivered a good-bye full-base hit to Olson 5 on the right wing to determine the game.
Thirty-three households and 56 people in Takaki Village will be temporarily bridged by increased water (NBS Nagano Broadcasting) - Yahoo!News
In Nagano Prefecture, heavy rains are expected in the southern part of the prefecture over the next 26 days, and the central and southern parts of the prefecture need to be vigilant against landslides.
In Qiaoki Village, the circuit of the prefectural road that is closed to traffic has been discharged, and the residents are isolated again.
Soil and temporary bridges were drunk on the flooded river, and it flowed.
After 3:00 a.m., Iida Construction Office caught a surveillance camera installed in Takatoki Village.
Instead of the prefectural road, which was closed due to landslides, this circuit was built on the banks of a river, and from the 17th, it was only accessible to residents' cars.

It is a Chiba people near Tokyo.
I have been living in the same prefecture for about 30 years since I was born.
When I used it in a conversation with a friend at a university (Tokyo), I was instantly annoyed.
You could understand the meaning by the flow and the sense of words, but people in Tokyo and Saitama prefectures said that they would not use it.
i'm sure it's going to be a mess.
It seems to be connected with it, so the meaning can be guessed somehow.

Although I didn't notice this because it was pointed out, the expression "Uchinchi," which means "my home," was not used at all even when I read books and so on, and I had to ask my friends not to do so, so when I became an adult, I researched it and it was a dialect.
eh, was that so?
I also use it in my hometown (Gunma Prefecture), but I didn't realize it because I didn't use it naturally after becoming an adult ... ... .
Japanese "cold Chinese" is not Chinese Uke ... ?
"Cold noodle dishes" unpopular wake (Modern Business) - Yahoo!News
In China, cold Chinese noodles are called 'Japanese cold noodles.'
As mentioned at the beginning, cold Chinese is a Chinese dish (Japanese-style Chinese) originating in Japan, which was invented based on the Chinese "sweet mixed noodles (Lyanbanmien / cold mixed soba)".
Thus, although it does not originally exist in China, due to the diversification of food, it has come to be seen in Japanese restaurants in the summer.
Recently, Japanese convenience stores have also introduced "Japanese buckwheat cold noodles / buckwheat cold noodles Chinese" and "Kawako chicken silk cold noodles / Sichuan style chicken cold noodles Chinese".
On the other hand, the popularity of Japanese-style Chinese cuisine in China is not high on the whole, as it is dominated by popular punchy Chinese cuisine such as Sichuan cuisine and Hunan cuisine.
Of course, Japanese-Chinese flavoring is often familiar to Chinese people as well.
Therefore, it is not tasty, but it tends to be criticized as lacking in impact.
"Cold Chinese" is no exception, and is still a minor presence in China.
Incidentally, the name of cold Chinese noodles in China is "Japanese cold noodles".
For Chinese people, it is recognized as one of Japanese cuisine.
The summer classic is "Liang Pei."
Speaking of noodle dishes that feel summer in China, it is "Liang Pei".
I think many people in Japan are unfamiliar with it, but Liang Pei is a flat noodle made from flour, rice flour, starch, etc. originated in Shaanxi Province.
It is said to have a history of more than 2000 years.
It is a staple of B-class gourmet food sold at stalls, and the price is very reasonable around 10 to 20 yuan (150 to 300 yen).
It contains the character '涼', but like Japanese cold Chinese, it is not made with ice.
Rather, constant temperature is the fundamental.
On top of the noodles, pickled cucumbers, carrots, boiled peanuts and other ingredients of your choice are topped with spices such as parsley, pepper, ginger and garlic.
Finally, it is finished with a special seasoning mixed with soy sauce, soybean oil, vinegar, sesame paste and peanut paste.
The noodles are good for passing through the throat, and the sour and rich spicy sauce is well intertwined with the pulling noodles, and even when you don't have appetite for summer batter, they stick to you.
In addition, because it is permeating all over China, there are various toppings and flavorings, and the abundance of variations is also a characteristic of cool skin, and it is one of the ways to enjoy.

Cool water shower benefits body and mind (Cosmopolitan) - Yahoo!
suppresses inflammation, such as muscle pain.
A study published in The North American Journal of Medical Sciences investigating the efficacy of hydrotherapy (a water-based treatment) has shown that it can be expected to have both physical and mental healing effects.
By bathing in cold water after exercise, muscle pain and other inflammatory effects can be suppressed.
"It's important to exercise and take a cold shower as early as possible," says Douglas Cassa, head of the Korey Stringer Institute for Sports Medicine and professor at the University of Connecticut.
relieves fatigue.
When you exercise in high temperatures, your heart, muscles, and skin need more blood flow than usual.
"When you exercise, your heart rate increases, so your blood flow to the heart increases, and your muscles need energy to contract, so your blood flow to your muscles increases.As for your skin, your blood flows to regulate your body temperature," says Professor Casa.
"Breathing a cold water shower lowers the skin's temperature, reducing blood flow to the skin; instead, it sends blood to internal organs such as the stomach and intestines, making it easier for the body to absorb moisture and nutrients after exercise, thereby reducing the fatigue felt after exercise."
Expectations for the Homicidal Effect
Dr. Drozhevsky also explains that by bathing in cold water, we can expect the "hormicity effect" to be activated.
The term holistic effect refers to the idea that there should be little or no harmful substances or stress in the body, rather than nothing at all.
"Low-oxygen exercise, a bit of fasting and a cold shower are examples of the holistic effects that can be expected for good health.By taking a cold shower, hormones and neurotransmitters can be stimulated, and physical and physical strength and resilience can be enhanced."

At the end of the game, he scored a goal in the first time in 23 innings (he also scored a goal in one inning on the way down) in the Nagoya Dome, and did not pass the game.
Director Yano also expressed his expectation for a further explosion, saying, "It's a high level to be able to hold a sweet ball firmly.I'm looking at it and it's stylish, and the timing of hitting has an atmosphere even in fouls.I think it will still hit."
He scored one right-handed goal in six consecutive games, and scored three right-handed goals in three games.
The season started off well, with seven home runs and 16 assists, making him the team's fourth-highest scorer.
For the sake of victory, we will continue to leave results from now on.

Macau Casino Supervisory Authority Inspects the Implementation of Anti-Epidemic Measures at Casino Facilities...Presentation of a New-type Coronavirus Negative Certificate at Entry Required (Macao Shimbun) - Yahoo!News
About 40 casinos in Macau were closed for 15 days from February 5 to 19 due to the outbreak of the new-generation cholera virus (COVID-19).
The Macau Casino Regulatory Authority (DICJ) requires the operating company to protect the health of employees and guests to the maximum extent when reopening, ensuring the distance between gaming (casino) tables, opening adjacent seats in table games (e.g. Baccarat tables can seat three to four people at the same time), and operating slot machines once or twice to reduce the risk of cross-infection.
Disinfection of gaming equipment such as chips is also being strengthened.
Guests are also required to wear a mask at the time of entry, have a thermometer, and present a valid health code (including a recent residence record, contact history with a newborn colonist, symptoms such as fever and cough, and contact information generated by entering the code).
From 0 a.m. on July 15, a negative certificate of a new type of coronavirus nucleic acid test (limited to those issued by a licensed facility in Macao or Guangdong) was also required.
The new requirement to present a negative certificate is based on the relaxation of the boundary measures between Macao and Guangdong Province (with the abolition of quarantine quarantine for 14 days, subject to certain conditions) from 6 a.m. on the 15th, as a precautionary measure.
On July 18, DICJ announced that following the change in admission conditions from July 15, DICJ Director General Adriano Ho inspected the implementation of anti-epidemic measures at the casino facilities and held a meeting with representatives of the security departments of six casino operators to reiterate their request to protect the health of employees and guests by thoroughly managing guest admission.
The DICJ has indicated that it will continue to conduct strict patrols of the casino facilities, hold regular meetings with the operating companies in accordance with the situation and evaluation, and coordinate the anti-epidemic measures at the casinos as appropriate in accordance with the guidelines of the Government Health Bureau.
Dr. Hayashimatsu, director of the Center for Disease Surveillance and Prevention of the Hygiene Bureau, accompanied the visitors to the casino and gave them instructions on the disinfection of gaming chips and how to keep a safe distance between the seats of electronic casino equipment.
Due to a sharp decline in inbound passengers due to anti-epidemic measures including entry restrictions, cumulative casino sales from January to June this year remained at 337.20 billion Macao pataca, down 77.4% from the same period of the previous year (approximately 451.9 billion yen).
A message to healthcare workers from Yuwaku Onsen (Kitakuni Shimbun) - Yahoo!News
In Yuwaku Onsen, where the annual Yuwaku Bonbori Festival has been cancelled due to the effects of a new type of coronavirus, efforts to encourage bonbori with messages of support for healthcare workers will begin on August 1.
Around 350 sheets of paper drawn up by fans and local residents from all over the country are hung in a flash, wrapping the town of Yu with the light of ale, and delivering healing to visitors.
The Bonbori Festival is an event that recreates the festival that appears in the anime "Hanasaki Kuroha" based on Yuwaku Onsen, and is organized by the Yuwaku Onsen Tourism Association.
It began in 2011 when anime was broadcast, and every year, many anime fans from all over the country come to visit.
Every year, from the lighting ceremony in July to the main festival in October, a candle is lit on the stairs leading to Yuwaku Inari Shrine next to Soyu.
This year, the festival was forced to be cancelled due to the new corona, but local and national fans said "I am lonely that there is no fog in the summer of Yuwaku" one after another, and the association devised this project.
He called it the "Recovery Campaign" in order to help heal and recover the world from the scourge of the corona.
So far, about 50 students from Yuwaku and Shibahara have written messages with illustrations, and there have been more than 100 entries from all over Japan.
Message papers can be purchased from the Association's homepage, filled in, and sent to the Association in a reply envelope.
For a set of 6,000 yen, applications are accepted until the total number of bonbori reaches about 350.
The lights will be on until the end of November.
Mr. Shinichiro Yamashita, 48, who has served as the festival's executive committee chairman since the first festival, said, "Reading the message encourages us, too, and we want to hold the festival, which will be the 10th milestone, in a grand way next year."

"Moriyama Gaigen," of which Seibu is proud, showed the cooperation of the soul and directed the second season's goodbye victory.
On the 24th, in a 2–2 9–2 victory over Lotte, four players who were still far from being strong showed an obsession with winning.
The first baseman, Genda, started the game by sliding his head from the safety van to the first base.
Then, in the last six games, Mori, who is at the bottom of the field with a batting rate of 18% and 2%, sent the batter and scored a deadly second base.

Mori, Yamakawa, Togasaki, and Genda, who finished 1st and 2nd in the draft in 2013, 3rd in the draft in 2014, and 3rd in the draft in 2016, are the "core 4" of Node, which the team officials call "the heart of our team today."
All of them have experience as captains in the amateur era, and their sense of responsibility is twice that of people.
Tosaki, who took over as captain from Yamakawa in his fourth year at Fuji University, said, "Mr. Yamakawa is the captain who pulls the team with words because he's good at talking anyway.On the contrary, I'm bad at speaking, so I left it to the deputy captain who is good at talking, and I was the type who stands behind."
Director Tsuji said, "Genda's safety?That's not a sign, but that's when I thought, 'I can go.'Tomoya was also a great batter, and Toosaki played well."
All four of them are currently suffering from a hit rate of 40% to 5%, but they support the team with wisdom to win even if they don't hit.

A statue of Masujiro Omura communicates his achievements as an educator to the treasurer of coinage [Yamaguchi] | Ube Daily This City Media Web
A bronze statue of Masujiro OMURA (1825-69), one of the 10 great figures of the Meiji Restoration, was found on the 23rd in the minting department of Yamaguchi City, where he was born.
An unveiling ceremony was held in the front yard of the Tsusenji Community Exchange Center, where local and government officials celebrated the completion.
Masujiro was a military scholar, Western scholar, and doctor during the late Edo period and the Meiji Restoration.
After becoming a lecturer at Bansho Shirabesho, a research and education institution for Western studies in the bakufu, he opened a private school, Hatoido, in Edo, where he taught Western studies, military science, and medicine.
After returning to the Choshu Domain, he gave lectures on military science at the Meirinkan in Yamaguchi.
The statue focused on Masujiro as an educator.
He stood beside the globe, holding a book in his hand, and gave lectures on Dutch studies.
The statue with the pedestal is about 3 meters high (1.55 meters for the statue) and is said to have been made from the point of view of a disciple who attended Masujiro's lectures.
The design was done by Marie Takami, 27, a descendant of Masujiro's wife, Kotoko, and a local designer.
In 150 years after the death of Masujiro OMURA, the executive committee of the project (chairman Toshi OKAMOTO) which was based on the Chusenji Autonomous Association, collected donations to build the castle.
Approximately 12.8 million yen of purified goods were collected from 1104 people nationwide.
The cost of the project, including the installation of the Yoshina plate, is about 12 million yen.
The remaining donations will be used to maintain and manage the statue.
President Okamoto said, "Masujiro, who has continued to have high aspirations and made great contributions as an educator, is the pride of Furusato, and a bronze statue that will be the hope of the children of the region who will take charge of the future."

There is a museum where anyone can experience art free of charge whenever they want.
There is a wide range of artists, from famous painters such as Claude Monet and Gustav Klimt to unknown artists in Japan.
Since its "opening" in April 2019, the online art museum "HASARD" has captured the hearts of users with its convenience and novelty, and has attracted even more attention by taking advantage of the new lifestyle caused by the coronal plague.
Shinnosuke Konno, a 26-year-old resident of Tokyo, who founded the site, says, "I wanted to create a service where everyone can easily enjoy art, and I wanted people to come into contact with art under difficult circumstances."
When you visit Azar, you will be surprised by the richness of the exhibition and the beauty of the images.
As of April 24, he has held a total of 14 exhibitions, including a permanent exhibition and a planned exhibition, which attract visitors not only to the color, but also to the ultra-high-resolution works that convey the texture of the brush.
Membership registration and admission fees are not required, and it is characterized by the fact that not only the viewer, but also artists who want to open a solo exhibition do not have to pay.
The way it is shown online is also attracting attention.
One of them is to move the painting.
Claude Monet's permanent exhibition "It Starts to Move Again" uses digital processing to make clouds, flowers, grasslands, and so on move.
"I want to make it possible for people who are not interested in art to get in" (Mr. Konno), so you can feel like you are in the painting.
She met the art director Konno when she was in elementary school.
When I visited the recently completed Aomori Prefectural Museum of Art with my family, I was shocked by the power of Marc Chagall's three huge paintings of "Alec".
The next day, art classes turned into a fun time, and even after going to Tokyo to study at university, I started visiting galleries and other places.
At the same time, I felt that many people do not have much opportunity to interact with art from various points of view, such as the fact that the museum is not nearby, large-scale exhibitions are held only in the metropolitan area, and it is difficult to go out for childcare.
So, while working at an IT company, I spent about two months creating a website where I could view art on the Internet.
The number of patients reached an average of 10,000 per month in the first 10 months, and increased to about 30,000 after the spread of the new colony.
When anyone wants to see, if you can appreciate art in a free form.
The aim of Azer was unintentionally accepted by more people due to the coronal plague.
Mr. Konno emphasized the significance of art appreciation for enriching one's imagination.
"When you have a lot of imagination, you can reach out to people in need.
I want art to become a better society by becoming familiar with it."
A simple reason why the era of Chinese quality is coming to an end and the era of Japanese quality (Modern Business) - Yahoo!News
The Pandemic and the Changing Values
Various predictions and discussions have been made about the post-pandemic world.
On the business side, there is a possibility that the changes described in the article of July 8, "Indeed, the work of "management" in Japan is now beginning to disappear ... ! its cruel reality ," and the article of July 4, "In the world of "After Corona," the "Japanese manufacturing industry" is actually likely to revive greatly ... ! ", etc.
[Picture] The true nature of "Japan's strength" that only Japanese people know...A surprising reality seen in Asia
From the spiritual point of view, it seems that the trend will become mainstream, such as the article on June 26, "The principle of complete combustion to be given to people who have become conscious of the end of life in the colonna" and the article on June 10, "The colonna, now full of riots, let's reconsider the effectiveness of "God's Reliance in Times of Suffering."
And it seems that the great flow of "Chinese quality to Japanese quality" will become clear to our eyes as the combination of the two "materials (economy and business)" and "spirit".
For example, it is outrageous if there are defects or defects in a T-shirt or a digital camera, but the life of the person who purchased it is no different.
On the other hand, the poor quality of masks and respirators made in China, which has recently become a topic of discussion ... ... "Chinese quality" in products that are directly linked to life and safety is fatal.
No matter how cheap you are, you can't buy such goods.
Even if you pay a considerable price, you will still want products of "Japanese quality."
Of course, this trend is not only happening in Japan.
It is also clear from the fact that Western countries, which were in a difficult situation due to a shortage of masks and medical equipment, still "returned" one after another due to the terrible "Chinese quality".
it's safer and more secure than cheap.
Products such as automobiles are also products where defects can be fatal (accidental death).
No matter how many countries, including China and South Korea, attack with the cheap selling strategy of "cheap or bad," Japanese manufacturers will not be able to hit the sword in the end, and the situation such as that described in the article on June 16, "Are the world's automobile manufacturers going to succumb to Toyota after all?"
This pandemic reminded us that many other products need to be safe and secure.
In addition, safety and security are important not only for "Japanese quality in manufacturing" but also for "Japanese quality in logistics and other services."
Like the toilet paper riots, there are cases in which intermediate distribution is delayed and cannot reach customers even though production capacity is properly maintained.
Furthermore, the article of April 17, "Who is the real culprit of the lack of masks!Do not forgive the fireplace thieves of the Chinese Communist Party regime," made me realize that self-sufficiency in Japan is also an important element of "security and safety."
It is very important for any country to be able to procure essential supplies such as masks (medical equipment) and food in their own country.
Korea's new colony infects more than 100 people for the first time in 115 days (Yonhap News) - Yahoo!News
According to Yonhap News, (SEOUL=Yonhap News) South Korea's Central Bureau of Anti-Epidemic Measures announced today that the number of people infected with the new-type coronavirus increased by 113 from 0:00 a.m. the previous day, to a total of 14,092.
The number of new infections per day exceeded 100 for the first time in 115 days since April 1.
It is believed that 32 of the 293 workers who returned from Iraq on the 24th were positively assessed, in addition to 32 crew members who were found to have been infected by a Russian vessel that entered Busan Port.
The number of new infections in South Korea ranged from 30 to 60, except for 20 days (26 cases).
Of the new infections announced on January 25, 86 were imported from overseas, the highest number since January 20, when the first infected person arrived in Korea.
The largest number of immigrants came from Iraq, with 36 from Russia, 5 from the Philippines, and 3 from the United States.
Meanwhile, 27 people were confirmed infected in the city, 11 in Seoul and Gyeonggi-do, and 5 in Busan.

The death toll remained unchanged from the previous day, at 298.
Nagoya Miyahara is the first player in J1 Soccer to be a colona-positive player after the restart of the league | Shizuoka Shimbun AtEs
Nagoya FC confirmed that Kazuya Miyahara, 24, had a positive reaction to a new type of coronavirus.
After the restart of the J. League, the player's positive reaction this time.
He is the club's third player, after FW Yumeo Kanazaki (31) and Australian goalkeeper Mitchell Langerac (31), who contracted the disease in June.
The two had already been treated and returned to the game.
This season's Miyahara entered the bench on the 22nd in the J1 Oita match at Showa Denko Dome Oita.
Nagoya held an online press conference on the 25th, revealing that it had conducted PCR tests on 60 players and staff on the same day.
98% reflection.
It turns out that white paint from Teflon-processed frying pan, heat insulation increases the cooling effect!
what a big discovery!
This year, the rainy season was marked by an unprecedented amount of precipitation, but the hot summer becomes full-fledged when it is light.
It's hot, it's hot, and even the cooling doesn't work very well.
Global warming is a major global problem, and mankind has narrowed down its wisdom on how to overcome the hot midsummer as comfortably as possible.
One way is to wear thin white clothes.
You don't have to wear black clothes to absorb heat in the summer, do you?
And applying the same principle to the architecture of houses, the number of cases using white paints is increasing.
Even if white is white, it cannot be a coating with a characteristic that reflects more light and does not absorb heat.
Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) and researchers from the Department of Applied Physics and Applied Mathematics at Columbia University have recently discovered a method for mixing white paints that can most efficiently replenish the sun's heat and improve the cooling effect of the interior of buildings.
We are aiming for early commercialization.
Until now, the white coatings with the highest reflectivity of sunlight used titanium oxide, which has a reflectivity of 85%.
White paints that already use titanium oxide are applied to roofs of buildings in high-temperature environments and are used to block out the sun's heat to increase cooling efficiency.
However, the newly discovered white coating is derived from fluorine resin of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), which is used in teflon-processed frying pans and so on.
It is a white coating that applies this teflon effect and reflects up to 98% of the sun's rays, enabling significant thermal cuts.
Even in the hot summer, thanks to the white paint using Teflon, it is surprisingly easy to spend indoors without being exposed to the intense heat.
Maybe such an era will come soon, right?
I think the roofs of Japanese houses have a lot of dark colors, but will the white system become mainstream from now on?
When is Amazon's annual big sale this year?
CNBC reported on July 21 that Amazon.com has announced it has postponed its annual large-scale sales "Prime Day".
It is held annually in July, but this year it was reportedly forced to be postponed due to the spread of a new type of coronavirus infection.
A spokesperson for Amazon said in a statement: "The details will be announced shortly."
"Prime Day has become a special celebration event that we have been looking forward to over the past five years, and this year we will be holding it at a later time than usual, while ensuring the safety of our employees and supporting our customers and exhibitors."
However, it did not specify a specific date, stating that "details will be announced shortly".
The event was held in India.
A press release was published on the country's website.
On August 6, from 0 a.m. to 48 hours, it was explained to be carried out.
Prime Day has been held all over the world at the same time, but this year may take an unusual measure.
Amazon launched this large-scale membership sale in 2015 as part of its efforts to boost sales in the summer months when sales are declining.
It was originally a 24-hour event, but has grown in scale each year, and last year it was held from 0 a.m. to 48 hours on July 15 in 18 countries including the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, India, Japan, China and Australia.
According to the company, last year's two-day sales surpassed previous sales on Black Friday (the first day of the year-end trading session) and Cyber Monday (the following Monday).
This event has also contributed to the acquisition of new subscribers for premium paid members.Last year, the number of applications on the first day was the highest in a day, and the number of the next day was the next.
Last year, the company sold 175 million items worldwide.
Internet Retailer, a specialist magazine in the online retailing industry, reported that total global sales for the two days were $71.6 billion, up 70% from the previous year.
Strict eye to mobile number transfer, excessive retention.
What about commissions and points?
Yahoo! News.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications is conducting a full-scale review of the Mobile Number Transfer System (MNP), which allows users to change their mobile phone numbers as they are.
At a meeting of experts on 21 March, he outlined his policy to revise the guidelines of the MNP, which had been established in 2004.
Specific issues include how MNP fees should be allocated and whether or not to detain transferees.
With opposition from telecommunications companies also expected, attention will be focused on whether it will lead to the promotion of healthy market competition.
All-you-can-change mobile phones are so far from the darkness of telecommunications companies In 2006, when MNP was introduced, the user fee was 2,000 yen, but now it is 3,000 yen.
The MNP fee revenues of the three major mobile telecommunications companies are estimated at 15.9 billion yen annually.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications listed the current state of MNP at the "Working Group on Verification of Competition Rules (WG)", a meeting of experts to discuss the competitive environment in the telecommunications market.
He also cited the time required for consumers to receive MNP reservation numbers when transferring to other telecommunications companies.
Most of the time, the system is available on the Internet, but due to the operation of the main system, the reception time is usually between 9 a.m. and 8 p.m.
The WG documents clearly stated that all-day response was the principle as the direction for future consideration.
It is also a problem that mobile phone companies try to retain people who want to transfer to MNP by giving them points.
It is based on the judgement that excessive retention can impede fair competition.
Mr. Shunichi Kita of Nomura Research Institute, who serves as a member of the WG, recommends that "we should have time to explain the economic benefits provided, or obtain permission from the user, and issue a number to users who do not consent to it quickly and terminate it.
However, among a series of issues, there is a structural problem concerning MNP fees: "The higher the MNP fees, the more difficult it is for customers to withdraw, so it is difficult to motivate them to actively lower them" (a person in charge of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications).
If an operator takes the lead in lowering MNP fees, there is also a concern that the outflow of customers from the company will increase and that the company's efforts will not be rewarded.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications has pointed out that many countries overseas do not charge user fees for MNP, and it is possible that this will happen in Japan as well.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications intends to summarize the results of the WG as a report around September-October, and then begin the process of revising the MNP Guidelines.
The time frame for the revision is expected to be 21 years or later.
Mobile phone companies are likely to be troublesome, including sales and customer support.

This time, I attacked strongly with a feeling ball against a strong tiger batting line.
When a straight ball ran in the second half of the 140-kilometer range, the change balls such as the count ball could also be used effectively.
In the second half of the game, he hit a left-midfielder on the first base of the Sans, but missed out on a left-handed run by Oyama and scored two runs on the second base.
In the match against Fukudome, he caught up with two balls, and the last was a fork.
He scored three tries in a row to win the match.
Katsuno finished six games with 83 balls, but at the end of the game, Yoda stepped out of the bench and announced a change of pitcher.
At the same time, Isao Nishi, who played as a pitcher, had 108 balls, but had to get off the mound first and was unable to gain the right to win the first game of the season.

Masuda-jinja Shrine in Tano, Hizen-cho, Karatsu City, located in Takakushi district, enshrines Inspector Keitaro Masuda (1869-95), who devoted himself to combating the epidemic cholera that had spread to the area 125 years ago and who died in the line of duty.
The festival has been held every year in late July, but this year it was cancelled due to the effects of a new type of coronavirus.
On the 26th, only Shinto rituals are performed by the heads of the local governments.
The annual festival was held by a local association, which held parades and fireworks displays, including a parade of Masuda policemen riding white horses.
Nearly 200 people attend each year, including bereaved families living in Kumamoto Prefecture, police officials, and local residents.
Yoshinori Takeda, 72, chairman of the local government, said that this year, media inquiries increased due to the corona disaster. "It's an annual festival that connects the community, and it's very unfortunate that it was canceled."
The prefectural police also stopped visiting the memorial festival for police school students this year.

Chief Executive Officer Sugiuchi reaffirmed that "a brave and dedicated spirit is the origin of the police force, and I want to take over as it should be."
Sergeant Masuda, who was from Kumamoto Prefecture, was assigned to Takakushi in July 1895.
It is believed that patients who are infected with cholera will be able to stay awake for a long time afterwards.
He said, "I will carry all the cholera in Takashiki with me," and died at the age of 25 on the fourth day of his arrival.

[G Osaka] Is there a possibility that 17-year-old FW Karayama will make his J1 debut against Kobe?
Japan's Miyamoto: "The scoring power is outstanding" (Sports News) - Yahoo!
G Osaka's Tsuneyasu Miyamoto, 43, spoke to reporters ahead of a four-game series against Kobe (November 26) and expressed his hopes for Shoji Karayama, 17, who joined the top team for the first time the previous week.
The commander made Karayama, who was promoted to the top flight class this season, a bench member in the match against Hiroshima on the 22nd.
I didn't give him a chance to play, but I asked the striker, who has scored three goals and scored three goals in five games so far this season in J3, "There's something outstanding about scoring.I'm 17 years old, but I want him to be more and more gum-sharp.I've seen players go overseas at a young age, but I want him to play with a high level of consciousness and desire."
Karayama scored 8 goals in 10 games last season in J3, where he played as a specially designated player.
He is 178 cm, 65 kg and slim, but he has a sense of taking the back of the D.F. with instantaneous movement, calmness to the shot before a crowded opponent's goal, etc.He boasts 11 goals in 15 games and an amazing scoring rate in J3.
In the match against Hiroshima, F.W. Ademiuson and M.F. Onose were out of the bench due to injury, and Karayama got a chance, but there was no opportunity to participate.
Miyamoto explained the condition of Ademiuson and Onose for the Kobe match, "Both of them are not 100%, but they are ambitious and challenging preparations."
If the two of them survive, the possibility of venturing into Tangshan again will come out.
In Osaka, he made his J1 debut at the age of 16 and 11 months, while FW Usami made his international debut at the age of 17 and 10 months.
Karayama, who is now 17 years and 10 months old, is expected to make his J1 debut as a follow-up to them.

In 1994, Ferrari Mondeal was stolen in the Netherlands.
The police were unable to solve the problem, but 26 years later, the mondial was miraculously discovered.
Ferrari found at the bottom of the river (four photos) The trigger for the discovery was diving training at the fire station.
On 8 July, a diver in training spotted something in the wedge shape sinking to the bottom of the river, and the police and even the Dutch army went out and pulled it up to where Ferrari Mondial was.
By matching the VIN number with the database of the stolen vehicle, the Ferrari could be linked to the 1994 incident.
The car is delivered to the insurance company, which is the legal owner, and then sent to the scrapper.
"There are still some parts left, but they're for the art of decorating," says scrapper Lowie van DE Ooyevaar, who has already received many requests from people who want to make tables out of discarded Mondials, using engine blocks and glass plates.
For the time being, we don't have any specific sales in mind, so the scrappers will keep it as an object.

As a versatile player who can protect both indoors and outdoors, he was selected by Samurai Japan and contributed the world's best at the "Premium 12" in November last year.
However, he had no experience of sayonara hitting in Seibu, and Tsuji director and Baba operations and defense and running base coach "I don't have it, you" were annoyed.
It was the second season in which he won the season-ending Goodbye.
Director Tsuji said, "Only today did I ask the Goddess of Victory for help, and she hit me well."
It is the second-largest game in the series, behind the first-season and second-season games.
This season there is only one home run, and with a batting rate of 252, Togasaki said, "We have not hit yet.We aim to win the next one, and we will do it as a team."
One of the reasons for this decision was to restart the game.

Minoru Pork Farming, which raises about 50,000 pigs annually on farms in Towada City and Rokudo Town, Japan, visited Mayor Hisashi Koyamada at Towada City Hall on May 20 to report that its farm has obtained JGAP (Japanese Agricultural and Livestock Products) certification, which indicates the safety of agricultural and livestock products.
This is the second time that a pig farmer in the prefecture has been awarded the title.

This time, JGAP certification was obtained at the 5th farm (Rokuto-cho), which breeds about 10,000 pigs from five farms and produces "locally raised pigs."
The company aimed to obtain certification because it knew that it needed certification to be selected by major buyers and that it was a condition for procurement of ingredients for use in the Tokyo Olympic Village.
Since August last year, with the support of Aomori Bank, we have been preparing with bank staff who are qualified as JGAP instructors.
On March 3 of this year, the company passed an examination by an accreditation body and met 113 criteria, including food safety.
It was certified on the same day.
The visit was attended by Toshio Nakano, President and CEO of Aomori Bank, Takeo Yamada, Director of the South Branch of Aomori Bank, and Yoshihiro Ishigo, Business Advisor of Aomori Bank's Corporate Support Department.
Mayor Oyamada said, "It's very great.(JGAP certification)I want you to do a lot of PR and expand sales channels."
Minoru Nakano, the representative, said, "I will continue to contribute to Towada City by making efforts to brand pig farming."

Heavy rain, "traffic" traces in the far north Japan National Route 152 10 km traffic stop, part of the JR Iida Line is not accessible | Shizuoka Shimbun AtEs
A line of cars waiting for the detour of the one-way alternating traffic on the 22nd afternoon, Ryuzan-cho, Tenryu Ward, Hamamatsu City (part of the photo is processed)
The Tenryu area of Hamamatsu City was also severely affected in Shizuoka Prefecture by the heavy rains in July, which caused severe damage throughout Japan, including in Kyushu.
Due to the effects of the earthquake, many parts of the city will take time to be restored, such as National Highway 152 on the main road and the JR Iida Line on the 'Living Foot'.
In addition to the inconvenience of daily life, residents are increasingly concerned about the negative impact on economic activities.
At Sejiri Bridge over the Tenryu River in Longshan Town, Longshan District, a long queue of cars waits for traffic throughout the day.
The first car stopped for nearly 40 minutes.
National Route 152 is closed for about 10 kilometers, and it is necessary to detour to the other side of the Tenryu River to get around the town.
However, the width of the road is narrow, and the entire section is alternating on one side, so the waiting time cannot be predicted.
On the 9th, a landslide occurred on the national highway in the town, and the road was closed due to the danger of rock falling on the nearby slope.
On the 13th, cracks in the autumn leaves tunnel in the restricted section were also found, and the roadway reopening time has not yet stood.
In 2018, a landslide blocked a national highway in the town, affecting residents' lives and tourism.
Mr. Kimieda Tamamoto, 76, a representative of Dragon Mama Processing Co., Ltd., a company that sells specialty products, said, "The new coronavirus has driven away the number of visitors, and the number of visitors has decreased significantly."
The JR Iida Line is inaccessible between Mizukubo Station (Mizukubo-cho, Mizukubo Ward) and Hiraoka Station (Nagano Prefecture) due to a slope collapse on the side of the line.
Shiori Ukai, 16, who used to go to Hamamatsu Hubei Kosaku-ma Branch School in Sakuma-cho, Futsu Ward from Oarashi Station in Futsu Ward, needed a one-way car transfer of about one hour.
"If it is a car, parents and myself will bear a heavy burden" and hope for early recovery.
According to JR Tokai, it is estimated that it will take about three months until the reopening, and from the 27th, it will operate a temporary train to and from Mizukubo Station-Oarashi Station in the morning and evening on weekdays.
In Mizukubo Town, landslides frequently occur on forest roads, which are also used as a livelihood road.
Sometimes it takes several hours to detour.
Keiji Kumagai, 69, president of the Mizukubo Town Forestry Association, said, "The harvesting of timber has been delayed, there are isolated islands all over the land, and I am worried about future rain."

The Portuguese newspaper ZAP reported the information based on Recordo.
Porto, who won the 2019–20 Portuguese League, held a victory ceremony on the pitch at the end of the home match on 20th of this month.

He was also absent from the championship ceremony, which led to a rumor that he would be transferred this summer.

They may already be looking for a new world.

As I was preparing for university entrance exams, the cost of school fees increased and there were many months of deficits, so I negotiated with my husband to reduce the expenses, but I was resisted.
At that time, I was told to "show me the income and expenditure" so I showed the household ledger.
Even though I should have written down all the expenses, when I looked at the household ledger, I did not have enough income to go into deficit.
My husband seemed to say "It's enough", but Ms. A thoughtlessly "I understand, I lack the power to manage the household, so please manage everything for you"If you cut the big picture, it seems that you will be returned with "Please after all".
Later, when Ms. A interviewed her husband, she said, "Although I am dissatisfied with the management of expenses, there is no time or energy to manage various outgoings of the household (e.g., school materials expenses and PTA expenses, etc.).
Husband manages the household: The case of B's daughter B's daughter, a full-time housewife, manages her daily living expenses from her husband.
Last spring, the fridge part of the refrigerator broke, so Ms. B asked her husband to buy a refrigerator.
However, my husband said, "The fridge is not good, but I can still use the refrigerator part, so it's okay."
