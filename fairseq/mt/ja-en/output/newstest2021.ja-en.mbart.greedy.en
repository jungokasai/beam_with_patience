It is a heavy semi-long with flowing forehead.
Cutting is finally starting!
First, lightly wet the whole piece to make it easier to cut.
Then, cut the top of the bee (the part above the area around the head that is the most exposed) and cut it from the bottom.
By the way, here is the point of hair that brings you closer to Minami!

After cutting the hair on the bee that I had separated, I cut it around my face.
Pull out the hair from the top of the face and cut the tip of the hair.
This allows for a stepwise movement when you lower the hairline (this is the layer cut).

Governor Yoshimura to "collaborate with Gunnavi" in Korea (Sankei Sports) - Yahoo!News
Osaka Governor Yofumi Yoshimura (45) made a remote appearance on ABC TV's Cast (Monday to Friday after 3:48 p.m.) from the prefectural government office on September 20, revealing that he is considering a partnership with the restaurant information website "gurunavi" as part of measures to prevent the spread of a new type of coronavirus infection.
Osaka Prefecture has been issuing "Declaration of Prevention of Infection Stickers" to businesses that comply with the guidelines since early this month to promote efforts to prevent the spread of infection and provide security to the people of the prefecture.
However, there are only 11,000 stores in Fushimo where stickers are issued, which is said to be more than 120,000 in restaurants alone.
Governor Yoshimura said, "I'm thinking of doing it at the end of the month, but I'll partner with "Gurunami" and make sure that I can see the tag at the reservation stage by going to a store that issues the declaration sticker when I make a reservation."
"It is not important to categorize the stores as night markets," he said, "we should clearly distinguish between those that are doing anti-infectious measures and those that are not.

The first round of the tournament was won by Seibu 0-5 Lotte.
He finished the season with a 3rd-place finish in the league, and the team finished second in the league.
The first time, Taneichi allowed the first baseman, Masakaira Suzuki, to go out on the second base, breaking the third base line, but immediately afterwards, he hit Sosuke MINADA on the third base, and Masakaira Suzuki, who aimed for the third base, also touched out on the third base.
He is also helped by his calm response to the defense of his ally, and when he manages to get through the upright pinch with zero, he will play the Seibu batting line with a combination of slider and fork centering on the straight he is proud of after two times.
He then goes up and starts to score zero points on the scoreboard.
The first round was won by the defending champions, but the second round was won by the defending champions, with the first round winners, Yusuke Motoda, and Takeshi Sugano, who finished seventh in the first round.
On this occasion, Nobunori YASUDA, the fourth, hit a right-handed strike of value 1,000 yen, finally breaking the equilibrium.
Then, he attacked third-placed player Tetsu Miyagawa in the next eight games, and scored four goals in a row, including a two-point left midfielder hit, which became the first timely after the transfer of Kei Toriya who was on the way.
He was able to push the young ace candidate from the Mariners backwards and win the game.
The team has been eliminated eight times, and has been eliminated nine times in over 100 games.
He was able to score two goals in four games, but was forced to retire in the final game of the season, when he scored his 10th career goal for the club.
I chewed on my joy with a smile.

The Tsuruoka Police Department (headed by Keizo Sato) has launched a "zero bicycle accidents" campaign in order to eliminate bicycle and motorcycle-related accidents, which are a high proportion of those occurring in the department in recent years.
In addition to promoting awareness of accident prevention with traffic safety organizations in the region, the government will also take steps to strengthen the enforcement of traffic violations of bicycles.
Three traffic fatalities occurred in the department this year, and one person who was driving a motorcycle or bicycle died.
The number of accidents is on a downward trend, but the percentage of accidents involving bicycles is about 11.7% as of June 30, and the percentage of accidents involving bicycles is about 5.8%, both of which are higher than the average for the prefecture.
In particular, the percentage of bicycle accidents in the past five years was higher than the average in the prefecture, and the plan was designed to break through this situation.
The name "Bicycle" was coined to refer to the bicycle.
The association is calling on the relevant organizations to provide driving guidance to the elderly and to use night-light reflectors in traffic safety classes.
The station issues a yellow card (instructional warning) to alert people to the dangers of the police.
The first day of the event was held at the University of California, Berkeley's Automotive School.
Approximately 30 people attended the event, and Mr. Sato said, "I would like to ask for your cooperation to reduce the number of tragic accidents in one incident."
The head of the office explained the policy and the activities of each organization.
The bicycle class will continue as the starting event of the operation.
The officers in the car demonstrated how the impacts on the bicycles differed between a collision with the brakes on and a collision without the brakes at a speed of about 55 km/h.
"I have once again realized the horror of traffic accidents, and I would like to call attention to the elderly and young people," said Koichi Kanauchi, chairman of the Tsuruoka District Regional Traffic Safety Activity Promotion Committee.

I laughed at the good talk and the delicious drinking.
The husband and wife, a 58-year-old male employee from Naka-ku, Okayama City, said with a smile, "The way we talked and the way we arranged the time were exquisite and I was immediately drawn in."
"I had a good time with the voice after a long performance," said Kisuke.
Guest rakugo actor Katsura Kodome (31) from Osaka City and the magic group Tsuyama Magic Kokokai also performed.
The old Akasaka-cho opened as the first publicly owned restaurant in 1996.
The band continued to perform at regular monthly shows and at the festivals, but they stopped performing at the end of February this year due to the effects of the new Corona.

[Moscow] A protest in the Khabarovsk region of the Far East of Russia on the 25th of April protested against the arrest and dismissal of Governor of the region.
The demonstration lasted for 15 days, and was an unusual situation.
The criticism is directed at President Putin.
The security authorities have not taken the usual measures to arrest all of the residents of the capital, Moscow, and the government's cautious attitude to the residents' feelings is starting to be taken.
The former governor of the far-right Liberal Democratic Party of the Republic of Hurghada won the gubernatorial election in 18 years by a majority of about 70% against the incumbent candidate of the ruling Putin party "United Russia".
He was one of the few non-party governors in Russia, but was detained by security authorities on 9 March.
The investigation was based on two allegations of murders of workers in the period 2004-2005.

Eleven students from the high school produced the film three days a week, starting in June, as part of the morning classes.
After molding the clay with great effort, the work is done by winding the straw to produce the red pattern of Hidasuki, which is unique to Bizen-yaki.
The process of drying and baking is completed in about two to three weeks.
A third-year student (18) said, "I'm working hard to make the new colonna so that the elderly can live in good health without losing out to the new colonna."
Bizen ware will be delivered to 40 residents of Okayama City Yurakuen, a nursing home for the elderly, where they will perform a chorus and exchange ideas.

"Thinking is not what Lucky is," Butler praises Tyler Hero, the future of Heat ( Basketball Count ) - Yahoo!News
The first game of the Heat's scrums (rehearsal game) was against the Kings.
The game was a 104–98 victory, with Duncan Robinson scoring 18 points for Team High, Tyler Hero scoring 15 and the backcourt scoring a further 15.
Not only the league's leading shooter Robinson, but also rookie and hero step-up of the 13th overall draft is an important element for Heat.
The hero missed 15 games between February and March due to an ankle injury, and ended the season with a long break on March 12, when he returned to the NHL against the Hornets.
The hero says, "I had plenty of time to get back in 100% condition, and I feel the best I've ever felt," but the performance on Scrimed was more compelling than words.
The team's lead point guard, Kendrick Nane, was delayed in joining the team, which increased the hero's playing time and made the most of his chances.
The value is great because he has 15 points after performing a different role as usual.
Team leader Jimmy Butler praised the hero of "Favorites" this time as well.
"He can be a handler, he can score, he can defend, he can do anything for the team, because he doesn't think in any position, he's watching the video, he's studying, he's figuring out where his teammates are going to be free and what he's going to do about it."
Before the start of the season, Butler liked the heroic, unruly strength of the loser and the stoic attitude he took to basketball.
That's why I invited them to start their individual practice at 4 a.m. and trained with them.
Butler once said, "He's a man who says what he thinks to everyone, and he doesn't back down, and that's a fight that I respect."
Their goal is to make sure that the team is aware of what is going on and that they are prepared to take action if they are unable to do so.
This has led to a worsening of the relationship with my teammates in the past.
Butler is probably a hero who has overlaid his youthful self.
The character of Butler, who is sometimes too harsh for his teammates, is a good guideline for those who have enough of a goat to come along.
If the two teachers' relationship with respect for each other spreads to the entire team, Heat should be a team that can move even higher.

Matsuura, two years, thanksgiving first strike
The fourth time in two years that he played in the first game of the season was in the summer.
The first time, the runner-up of the first round, Matsuura, hit a change ball in the left front.
"I wanted to win by hitting and I would retire immediately if I lost for three years."
The fourth-placed player last fall was also a big hit.
The first three years of the war were spent in the field, and the remaining two years were spent in the field.
At the meeting, Ikeda gathered the players and told Nain, "Three years together have made us the best team we've ever been in.
Four of the nine Stamens solidified their axis in two years.
It is also a sign of his commitment to serious competition.
Matsuura said, "From now on, the level of the opponent's pitcher will also rise.I intend to return the runner."
Their first goal was to score a goal in the second half, but the batter was unable to score a second goal for three years.
The number 10 is a positive response as a synergy effect, "If you get two years, you will receive three years of stimulation.
The team that aims to be the fourth strongest team for three consecutive years, including the Shizuoka tournament until last year, does not intend to make the rest of the game a memorable one.
16 musicians from Fukushima Prefecture gather to sing with locals (Fukushima Minpo) - Yahoo!News
"I want to bring the cheerful singing voice of Hama, Naka and Aizu to the world".
Sixteen musicians from Fukushima Prefecture gathered together to compose a message song.
The lyrics describe Fukushima Prefecture's struggle against the new type of coronavirus, as it moves toward recovery from the Great East Japan Earthquake and the TEPCO Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant accident.

On October 24, the song was released on YouTube.
"Pray from Fukushima".
The song is a cheerful and energetic melody that expresses the people's positive attitudes and their desire to convey the message from Fukushima.
The new colonna influenced the live houses, which became the base of music activities, and many musicians lost their places to sing and perform.
It was planned by singer-songwriter nappo (46 years old) and music group DAZU-O (37 years old) from Iwaki City, who believe in the power of music because of the invisible future.
Nappo is in charge of lyrics and composition, and Dazo is in charge of rap.
When the project started in March, singer-songwriter MANAMI (28) and Jun Sugano (38) from Fukushima City agreed one after another, and the circle expanded in an instant.
"I've had a gorgeous face-to-face encounter that I can't imagine in normal times, and I want to enjoy this opportunity to the fullest," says Nappo with a sense of immensity.
The sixteen people who had not had the opportunity to gather to prevent the infection, each recorded at a live house or at home.
In an effort to support the project, a painter from Iwaki City drew an image of the character.
It is a beautiful example of the green and blue landscape of Fukushima Prefecture.
The song was released on YouTube and is also available on CD.
Next year, the Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics will be held, which have been postponed for ten years after the earthquake.
"We have overcome many difficulties and we are very proud to be able to bring this song to many people," said Dazo.
The other musicians are as follows.

However, it is difficult for a person to keep a watch on the information that is overflowing and extract useful information from it.
Specti is able to detect information about natural disasters and accidents from social media such as Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook, analyze the content, determine the truthfulness of the information, and distribute it to the companies using it.
"We broadly consider "crisis" to be a situation that has a negative impact that can stop or stagnate social activities" (Murakami Kenjiro, CEO), a crisis management support service that visualizes various crises occurring in Japan and overseas.
The NHK broadcaster during the Kumamoto earthquake in April 2016 was the first major use of Specti, and subsequently, the movement of adoption spread rapidly among companies.
It is said that not only television stations and newspapers, but also companies that support social infrastructure such as electricity, gas, and transportation, and more than 350 companies in Japan, including local governments throughout the country, are currently using Specti.
Analyze the post to determine the type of "crisis" and the place where it occurred
Specti delivers information in four steps: "Collection of information", "Analysis and content classification", "Title assignment", and "Truth and falsehood assessment".
The company that uses the information must specify the region where it will collect the information (prefecture, city, town, etc.) and the category of crisis (disaster or accident, etc.) in advance.
Specti collects posts that fall under its designation using an API provided by social media.
Next, the collected posts are analyzed and categorized into text, images, and videos.
For example, if a video shows a fire engine, black smoke rising from a building, and orange flames from a room, then it is classified as a "fire".
In addition, images of vehicles that have been rolled over are classified as "traffic accidents" and images of roads covered with water are classified as "road floods".
Specti also estimates the location of disasters and accidents.
"We often don't know where to find the post, so we're combining various information to make an estimate," says Murakami.
For example, if a road sign or signboard is projected onto an image or video, the information about the place name is extracted from it and matched with the place name database to identify the place.

It is a Chiba people near Tokyo.
I have lived in the same prefecture for about 30 years since I was born.
The word "smuggle" which means "to go sideways" was used in conversations with friends at a university (Tokyo) and was instantly kiyoton.
The flow and the sense of the word made me understand the meaning, but people in Tokyo and Saitama prefectures said they would not use it.

"Japanese 'cool Chinese' is not Chinese Uke ... ?
"Cold noodle dishes" unpopular wake (Modern Business) - Yahoo!News
In China, cold Chinese noodles are called 'Japanese cold noodles.'
As mentioned at the beginning, cold Chinese is a Chinese dish (Japanese Chinese) originating in Japan, which was invented based on Chinese "ryangbangmyen (cold mixed noodles)".
Therefore, although it does not exist in China originally, it has become more common in Japanese restaurants in summer due to the diversification of food.
Recently, Japanese convenience stores have also introduced a range of products called "Japanese Soba Ryomen/Soba Cold-Dried Chinese" and "Kawako Chicken Silk Ryomen/Sichuan-style Chicken Cold-Dried Chinese".
On the other hand, Japanese-style Chinese cuisine is not popular in China on the whole, as it is dominated by popular punch-effect Chinese cuisine such as Sichuan and Hunan cuisine.
Of course, Japanese-Chinese flavoring is often familiar to Chinese people.
Therefore, it is not tasty, but it tends to be criticized as having little impact.
"Cold Chinese" is no exception, and is still a minor presence in China.
Incidentally, the name of cold Chinese noodles in China is "Japanese cold noodles".
It is recognized by Chinese as one of the Japanese dishes.
the summer's standard is ryangpi.
In China, the noodle dish that feels summer is "Liang Pei."
In Japan, many people are not familiar with it, but Liangpi is a flat noodle made from flour, rice flour, starch, etc. originated in Shaanxi Province.
It is said that it has a history of more than 2000 years.
It is a staple of B-class gourmet food sold at stalls, and the price is very reasonable around 10 to 20 yuan (150 to 300 yen).
It has the character '涼' (literally, cool), but it is not made with ice like Japanese cold Chinese.
The temperature is normal.
Add the ingredients of your choice, such as chopped cucumber, carrots, boiled peanuts, and spices such as parsley, pepper, ginger, and garlic to the noodles.
Finally, the mixture of soy sauce, soy sauce, vinegar, sesame paste and peanut paste is added to the mixture and the mixture is finished with a special seasoning.
The noodles are well-drained, and the sour and rich spicy sauce is well-intertwined with the noodles, and they are very refreshing even when you have no appetite for summer butter.
In addition, because it is permeated throughout China, there are various toppings and flavorings, and the rich variety is also a characteristic of cool skin, and it is one of the ways to enjoy.

Cool water shower benefits body and mind (Cosmopolitan) - Yahoo!
and it suppresses inflammation, muscle pain, etc.
A study published in The North American Journal of Medical Sciences investigating the effectiveness of hydrotherapy (a water-based treatment) has found that it can be expected to have both physical and mental healing effects.
By taking cold water after exercise, it is said that muscle pain and other inflammatory effects can be suppressed.
"It's important to exercise and take a cold shower as much as possible," says Douglas Cassa, head of the Korey Stringer Institute for Sports Medicine and professor at the University of Connecticut.
it reduces fatigue.
When you exercise in high temperatures, your heart, muscles and skin need more blood flow than usual.
"When you exercise, your heart rate increases, which increases blood flow to your heart, and your muscles contract, which increases blood flow to your muscles," says Professor Casa.
"The cold water shower lowers the skin's temperature, which reduces the blood flow to the skin, but instead allows blood to flow to the internal organs such as the stomach and intestines, making it easier for the body to absorb moisture and nutrients after exercise, which in turn reduces the fatigue felt after exercise."
Hope for the Hormissis Effect
Dr. Drosefsky also explains that by bathing in cold water, the "hormicity effect" can be expected to be activated.
The holistic effect is the idea that there should be little or no harmful substances or stresses in the body.
"Low-oxygen exercise, a little fasting and cold showers are examples of the holistic effects that can be expected for health.By taking cold showers, hormones and neurotransmitters are stimulated, and physical and physical strength and recovery can be enhanced."

Macau Casino Supervisory Authority to inspect the implementation of anti-epidemic measures at the casino facilities...Presentation of a new coronavirus negative certificate at the time of admission is mandatory (Macao Newspaper) - Yahoo!News
About 40 casinos in Macau were closed for 15 days from February 5 to 19 due to the outbreak of the new-type colonavirus (COVID-19), and have been reopened after 20 February, with strict anti-epidemic measures in place.
The Macau Casino Regulatory Authority (DICJ) requires the operators to protect the health of employees and guests to the maximum extent possible when reopening, and to ensure the distance between gaming (casino) tables, to accommodate the opening of adjacent seats in table games (for example, Baccarat tables can seat three to four people at the same time), and to operate slot machines once or twice, in order to reduce the risk of cross-infection.
Disinfection of gaming equipment such as chips is also being strengthened.
Guests are also required to wear a mask, temperature monitor, and a valid health code (including recent residence, contact history with new colonists, symptoms such as fever and cough, and contact information generated by entering the code) upon entry.
From 0 a.m. on July 15, the condition was also added to present a negative certificate of the new colonavirus nucleic acid test (limited to those issued by authorized facilities in Macao or Guangdong province for the validity period).
The new requirement to present a negative certificate was introduced in response to the relaxation of the waterfront measures between Macao and Guangdong Province (with the abolition of quarantine quarantine for 14 days, subject to conditions) from 6 a.m. on 15th, which will be a preventive measure.
DICJ announced on July 18 that following the change in admission conditions from July 15, Director General Adriano Ho and others visited the casino facilities to see the implementation of anti-epidemic measures, and held a meeting with the security department representatives of six casino operators to reiterate their request to protect the health of employees and guests by thoroughly managing the admission of guests.
The DICJ has indicated that it will continue to conduct strict patrols of casino facilities, hold regular meetings with the operators in accordance with the situation and evaluation, and coordinate anti-epidemic measures at the casinos as appropriate in accordance with the guidelines of the Government Health Bureau.
The visit to the casino facility was also accompanied by director Lin Matsu and others from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention of the Health Bureau, and they were instructed on the site on disinfecting gaming chips and how to take a safe distance between the seats of electronic casino equipment.
Due to the sharp decline in inbound passengers due to anti-epidemic measures including entry restrictions, casino sales from January to June this year totaled 337.20 billion Macao pataca (Japanese Yen equivalent: about 451.9 billion yen), a 77.4% decrease from the same period of the previous year.

The Yuwaku Onsen Bonbori Festival, an annual event that was canceled due to the effects of the new-type coronavirus, will begin on August 1, with a bonbori message written to healthcare workers.
The city of Yu is wrapped in the light of the ale, and visitors are treated with healing.
The Bonbori Festival is an event that recreates the festival that appears in the anime "Hanasaki Kuroha" based on Yuwaku Onsen, and is organized by the Yuwaku Onsen Tourism Association.
The festival started in 2011 when anime was broadcast, and every year, many anime fans from all over the country come to visit.
Every year, from the lighting ceremony in July to the main festival in October, a lantern is lit on the stairs leading to Yuwaku Inari Shrine next to Soyu.
This year, the festival was forced to be cancelled due to the new corona, but local and national fans said "I miss the lack of fog in Yuwaku's summer" one after another, and the association devised this project.
The company has launched a recovery campaign to help the world heal and recover from the effects of the colonnade.
So far, about 50 students from Yuwaku and Shibahara have written messages with illustrations, and more than 100 applications have been received from all over Japan.
The message paper is purchased from the association's homepage, filled in, and sent to the association in a reply envelope, where you can receive a photo with a light attached to a bubble.
The total cost of the project is 6,000 yen per set, and the project will be open to all applicants until the total number of bonbori reaches 350.
The lights are scheduled to be on by the end of November.
Shinichiro Yamashita, 48, who has been the festival's executive committee chairman since the first festival, said, "Reading the message encourages us, too, and we want to hold the festival, which will be the 10th milestone, in a grand way next year."
For the campaign, we also prepared a drawing of the character of Hanasaki Kurohara and the bridge of the Asanogawa River.
From the first day, the clear file with illustrations will be given to the users of the special accommodation plan at Yuwaku Onsen.

Hero Tozaki said, "I was also in the bench and I thought I had to do something, and I felt that Tomoya was also trusting me behind the bench and connecting me.Yamakawa said, 'Be active!' before going to the first base with respect, so I could feel it."
Four of the players in the draft, Mori, Yamakawa, Togasaki, and Genda, ranked 1st and 2nd in 2013, 3rd in 14, and 3rd in 16, are the "core 4" of Node, which the team officials call "the heart of our team today."
Both have experience as captains in amateur times and a sense of responsibility is twice as great as that of a person.
"Yamakawa is a good communicator, so he's the one who pulls the team with words," says Tosaki, who took over as captain from Yamakawa in his fourth year at Fuji University. "On the other hand, I'm a bad speaker, so I left the communicating to the deputy captain, who is the type who stands behind me."
"Genda's safety?That's not a sign, but I thought it was 'OK, I can go'.Tomoya was a great batter, and Toosaki hit me well," said director Tsuji, "The spirit of Moriyama Togen."
The team is currently struggling with a batting rate of 40 to 50 percent, but they are supporting the team with wisdom to win even if they don't hit.

Statue of Masujiro Omura Speaks to the Mint Manager about his Achievements as an Educator | Ube Daily News This City Media Web
A bronze statue of Masujiro OMURA (1825-69), one of the 10 great leaders of the Meiji Restoration, was seen on the 23rd at the minting office of Yamaguchi City, where he was born.
The ceremony was held in front of the Tsusenji Community Exchange Center, and local and government officials celebrated the completion.
Masujiro was a military scholar, Western scholar, and doctor during the late Edo period and the Meiji Restoration.
After he became a lecturer at Bansho Shirabesho, a research and education institution of Western studies in the bakufu, he opened a private school, Hatoido, in Edo, and taught Western studies, military science, and medicine.
After returning to Choshu Domain, he lectured on military science at the Meirinkan in Yamaguchi.
The statue focused on Masujiro as an educator.
He stood by the globe, holding a book in his hand, and gave lectures on Dutch studies.
The statue with the pedestal is about 3 meters high (1.55 meters for the statue) and was made from the viewpoint of a disciple who was taking Masujiro's lecture.
The design was done by Marie Takami, 27, a descendant of Masujiro's wife, Kotoko, and a local designer.
The project was established 150 years after Masujiro OMURA's death, and was funded by donations from the Executive Committee (chairman Toshi OKAMOTO).
Approximately 2.8 million yen of purified goods were collected from 1,004 people nationwide.
The cost of the project, including the installation of the Yoshino board, is approximately 12 million yen.
The remaining donations are used for the maintenance of the statue.
"Masujiro, who has continued to be ambitious and made great contributions as an educator, is a proud of Furusato," said President Okamoto.

"Hasard" Online Art Museum Launched by Konno (Hachinohe) - Yahoo!News
There is a museum where anyone can touch art free of charge whenever they want.
The collection includes works by famous painters such as Claude Monet and Gustave Climt, as well as by unknown artists in Japan.
Since its opening in April 2019, the online museum HASARD has captured the hearts of users with its convenience and novelty, and has attracted even more attention as a new lifestyle due to the effects of the coronal plague.
"I wanted to create a service that everyone could easily enjoy art," says Shinnosuke Konno, 26, a Tokyo resident who founded the site in Hachinohe City.
When you visit Azar, you will be surprised by the richness of the exhibition and the beauty of the images.
As of today, the museum has held 14 permanent and planned exhibitions, and the works are not only colorful but also extremely high-resolution, transmitting the texture of the brush.
It is characterized by the fact that membership registration and admission fees are not required, and not only the viewer, but also artists who want to open a solo exhibition do not have to pay.
The unique online presentation also attracts attention.
One of them is moving the painting.
In Claude Monet's permanent exhibition, "It's Starting to Move Again," he digitally processes clouds, flowers, grasslands, and other objects to make them move.
"I want to make it possible for people who are not interested in art to enter" (Konno, representative) and you can feel like you are in the painting.
The first meeting between the artist and the representative of Konno was when he was in elementary school.
When I visited the recently completed Aomori Prefectural Museum of Art with my family, I was shocked by the power of Marc Chagall's three huge paintings of "Alec".
The next day, art classes turned into fun time, and after I got to Tokyo to go to university, I started visiting galleries and other places.
At the same time, I felt that many people do not have much opportunity to interact with art from various perspectives, such as the fact that the museum is not nearby, large-scale exhibitions are held only in the metropolitan area, and it is difficult to go out for childcare.
So, while working for an IT company, I spent about two months creating a website where I could view art on the Internet.
The number of patients reached an average of 10,000 per month in the first 10 months, and after the spread of the new colony, it increased to about 30,000.
If anyone can see art in a free form when they want to.
Their goal was to make the colony more popular.
Mr. Konno emphasized that the significance of art appreciation enriches the imagination.
"When you have a lot of imagination, you can reach out to people in need.
I hope that art will become more accessible and that we will become a better society."

Various predictions and discussions are being made about the post-pandemic world.
On the business side, there is a possibility that changes will occur as described in the article on July 8, "The work of "management" is actually beginning to disappear in Japan ... ! its cruel reality ," and the article on July 4, "In the world of "After Corona," the "Japanese manufacturing industry" is actually likely to revive greatly ... ! "

In the spiritual aspect, the trends of June 26th article "The principle of complete burning" to give to people who became conscious of the end of life in the colonna" and June 10th article "The colonna, now full of riots, let's reconsider the effectiveness of "God's Reliance in Times of Suffering" seem to be mainstream.
And it seems that the big flow of "China quality to Japan quality" will become clear to our eyes as the form of the combination of the two "materials (economy and business)" and "spirit".
For example, it is annoying to have defects or defects in a T-shirt or a digital camera, but there is no other way to the life of the person who purchased it.
In contrast, the poor quality of masks and respirators made in China, which has been a topic of discussion recently, is fatal.
No matter how cheap they are, they cannot be purchased.
Even if you pay a considerable price, you will still want products of "Japanese quality."
Of course, this trend is not only happening in Japan.
It is also clear that the European and American countries, which had difficulties due to a lack of masks and medical equipment, returned one after another because of the terrible quality of "China."
it's safer than cheap.
In addition, the defective products such as automobiles can be fatal (accidental death).
No matter how much China and South Korea and other countries attack with their cheap selling strategies of "cheap or bad," Japanese manufacturers cannot win the battle in the end.The reason why the situation that I mentioned in the article "Are the world's car manufacturers going to fall for Toyota?" on June 16 is that the Japanese quality is strongly demanded for automobile products.
The pandemic reminded us that many other products need to be safe and secure.
Safety and security are important not only for "Japanese quality in manufacturing" but also for "Japanese quality in logistics and other services."
Like the toilet paper scandal, there are cases where intermediate distribution is delayed and not available to the customer even though the production capacity is properly maintained.
Furthermore, as in the article "Who is the real culprit of the mask shortage!Do not forgive the fireplace thieves of the Chinese Communist Party regime" of April 17, I strongly felt that self-sufficiency in Japan is also an important element of "security and safety".
It is very important that any country should be able to procure essentials such as masks (medical equipment) and food in their own country.

Nagoya Miyahara to be the first player to be a Colona-positive J1 football player after the restart of the league | Shizuoka Shimbun AtEs
The Japan Football League (J1)'s Nagoya FC announced on May 25 that it has confirmed that Kazuya Miyahara (24) has a positive reaction to the new type of coronavirus.
After the J. League restart, the player's positive reaction this time.
The club's players are the third to be infected, following FW Yumeo Kanazaki (31) and Australian goalkeeper Mitchell Langerac (31).
Both were already treated and returned to the game.

98% reflection.
It turns out that white paint from the Teflon processing frying pan, heat insulation will increase the cooling effect!
no way!
This year, the rainy season was marked by an unusual amount of precipitation, but the hot summer becomes more serious when it is bright.
It's hot and hot, and even the cooling gets so bad that it's like you're just imagining it and you're just going to die, right?
Global warming is a major global problem, and mankind has been refining its wisdom on how to overcome the hot summer in a comfortable way.
One way is to wear thin white clothes.
You don't have to wear black clothes to absorb heat in the summer, do you?
And applying the same principle to the architecture of houses, it seems that there are more and more cases of using white paint.
The latest research field was whether white could be a coating with a characteristic that reflected more light and did not absorb heat, even if it was white.
Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science at UCLA, in collaboration with researchers from the University of Columbia's Department of Applied Physics and Applied Mathematics, has recently discovered a method for mixing white paints that can most efficiently recycle solar heat to improve the cooling effect of the interior of buildings.
The goal is to make it practical at an early stage.
Until now, the white coatings with the highest reflectivity of sunlight were those using titanium oxide, which achieved 85% reflectivity.
White paints that already use titanium oxide are applied to roofs in high-temperature buildings and other environments, and are used to block out the sun's heat and improve cooling efficiency.
However, what was newly discovered was a white coating that was derived from a fluorine resin of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), which is used in the teflon-processed frying pan and so on.
The white coating that applies this teflon effect reflects nearly 98% of the sun's rays, allowing for significant heat cuts.
Even in hot summer, thanks to the white paint that Teflon uses, the interior is easy to spend without being exposed to the intense heat.
Maybe such an era will come soon, right?
I think that Japanese house roofs are often dark colors, but will white be the mainstream from now on?
When is Amazon's annual big sale this year?
Amazon.com announced on July 21 that it had postponed its annual large-scale sales "Prime Day".
The event is held every July, but this year it was reportedly forced to be postponed due to the spread of a new type of colonavirus infection.
"Details to be announced soon" Amazon's spokesman said in a statement.
"Prime Day has become a special celebration event that we look forward to over the next five years, and this year we will be holding it at a later time than usual, while ensuring the safety of our employees and supporting our customers and exhibitors."
However, the date of the event was not specified, only stating that "details will be announced soon".
The event was held in India.
The press release is posted on the website of the country.
It was broadcast on August 6, 2008 from 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m.
Prime Day has been held simultaneously around the world, but this year may take an unusual measure.
Amazon launched this large-scale membership sale in 2015 as part of its efforts to boost sales in the summer months when sales are declining.
The event was originally a 24-hour event, but has grown in scale each year, and last year it was held from 0 a.m. to 48 hours on July 15 in 18 countries including the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, India, Japan, China and Australia.
According to the company, last year, sales for two days were higher than those for Black Friday (the first day of the year-end trading session) and Cyber Monday (the following Monday).
The event also helped to attract new premium members, with the number of first-day applications reaching a record high last year, and the number of the next day following.
Last year, the company sold 175 million items worldwide.
The online retailer Internet Retailer reported that the two-day global sales totaled $71.6 billion, up 70% from the previous year.
Mobile phone number transfer, strict eyes on excessive retention.
What about commissions and points?
(News) Yahoo!
The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications is conducting a full-scale review of the Mobile Number Transfer System (MNP), which allows users to change their mobile phone numbers as they are.
At the meeting of experts on 21 March, the government announced its policy to revise the guidelines for the MNP, which was established in 2004.
The specific issues are diverse, such as the way MNP fees are paid and whether to detain transferees.
With the expected reaction from the telecommunications companies, attention will be focused on whether it will lead to the promotion of healthy market competition.
The dark side of communication companies where unlimited mobile phone transfers are so far away The user fee for the initial introduction of MNP in 2006 was 2,000 yen, but now it is 3,000 yen.
The MNP fee revenue of the three major mobile communications companies is estimated at 15.9 billion yen annually.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications (MIC) on March 21 listed the current situation regarding MNP at the "Working Group on Verification of Competition Rules" (WG) meeting of experts to discuss the competitive environment in the telecommunications market.
The time required for consumers to receive the MNP reservation number when transferring to other telecommunications companies was also highlighted.
The main entrance to the station is from the station building, but due to the high traffic, the station is open from 9 a.m. to 8 p.m.
The WG documents clearly stated that the principle of all-day response was the direction for future consideration.
The company also sees problems in retaining people who wish to transfer to MNP by giving them points from mobile phone companies.
This is because the judgement that excessive retention can impede fair competition.
"We need to have time to explain the economic benefits, get permission from the users, and issue a number to the users who do not agree to it," says Shunichi Kita, a partner at Nomura Research Institute who is a member of the WG.
However, among the issues raised, there is a structural problem with MNP fees, namely, "The higher the MNP fees, the less customers can be outsourced, so it is difficult to motivate customers to lower them aggressively" (a person in charge of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications).
If a company takes the lead in lowering MNP fees, it is also concerned that the company's efforts will not be rewarded, as customers will be more likely to leave the company.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications also points out that many countries overseas do not require user fees for MNP, and this may be the case in Japan.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications plans to compile the results of the WG as a report in September or October, and then begin the procedure for revising the MNP guidelines.
The time frame for the revision is expected to be 21 years or later.
Mobile phone companies are likely to be troubled by the way they sell and customer support.

Eye Diseases in Life Health Relaxation Seminar Hiramatsu Hospital Director of Ophthalmology Kinoshita|Local Topics|Saga Shimbun News|Saga Shimbun LIVE
Akira Kinoshita, Director of Ophthalmology at Hiramatsu Hospital, explained about dry eye, etc.
"Hot seminar" with Dr. Akio Kinoshita, Director of Ophthalmology, Hiramatsu Hospital explaining dry eye and other topics.
A "Health Comfort Seminar" (sponsored by Saga Shimbun and co-sponsored by Yonezawa Glasses) was held on the 25th at the Yonezawa Saga Main Store in Shimoda-cho, Saga City.
Akio Kinoshita, head of ophthalmology at Hiramatsu Hospital (Kojo), explained about eye diseases that are deeply involved in life, such as dry eyes and cataract.
Dry eye is called "tear disease" and is explained as a disease where the quality of tears is broken and the tears cannot evenly pass through the surface of the eye.
"Contact lens users are about four times more likely to be affected," said Kinoshita, adding that "you should not use them for long periods of time or sleep while wearing them."
The students showed measures such as placing the computer screen below the height of the eyes and humidifying the room with air conditioning.
He also introduced ingredients and foods that are effective for dry eyes.
"Omega 3, which is contained in blue fish, prevents the evaporation of tears, and mucin, which is abundant in natto and okura, improves the quality of tears."
In the case of cataract surgery, I touched upon the differences in the way of vision between monofocal and multifocal lenses inserted into the eye instead of the crystal.
About 40 people attended the seminar.
As a measure to prevent new-type coronavirus infection, the event was held in two parts, morning and afternoon, with a small number of people, and temperature testing, disinfection, and adequate ventilation of the venue were carried out before the entrance.

[G Osaka] What is the possibility of a 17-year-old FW Karayama making his J1 debut in a Kobe match?
"They're going to be a big hit," says Miyamoto (Sports News) - Yahoo!
G Osaka's Tsuneyasu Miyamoto, 43, spoke to reporters ahead of the four-game series against Kobe (November 26 at Noesta) and expressed his expectations for the third-year high school FW Shoji Karayama, 17, who joined the top team for the first time the previous week.
The commander has promoted Karayama to the top flight class this season and made him a bench member in the 22nd match against Hiroshima.
He did not give him a chance to play, but he told the striker, who has scored three goals and scored three goals in five games in the J3 this season, "There is a striking part to the point-taking, I'm 17 years old, but I want you to do more and more game-sharing.I've seen players go abroad as young as I have, but I want you to play with a high level of awareness and a high level of desire."
Karayama scored 8 goals in 10 games in the J3, where he was a specially selected player last season.
He is 178 cm tall and 65 kg, but he has a sense of taking the back of the D.F. with a quick movement, calmness to the shot before the crowded opponent's goal, etc.
In the match against Hiroshima, F.W. Ademiuson and M.F. Onose were out of the bench due to injury, and Karayama got a chance, but he did not have a chance to play.
Miyamoto explained the condition of Ademiuson and Onose for the Kobe match, "Both are not 100%, but they are challenging preparation with high ambition."
If the two of them survive, the possibility of venturing into Tangshan again will come out.

Karayama, who is now 17 years and 10 months old and is expected to be the next talent, is also expected to make his J1 debut as a follow-up to them.
Ferrari stolen 26 years ago found at the bottom of the river: No restoration (octane.jp) - Yahoo!News
In 1994, Ferrari Mondeal was stolen in the Netherlands.
The police were unable to solve the problem, but 26 years later, the mondial was miraculously discovered.
Ferrari found at the bottom of the river (Photo 4) The trigger for the discovery was diving training at the fire station.
On 8 July, a diver in training spotted something in the wage shape that sank to the bottom of the river, and the police and even the Dutch army moved in to pick up the thing, which was Ferrari Mondial.
By matching the VIN number with the database of the stolen vehicle, the Ferrari was linked to the 1994 incident.
The car is then delivered to the insurance company, which is the legal owner, and then sent to the scrapper.
"There are still some parts left, but they are for the art of decorating," says scrapper Lowie van DE Ooyevaar, "and we've already received many requests from people who want to make tables out of discarded Mondials, using engine blocks and glass plates."
For the time being, we have no plans to sell it, and the scrapper will keep it as an object.

He was called "The Man Who Didn't Have".
He was selected as a Samurai Japan player who can protect both inside and outside the field, and he contributed the world's best at the "Premium 12" in November last year.
However, he did not have any experience in the Seibu, and Tsuji director and Baba operations and defense and running base coach were annoyed with "you don't have it," he said.
Their performances were a disappointment and they won the second season of the season.

Japan's Minoru Pig Farms Acquire JGAP (Daley Tohoku Shimbun) - Yahoo!News
Minoru Pork Farming, which raises about 50,000 pigs annually on farms in Towada City and Rokudo Town, Japan, visited Towada City Hall on May 20 to report that its farm has obtained the JGAP (Japanese Agricultural and Livestock Products) certification, which indicates the safety of agricultural and livestock products.
It is the second such project in the province.
The company produces garlic pork, which uses a powder of garlic from the prefecture, and rice, which uses locally grown pork.
This time, the 5th farm (Rokuto-cho), which breeds about 10,000 pigs and produces "locally raised pigs" from five farms, has obtained JGAP certification.
The company aimed to obtain certification because it knew that it needed certification to be selected by major buyers and that it was a condition for procurement of ingredients used in the Tokyo Olympic Village.
Since August last year, the Bank of Aomori has been supporting the project, and we have been preparing with bank staff who are qualified as JGAP instructors.
On March 3, 2018, the company passed the certification process of the certification organization and met 113 criteria including food safety.
It was certified on 13 December.
The visit was attended by Toshio Nakano, the company's representative, and Dai Nakano, the company's managing director, as well as Keno Yamada, the Aomori Bank's South Branch Manager and Yoshihiro Ishigo, the bank's business advisor in the Corporate Support Department.
Mayor Oyamada expressed his wish that the company would promote the JGAP certification and expand sales channels.
Minoru Nakano, the representative of the company, said, "I will continue to make efforts to promote the brand of pig farming and contribute to Towada City."
"We aim to obtain certification for the remaining four farms," said Watanabe Nakano, executive director of the university.

Heavy rains, "traffic" in the far north, "nails" National Route 152 10 km traffic stop, JR Iida Line partial section not accessible | Shizuoka Shimbun AtEs
The line of cars waiting for the detour of the one-way alternating traffic is stopped by the entire National Highway 152.(Part of the photo is processed)
The heavy rains in July caused tremendous damage throughout Japan, including in Kyushu.The damage was also felt in the Tenryu area of Hamamatsu City, Shizuoka Prefecture.
The effects of the earthquake and sandstorms on the main road, National Route 152, and the JR Iida Line, which is the "foot of life," have left many places that require time to be restored.
Residents are increasingly concerned about the inconvenience of daily life and the negative impact on economic activities.
At Sejiri Bridge, which overlooks the Tenryu River in Longshan Town, Longshan District, a long line of cars wait for traffic all day long.
The first car stopped for nearly 40 minutes.
The route is approximately 15 miles (1.6 km) long and requires a detour to the southern end of the town.
However, the road is narrow, and all sections are alternating on one side, so waiting time is not predictable.
On the 9th, a landslide occurred on the national road in the town, and the road was closed due to the danger of rock falling on the nearby slope.
On the 13th, cracks in the autumn leaves tunnel in the regulated section were also found, and the roadway reopening time has not yet stood.
In 2018, the city was hit by landslides that blocked the national highway, affecting residents' lives and tourism.
"The new coronavirus is driving the crowd away," says Kimieda Tamamoto, 76, a representative of Dragon Mama, a specialty-selling factory.
The JR Iida Line was in a state of disrepair between Mizukubo Station (Mizukubo-cho, the same ward) and Hiragaoka Station (Nagano Prefecture) due to a slope collapse along the side of the line.
Shiori Ukai (16), who was traveling from Oarashi Station (the same town) in Futsu Ward to the Hamamatsu-Koshu-Takasakuma Branch School in Sakuma-cho, Sakuma Ward, needed a one-way car transfer of about one hour.
"If it is a car, parents and myself will bear a heavy burden" and hope for early recovery.
According to JR Tokai, it is expected to take about three months until the reopening, and from the 27th, it will operate a special train that runs between Mizukubo Station and Oarashi Station in the morning and evening on weekdays.
In Mizukubo Town, landslides frequently occur on forest roads that are also used as a livelihood road.
It can take several hours to detour.
"The harvesting of the trees is also stalled," says Keiji Kumagai, 69, president of the Mizukubo Town Forestry Association.

Ms. A is in charge of the household.
I had to negotiate with my husband to reduce my expenses, but he resisted.
At that time, I was told to show them the income and expenses, so I showed them the household ledgers.
I should have listed all expenses, but when I looked at the household ledger, it wasn't enough to make a deficit.
My husband seemed to lean on me saying "It's enough", but A-ko thoughtlessly "I understand, I am insufficient in household management, please you should manage everything"If you cut the big picture, "I'm sure you will be asked back."
Later, when Ako interviewed her husband, she said, "I am not satisfied with the way the expenses are managed, but I have no time or energy to manage various outgoings and incomes of the household (e.g. school materials expenses and PTA expenses, etc.)."
Husband manages the household: Case of B-child B-child, a full-time housewife, is living on a daily basis with her husband's money.
Last spring, the fridge part of the refrigerator broke, so Ms. B asked her husband to buy a refrigerator.
However, my husband said, "The freezer is not good, but the refrigerator part is still usable, so it's okay."
However, in the summer, it seems that the husband himself wanted to prepare an environment where he can eat ice cream at any time,"Refrigerator, I will buy it after all"He said that hand-written turns.

R Madrid has already received offers from about 30 clubs, but they are planning to train wrestlers in domestic clubs.
The Spanish newspaper Marca reported that Kubo's transfer was being made to Real Sociedad, as well as to Villarreal, Granada, Hetafe and Betis, and that "Five clubs are interested in winning Kubo, but Real Madrid want a club above the mid-tier".
