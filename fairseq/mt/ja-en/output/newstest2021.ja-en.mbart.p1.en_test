The Tsuruoka Police Department (headed by Kagezo Sato) has launched "Operation Zero by-by Accidents" in order to eliminate accidents involving bicycles and motorcycles, which account for a high proportion of accidents occurring within the department in recent years.
In addition to promoting awareness of accident prevention together with traffic safety organizations within the jurisdiction, it will embark on strengthening enforcement of violations of traffic rules for bicycles.
This year, three traffic fatalities occurred in the department, and a person who was driving a motorcycle or bicycle died.
Although the number of accidents is on a decreasing trend, the percentage of accidents involving bicycles is about 11.7% as of June 30, and the percentage of accidents involving bicycles is about 5.8%, both of which are higher than the average for the prefecture.
In particular, the percentage of bicycle accidents that occurred in the past five years was often higher than the average for the prefecture, and he planned a strategy to overcome this situation.
The term "bicycle" was coined to refer to a bicycle.
More than ever, relevant organizations will be called upon to provide driving guidance to the elderly and to use night-light reflectors in traffic safety classrooms.
In this case, a yellow card (instructional warning card) is issued to alert the police.
The opening ceremony of the operation was held at the Shoko Gakuen Automobile Training Center in Tsuruoka City on October 21.
Approximately 30 people attended the event, and Mr. Sato said, "I would like to ask for your cooperation in reducing even one tragic accident."
The head of the department explained the policies and activities of each organization.
As a starting event for the operation, a bicycle class was held.
They demonstrated how different the impacts on the bicycles were when the policeman in the car hit the bicycle with the brake on and when the policeman hit the bicycle without stepping on the brake at a speed of about 55 km/h.
Koichi Kanauchi, Chairman of the Tsuruoka District Regional Traffic Safety Activity Promotion Committee, said, "I have once again realized the horror of traffic accidents, and I would like to call attention not only to the elderly, but also to young people."

"Thinking isn't Lukey's," Butler once again praises Tyler, the hero of the future of Heat ( Basketball Count ) - Yahoo!News
Photo=Getty Images Heat's first practice match was against the Kings.
In the 104–98 victory, Duncan Robinson scored 18 points for Team High, followed by Tyler Hero with 15 points and a back-court touchdown.
Robinson, the league's leading shooter, as well as rookie and hero step-up of the 13th overall draft is an important element for Heat.
He missed fifteen games between February and March due to an ankle injury, and ended the season with a long suspension at the end of the season against the Hornets on March 12.
The hero says, "I had plenty of time, so I was able to get back in 100% condition, which is the best feeling I've ever felt," but the performance on the scrampage was more convincing than words.
The team's starting point guard, Kendrick Nunn, was delayed in joining the team, resulting in an increase in the hero's playing time, which allowed him to take advantage of the opportunity.
It's worth a lot because it's 15 points on top of doing a great job in a different role than usual.
Team leader Jimmy Butler once again praised the hero of Favorite.
"He can drive, he can score, he can defend, he can do anything for the team, he can do anything in any position because it's not his way of thinking, he's looking at the video, he's studying, he's figuring out where and how his teammates are going to be free, and he's figuring out what to do about it."
Before the start of this season, Butler likes the heroic strength of the losers and the sticky attitude to basketball.
That's why I invited them to start their individual practice at 4 a.m. and trained with them.
Butler once said, "He says what he thinks to everyone, and he doesn't back down, and I respect that kind of fighting spirit."
He is the kind of person who always talks about what he thinks, and if he thinks it's for the team, he knows that a clash will happen, and he strikes a harsh opinion.
There have been times in the past when my relationship with my teammates has deteriorated.
Butler seems to have overlaid his youthful self with heroes.
The character of Butler, who is sometimes too harsh for his teammates, is a good guideline for those who have enough guts to come up with it.
If the relationship between the two mentors, who respect each other, spreads to the whole team, Heat should be a team that can aim even higher.

Shimada scored his first goal of the season with a 2–0 win over Matsuura.
He scored two more points in the game against Uchino Goro and Squiz.
He scored six goals in the first innings of the game, but was unable to score a point.
In the final round, Hamamatsu-jo Castle was unable to make use of the opportunity offered by the two dead bases.
The Fourth Battle of the Three Years
2 years Matsuura, thanksgiving preemptive strike
It was the fourth time in two years that the team had played in the first round this summer.
Shimada Shosho's Matsuura hit the change ball in the first inning and carried it to the left front.
"If I lost for three years, I would retire immediately.I wanted to beat and win."
Last autumn, Ishizaki, who took the fourth position, was also cheerful.
The first and second rounds were contested over three days, and the third round was contested over two days.
Director Ikeda gathered the players at the meeting and told Nain, "Three years have brought us together and I'm going to be the best member in the future."
On this day, four of the nine Stamens solidified the main axis in two years.
It's a proof that he's committed to a serious fight, even though it looks pitiful.
Matsuura said, "From now on, the level of the opponent's pitcher will also rise.I intend to return the runner."
Saito, who became a regular pitcher, threw a good run that kept him in the first base six times and did not even step on the second base for three years to show his determination.
Back number 10 is a positive perception as a synergy effect, "If you get two years, you will receive three years of stimulation.
The team that has been aiming for the fourth place for three consecutive years, including the Shizuoka tournament until last year, does not intend to create memories of the remaining matches.
16 musicians from Fukushima Prefecture gather to sing with locals (Fukushima Minpo) - Yahoo!News
I want to bring the cheerful singing voice of Hama, Naka and Aizu to the world.
Sixteen musicians associated with Fukushima Prefecture gathered and composed a message song.
The lyrics depict Fukushima Prefecture struggling to recover from the Great East Japan Earthquake and the Tokyo Electric Power Company's Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant accident, and the battle against a new type of coronavirus.
By the summer of next year, which will mark the tenth anniversary of the earthquake and tsunami, the full version will be completed.
The song was later released on YouTube.
The song is titled "Pray from Fukushima" (プレイ・フロム・フクシマ).
The positive attitude of the people is accompanied by a cheerful and energetic melody that expresses the desire to convey the message from Fukushima.
Due to the influence of the new colonna, the live house, which became the base of music activities, was forced to close down, and many musicians lost the opportunity to sing and perform.
In order to believe in the power of music, singer-songwriter nappo (46 years old), who lives in Minamisoma City, and DAZU-O (37 years old), who belongs to the music group "Mehikari Boys" of Iwaki City, planned the event.
Nappo is in charge of lyrics and composition, and Dazo is in charge of rap.
When the project started in March, singer-songwriter MANAMI (28) and Jun Sugano (38) from Fukushima City agreed one after another, and the circle expanded in an instant.
Mr. Nappo said, "It was a gorgeous face-to-face encounter that is unthinkable in ordinary times.I want to enjoy this opportunity to the fullest."
Sixteen people did not have the opportunity to gather as a countermeasure to the infection, and each recorded at a live house or at home.
In an effort to support the project, Koa, a painter from Iwaki City, drew an image of the character.
Based in Fukushima Prefecture, it represents a naturally rich climate of blue and green.
The song was released on YouTube, and is also available on CD.
Next year marks the tenth anniversary of the earthquake, and the Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games, which were postponed, will also be held.
"We have overcome a lot of difficulties," said Dazo, "and it would be great if we could inspire many people by releasing a song at a turning point."
The other musicians are as follows.

This is not only true for news organizations such as television and newspapers, but also for many companies such as social infrastructure companies and local governments.
Specificity, a service developed by Spectee that deals with information analysis by AI, responds to this need.

Now, the means by which people first learn about the occurrence of disasters and accidents has begun to shift from television to online information (social media).
Social media, such as Twitter, has become an important medium for disseminating information immediately after a disaster or accident occurs.
However, it is difficult to keep track of the information that is overflowing and extract useful information from it manually.
Specti detects information about natural disasters and accidents from social media such as Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook, analyzes the content, determines the truthfulness of the information, and distributes it to the user companies.
"Crisis management support service that visualizes various crises occurring in Japan and overseas is widely regarded as a "crisis" that has a negative impact that stops or stagnates social activities" (Murakami Kenjiro, CEO).
NHK's use of Specti during the Kumamoto earthquake in April 2016 was the first major use of Specti, and subsequently, the movement for adoption spread rapidly among companies.
Not only television stations and newspapers, but also companies that support social infrastructure such as electricity, gas, and transportation, as well as local governments throughout the country, are currently using Specti.
■ Analyze the post to determine the type of "crisis" and the place where it occurred
Specti delivers information in four steps: "Collection of information", "Analysis and content classification", "Title assignment", and "Truth/False judgement".
Companies that use it must specify in advance the region in which the information is to be collected (prefectures, municipalities, etc.) and the category of crisis (disasters and accidents, etc.).
Specti collects posts that fall under its designation using an API provided by social media.
It then analyzes and categorizes the text, images, and videos contained in the collected posts.
For example, if there is a video showing a fire engine, black smoke rising from a building, and an orange flame from a room, it is classified as a "fire".
In addition, images of vehicles that have rolled over are classified as "traffic accidents" , and images of roads covered with water are classified as "road crown water".
Specti also estimates the location of disasters and accidents.
"We often don't know the location from the post, so we're combining various information to make an estimate," says Murakami.
For example, if a road sign or signboard is projected onto an image or video, information about a place name is extracted from it and matched with a place name database to identify the location.

In Nagano Prefecture, there is a risk of heavy rain mainly in the southern part of the prefecture for the next 26 days, and it is necessary to be vigilant for landslides in the central and southern parts.
In Qiaoki Village, the circuit of the prefectural road that is closed to traffic is washed away, and the residents are isolated again.
Soil and temporary bridges are drunk in the flooded river, and it is flowing.
After 3:00 a.m., a surveillance camera installed by Iida Construction Office in Qiaoki Village was detected.
Instead of the prefectural road, which was closed due to landslides, this circuit was built on the banks of a river, and from the 17th, it was only accessible to residents' cars.
As a result, 56 people from 33 households in the Oshima area have become isolated again, and the Iida Construction Office wants to begin restoration work as soon as the water runs out.

It is Chiba people near Tokyo.
I have lived in this prefecture for about 30 years since I was born.
When I used it in a conversation with a friend at a university (Tokyo), it was instantly pronounced kyoton.
You could understand the meaning by the flow and the sense of words, but people in Tokyo and Saitama prefectures said that they would not use it.

And it seems to be connected, so the meaning can be guessed somehow.
Then, one more.
Although I didn't notice this because it was pointed out, the expression "Uchinchi," which means "my home," was not used at all even when I read books and so on, and I had to ask my friends not to, so I looked it up as an adult and it was a dialect.

"Japan's "cool Chinese" doesn't suit Chinese people ...?
" cold noodle dishes"不人気のワケ(現代ビジネス ) - Yahoo!ニュース
In China, "冷やし中華" means "Japanese cold noodles".
As mentioned at the beginning, cold Chinese is a Chinese dish (日本中華) originating in Japan, which was invented based on the Chinese '涼拌面 (リャンバンミエン/冷やし混ぜそば)'.
Thus, although it does not originally exist in China, due to the diversification of food, it has come to be seen in Japanese restaurants in the summer.
Recently, Japanese convenience stores have also introduced arrangement products called "日本蕎麦涼面/蕎麦冷やし中華" and "川香鶏絲涼面/四川風鶏冷やし中華".
On the other hand, Chinese cuisine such as Sichuan cuisine and Hunan cuisine were pushed by popular punch-effect Chinese cuisine, and the popularity of Japanese-style Chinese cuisine in China was not high overall.
Of course, Japanese-Chinese flavoring is often familiar to Chinese people as well.
Therefore, it is not tasty, but it tends to be badly criticized as having little impact.
"Chinese" is not an exception to this, and is still a minor presence in China.
Incidentally, the name of cold Chinese noodles in China is "Japanese cold noodles".
For Chinese people, it is recognized as one of the Japanese dishes.
Summer's standard is "涼皮(リャンピー) ."
In China, the noodle dish that feels summer is "涼皮 (リャンピー) ."
In Japan, there are many people who are not familiar with it, but Ryohi is a flat noodle made from wheat flour, rice flour, starch, etc. originated in Shaanxi Province.
It is said to have a history of more than 2000 years.
It is a staple of B-class gourmet food sold at stalls, and the price is very reasonable around 10 to 20 yuan (150 to 300 yen).
It contains the character '涼' (涼), but like Japanese cold Chinese, it is not made with ice.
Rather, the temperature is constant.
On top of the noodles, pickled cucumbers, carrots, boiled peanuts and other ingredients of your choice are topped with spices such as parsley, pepper, ginger and garlic.
Finally, it is finished with a special seasoning mixed with soy sauce, soybean oil, vinegar, sesame paste and peanut paste.
The noodles are good for passing through the throat, and the sour and rich spicy sauce is well intertwined with the pull-pull noodles.
In addition, because it is permeating all over China, there are various toppings and flavorings, and the abundance of variations is also a characteristic of cool skin, and it is one of the ways to enjoy.

"Cold water shower" brings benefits to body and mind (コスモポリタン ) - Yahoo!ニュース
Suppresses inflammation such as muscle pain
A study published in The North American Journal of Medical Sciences investigating the efficacy of hydrotherapy (a water-based treatment) found that it can be expected to have both physical and mental healing effects.
By bathing in cold water after exercise, muscle pain and other inflammatory effects can be suppressed.
"It's important to exercise and take a cold shower as early as possible," says Douglas Cassa, head of the Korey Stringer Institute for Sports Medicine and professor at the University of Connecticut.
Reduces fatigue
When you exercise in high temperatures, your heart, muscles, and skin need more blood flow than usual.
"When you exercise, your heart rate increases, so your blood flow to the heart increases, and your muscles need more energy to contract, so your blood flow to your muscles increases," says Professor Casa.
"Breathing a cold water shower lowers the skin's temperature, reducing blood flow to the skin; instead, it sends blood to internal organs such as the stomach and intestines, making it easier for the body to absorb moisture and nutrients after exercise, thereby reducing the fatigue felt after exercise."
Expectations on the Holmes effect
Dr. Drozhevsky also explains that by bathing in cold water, we can expect the "hormicity effect" to be activated.
The term holistic effect refers to the idea that there should be little or no harmful substances or stress in the body, rather than nothing at all.
"Low-oxygen exercise, a bit of fasting, and a cold shower are examples of the holistic effects that can be expected for good health.By taking a cold shower, hormones and neurotransmitters can be stimulated, and physical and physical strength and resilience can be enhanced."

The high-flying ball landed in the middle of the left wing seat.
Daisen fired two consecutive shots at the arch and circled the diamond.
When I returned to the bench, I saw white teeth.
"While I was able to make a good swing, I was able to narrow down the target ball and make a bold swing."
He scored 0–2 at the start of the game.
It is the second game to be played after the first and the second game after the third.
I didn't miss Ono's sweet 134 km slider.
The ball that is caught with the core is a perfect hit that makes you believe that you are standing in the moment you hit it.
Two days later, at the Battle of Hiroshima (Koshien) on the 23rd of the previous day, a shot was fired to counterattack.
It was also a worthy one that I hit from the opponent that I didn't like.
He scored nine goals and four assists against Ōnoo at Koshien on the 17th.
However, in the last 12 games, he allowed 7 wins, 1 loss and 1 hold, and suffered 7 consecutive defeats from 23 August 2013.
At the end of the match, he scored 23 goals in the first inning of the match (he also scored a goal in the second inning of the game) and was unable to pass the game.
Director Yano also expressed his expectation for a further explosion, saying, "It's a high level to be able to hold a sweet ball firmly.I'm looking at it and it's stylish, and the timing of hitting has an atmosphere even in fouls.I think it will still hit."
He scored a right-handed first-half goal in six consecutive games and a right-handed second-half goal in three consecutive games.
Although the season started off well, with seven home runs and 16 assists, he was already the team's top scorer and fourth overall.
For the sake of victory, I will continue to leave the results.

Japan's rugby sevens head coach Kensuke Iwabuchi told reporters online on May 25 that he is determined to "work together to achieve the goal of winning a medal" in the Tokyo Olympics, which was postponed until next year.
Following the postponement of the 2016 Summer Olympics, the Rio de Janeiro Olympics head coach Yusaku Kuwamizu (コカ・コーラ) and Fukuoka captain Kenki (パナソニック) left the team.
The commander said, "Of course, the impact is great, but we will move forward with players who can fight together."
From that day onwards, the team was divided into Tokyo and Oita and began training camp for the national team.
Accommodation camps have been held since March and until the 28th, but practice with contact is not conducted as a measure to prevent infection with the new-type coronavirus.
The team was relegated to the seven-man World Series (WS) from the following season, but due to uncertainty about the World Series itself, Iwabuchi HC announced that it was negotiating a reinforcement match with countries that would allow the team to enter the tournament.

Macau Casino Supervisory Authority Inspects the Implementation Status of Anti-Epidemic Measures at Casino Facilities...Presentation of New Colon Virus Negative Certificate at Entry Required (Macau Newspaper) - Yahoo!News
About 40 casinos in Macau were closed for 15 days from February 5 to 19 due to the outbreak of the new-generation cholera virus (COVID-19), and after 20 February, they resumed operations under strict anti-epidemic measures.
The Macau Casino Regulatory Authority (DICJ) requires the operating company to protect the health of employees and guests to the maximum extent when reopening, ensuring the distance between gaming (casino) tables, opening adjacent seats in table games (e.g. baccarat tables can seat three to four people at the same time), and operating slot machines once or twice, in order to reduce the risk of cross-infection.
Disinfection of gaming equipment, such as chips, is also being strengthened.
Guests are also required to wear a mask, have a thermometer, and present a valid health code (including a recent residence record, contact history with a newborn colonist, symptoms such as fever and cough, and contact information generated by entering the code).
From 0 a.m. on July 15, a negative certificate of the newly developed colonavirus nucleic acid test (limited to validity periods issued by authorized facilities in Macao or Guangdong) was also required.
The new requirement to present a negative certificate is based on the relaxation of the waterfront measures between Macao and Guangdong Province (with the abolition of quarantine quarantine for 14 days, subject to certain conditions) from 6 a.m. on the 15th, as a precautionary measure.
On July 18, DICJ announced that following the change in admission conditions from July 15, DICJ Director General Adriano Ho inspected the implementation of anti-epidemic measures at the casino facilities and held a meeting with representatives of the security departments of six casino operators to reiterate their request to protect the health of employees and guests by thoroughly managing guest admission.
DICJ stated that it will continue to conduct strict patrols of the casino facilities, hold regular meetings with the operating companies in accordance with the situation and evaluation, and coordinate the anti-epidemic measures at the casinos as appropriate in accordance with the guidelines of the Government Health Bureau.
Dr. Hayashimatsu, director of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention of the Hygiene Bureau, accompanied the visitors to the casino and gave them instructions on the disinfection of gaming chips and how to maintain a safe distance between the seats of electronic casino equipment.
Due to a sharp decline in inbound passengers due to anti-epidemic measures including entry restrictions, cumulative casino sales from January to June this year remained at 337.20 billion Macao pataca (Japanese yen equivalent: about 451.9 billion yen), down 77.4% from the same period of the previous year.
A message to medical workers from Yuwaku Onsen next month, bonbori festival instead (Kitakuni Shimbun) - Yahoo!News
At Yuwaku Onsen, where the annual Yuwaku Bonbori Festival has been cancelled due to the effects of a new type of coronavirus, efforts to encourage bonbori with messages of support to healthcare workers will begin on August 1.
Fans and local residents from all over the country write on paper and stick it on about 350 banners, wrapping the town of Yu with the light of ale, and delivering healing to visitors.
The Bonbori Festival is an event that recreates the festival that appears in the anime "Hanasaki Kuroha" based on Yuwaku Onsen, and is organized by the Yuwaku Onsen Tourism Association.
The series began airing in 2011 and is visited by many anime fans from all over the country every year.
Every year, from the lighting ceremony in July to the main festival in October, bonbori are placed on the stairs leading to Yuwaku Inari-jinja Shrine next to Soyu and lit up.
This year, the festival was forced to be cancelled due to the new corona, but local and national fans said "It is lonely that there is no bonbori in the summer of Yuwaku" one after another, and the association devised this project.
He called it the "Recovery Campaign" to help the world heal and recover from the scourge of the corona.
So far, about 50 students from Yuwaku and Shibahara have written messages with illustrations, and there are more than 100 entries from all over Japan.
The message paper is purchased from the association's homepage, filled in, and sent to the association in a reply envelope, where you can receive a photo with a light attached to a bonbori.
Applications are accepted until the total number of bonbori reaches about 350 for a set of 6,000 yen.
The lights are expected to be on by the end of November.
Mr. Shinichiro Yamashita, 48, who has served as the festival's executive committee chairman since the first festival, said, "Reading the message encourages us, too, and we want to hold the festival, which will be the 10th milestone, grandly next year."
For the campaign, I also prepared a drawing illustration of the character of Hanasaki Kuroha and Asanogawa Ohashi.
From the first day, a clear file with illustrations will be presented to users of the special accommodation plan at Yuwaku Onsen inn.
"Supporting the Seibu's Core 4: Moriyama Outer Source of the Soul" (東スポWeb) - Yahoo!ニュース
"Moriyama Gaigen," of which Seibu is proud, showed the cooperation of the soul and directed the season's second victory.
On the 24th, at the Battle of Lotte (MetLife), two to two nine times, the four who were still far weak showed an obsession with victory.
In the first round, the first baseman from the first baseman's team was eliminated by a head-slide.
Then, in the last six games, Mori, who was on the bottom of the field with a batting rate of 10 percent to 2 percent, sent the batter and scored a deadly second base.
The fourth-placed Yamakawa was disqualified and replaced by Mori on that day, and the fifth-placed Tosaki broke Masuda's straight ball, leading to a 3-2 victory.
"(Genda's safety team) I was also on the bench, and I thought I had to do something," said hero Toosaki, "and I felt that Tomoya believed in me behind the bench and connected me with the bench, too."Yamakawa said, "Be proactive before you go to the first base with respect, and that made me feel good."
In the 13th year of the draft, Mori, Yamakawa, Togasaki, and Genda were ranked 1st and 2nd, respectively, and in the 16th year they were ranked 3rd and 4th.
All of them have master-general experience in the amateur era, and the sense of responsibility is twice that of a person.
Toshizaki, who took over the captain from Yamakawa in his fourth year at Fuji University, said, "Mr. Yamakawa is the captain who pulls the team with words because he is good at chatting anyway.On the contrary, I was the type who left chatting to the deputy captain who is good at chatting because I am bad at speaking, and stood behind him."
Director Tsuji said, "Genda's safety?That's not a sign, but that's when I thought, 'I can go.'Tomoya was also a great batter, and Toosaki played well."
All four of them are currently suffering from a hit rate of 40% to 5%, but they are supporting the team with wisdom to win even if they don't hit.

鋳銭司に大村益次郎像 教育者としての功績伝える【山口】|宇部日報 このまちメディアWeb
On the 23rd, a bronze statue of Masujiro OMURA (1825-69), one of the 10 great leaders of the Meiji Restoration, was displayed in the minting office of Yamaguchi City, where he was born.
An unveiling ceremony was held in the front yard of the Tsusenji Community Exchange Center, where local and government officials celebrated the completion.
Masujiro was a military scholar, a Western scholar, and a physician in the late Edo period and the Meiji period.
After becoming a lecturer at Bansho Shirabesho, a research and education institution for Western studies in the bakufu, he opened a private school, Hatoido, in Edo to teach Western studies, military science, and medicine.
After returning to Choshu Domain, he gave lectures on military science at the Meirinkan in Yamaguchi.
The statue focused on Masujiro as an educator.
He stood by the globe, holding a book in his hand, and gave lectures on Western studies.
The height of the statue with the pedestal is about 3 meters (1.55 meters for the statue), and it is said that it was made from the point of view of a disciple who attended Masujiro's lecture.
The design was done by Masujiro's wife, a descendant of Kotoko, and a local designer, Marie Takami (27).
150 years after the death of Masujiro OMURA, who was the mother of the Chusenji Autonomous Association, the Project Implementation Committee (Chairman Toshi OKAMOTO) solicited donations to build it.
Approximately 1,280 million yen of purified goods were collected from 1,104 people nationwide.
The cost of the project, including the installation of the nameplate, is about 12 million yen.
The remaining donations will be used for the maintenance of the statue.
President Okamoto said, "Masujiro, who has continued to have high aspirations and made great contributions as an educator, is the pride of Furusato, a bronze statue that will be the hope of the children of the region who will take charge of the future."

Online museum "HASARD" Konno-san (born in Hachinohe) launched (デーリー東北新聞社 ) - Yahoo!ニュース
There is a museum where anyone can touch art free of charge whenever they want.
There is a wide range of artists, from famous painters such as Claude Monet and Gustav Klimt to unknown artists in Japan.
Since its "opening" in April 2019, the online art museum "HASARD" has captured the hearts of users with its convenience and novelty, and has attracted even more attention due to the new lifestyle caused by the coronal plague.
Shinnosuke Konno, a 26-year-old resident of Tokyo, who launched the site, says, "I wanted to create a service that everyone could easily enjoy art, and I wanted people to come into contact with art under difficult circumstances."
When you visit Azar, you will be surprised by the richness of the exhibition and the beauty of the images.
As of today, the museum has opened a total of 14 permanent and planned exhibitions, attracting viewers not only for its color, but also for its ultra-high-resolution works that convey the texture of the brush.
Membership registration and admission fees are not required, and it is characterized by the fact that not only the viewer, but also artists who want to open a solo exhibition do not have to pay.
The way it is presented online also attracts attention.
One of them is to move the painting.
In Claude Monet's permanent exhibition, "It Begins to Move Again," he digitally processes clouds, flowers, grasslands, and so on to make them move.
"I want to make it possible for people who are not interested in art to get in" (Konno representative), so you can feel like you are in a painting.
The school's art department and art department were established in the early years of the school.
When I visited the recently completed Aomori Prefectural Museum of Art with my family, I was shocked by the power of Marc Chagall's three huge paintings of "Alec".
The next day, art classes turned into a fun time, and even after going to Tokyo to attend university, he began to visit galleries and other places.
At the same time, I felt that many people do not have much opportunity to interact with art from various perspectives, such as the fact that the museum is not nearby, large-scale exhibitions are held only in the metropolitan area, and it is difficult to go out for childcare.
So, while working for an IT company, I spent about two months creating a website where I could view art on the Internet.
The number of users reached an average of 10,000 per month in the first 10 months, and after the spread of the new colony, it increased to about 30,000.
Whenever anyone wants to see, if they can appreciate art in a free form.
The aim of Azer was unwittingly accepted by more people due to the coronal plague.
Mr. Konno emphasized the significance of art appreciation for enriching one's imagination.
"When you have a lot of imagination, you can reach out to people who are in trouble.
I want art to become a better society by becoming familiar with it."
China's quality era ends, Japan's quality era comes simple reason (Modern Business) - Yahoo!News
Changing Values in the Pandemic
Various predictions and discussions have been made about the post-pandemic world.
On the business side, there is a possibility that the changes described in the article of July 8, "In fact, the work of "management" in Japan is now beginning to disappear ... ! its cruel reality ," and the article of July 4, "In the world of "After Corona," it is actually "Japanese manufacturing industry" is likely to revive greatly ... ! ", etc.
[Photo] The true nature of "Japanese Strength" that only Japanese people do not know...A surprising reality seen in Asia
From the spiritual point of view, it seems that the trend will become mainstream, such as the article of June 26, "The principle of complete burning to give to people who became conscious of the end of life in the colonna" , and the article of June 10, "The colonna, now full of riots, let's reconsider the effectiveness of "God's Reliance in Times of Suffering".
And it seems that the great flow from "Chinese quality to Japanese quality" will become clear to our eyes as the combination of the two "materials (economy and business)" and "spirit".
For example, it is outrageous if there are defects or defects in a T-shirt or a digital camera, but the life of the person who purchased it is no different.
On the other hand, the poor quality of masks and respirators made in China, which has recently become a topic of discussion ... ... "Chinese quality" in products that are directly linked to life and safety is fatal.
No matter how cheap it is, such goods cannot be purchased.
Even if you pay a considerable price, you will still want products of 'Japanese quality.'
Of course, this trend is not only happening in Japan.
It is also clear from the fact that Western countries, which were in a difficult situation due to a shortage of masks and medical equipment, still "returned" one after another due to the terrible "Chinese quality".
安さよりも安心・安全
In addition, products such as automobiles can be fatally defective (death by accident).
No matter how many countries, including China and South Korea, attack with cheap selling strategies of "cheap or bad," in the end, it is not possible to strike a sword at Japanese manufacturers, and the situation such as stated in the article on June 16, "Are the world's automobile manufacturers going to surrender to Toyota after all?" is because "Japanese quality" is strongly demanded for automobile products.
This pandemic reminded us that many other products need to be safe and secure.
In addition, safety and security are important not only for "Japanese quality in manufacturing" but also for "Japanese quality in logistics and other services."
Like toilet paper noise, even though production capacity is adequate, intermediate distribution may be delayed and not reachable.
Furthermore, as in the article of April 17, "Who is the real culprit of the lack of masks!Do not forgive the fireplace thieves of the Communist Party of China regime," I strongly felt that self-sufficiency in Japan is also an important element of "security and safety."
It is very important for any country to be able to procure essential supplies such as masks (medical equipment) and food at home.
Korea's new colony infects more than 100 people in 115 days (聯合ニュース ) - Yahoo!ニュース
According to Yonhap News, (SEOUL=Yonhap News) South Korea's Central Bureau of Anti-Epidemic Measures announced today that the number of people infected with the new-type coronavirus has increased by 113 since 0:00 a.m. the previous day, to a total of 14,092.
The number of new infections per day exceeded 100 for the first time in 115 days since April 1 (101 people).
It is believed that 32 of the 293 workers who returned from Iraq on the 24th were positively assessed, in addition to 32 crew members who were found to have been infected by a Russian ship that entered Busan Port.

Nagoya Miyahara is the first player to be promoted to J1 League | 静岡新聞アットエス
Football J1 Nagoya announced on May 25 that Kazuya Miyahara, 24, of the Japanese national football team, has been confirmed to have a positive reaction to a new type of coronavirus.
After the restart of the J League, the player's positive reaction this time.
He is the club's third player, after FW Yumeo Kanazaki (31) and Australian goalkeeper Mitchell Langerac (31), who contracted the disease in June.
The two had already been treated and returned to the game.
This season's Miyahara entered the bench on the 22nd in the J1 Oita match held at Showa Denko Dome Oita.
Nagoya held an online press conference on the 25th, revealing that it had conducted PCR tests on 60 players and staff on the same day.

It turns out that white paint from Teflon-processed frying pan, heat insulation increases the cooling effect!
No way!
This year, the rainy season was marked by an unprecedented amount of precipitation, but the hot summer becomes full-fledged at dawn.
It's hot, it's hot, it's hot, and even the cooling doesn't work very well.
Global warming is a major global problem, and mankind has been refining its wisdom on how to overcome the heat of midsummer comfortably.
One way is to wear thin white clothes.
You don't have to wear black clothes to absorb heat in summer, do you?
And applying the same principle to the architecture of houses, the number of cases using white paints seems to be increasing.
Even if white is white, it cannot be a coating with a characteristic that reflects more light and does not absorb heat.
Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) and researchers from the Department of Applied Physics and Applied Mathematics at Columbia University have found the most efficient way to recycle solar heat and improve the cooling effect of building interiors.
It is aimed at early practical use.
Until now, the white coatings with the highest reflectivity of sunlight used titanium oxide, which has a reflectivity of 85%.
White paints that already use titanium oxide are applied to the roofs of buildings in high-temperature environments and are used to block out the sun's heat to increase cooling efficiency.
However, the newly discovered white coating is derived from the fluorine resin of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), which is used in teflon-processed frying pans and so on.
It is a white coating that applies this teflon effect and reflects up to 98% of the sun's rays, enabling significant heat cuts.
Even in the hot summer, thanks to the white paint using Teflon, the indoors are easy to spend without being exposed to the intense heat.
Such an era may be coming soon, right?
I think the roofs of Japanese houses have a lot of dark colors, but will white be the mainstream from now on?
When will Amazon's annual large-scale sale be held this year?
On July 21, CNBC reported that Amazon.com had announced that it would postpone its annual large-scale prime-day sale.
It is held annually in July, but this year it was reportedly forced to be postponed due to the spread of a new type of coronavirus infection.
A spokesman for Amazon said in a statement: "The details will be announced shortly."
"Prime Day has become a special celebration event that we have been looking forward to over the past five years, and this year we will be holding it at a later time than usual, while ensuring the safety of our employees and supporting our customers and exhibitors."
However, it did not specify a specific date, stating that "details will be announced shortly".
However, it was decided to hold the event in India.
A press release was published on the site.
On August 6, it was explained that it would be carried out from 0 a.m. to 48 hours.
Prime Day has been held simultaneously around the world so far, but this year may take an unusual measure.
In 2015, Amazon launched a large-scale sales campaign for its members as part of its efforts to boost sales in the summer months when sales are declining.
It was originally a 24-hour event, but has grown in scale each year, and last year it was held from 0 a.m. to 48 hours on July 15 in 18 countries including the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, India, Japan, China, and Australia.
According to the company, last year's two-day sales surpassed previous sales on Black Friday (the first day of the year-end sales campaign) and Cyber Monday (the following Monday).
This event has also contributed to the acquisition of new subscribers for premium paid members, and last year, the number of applications on the first day was the highest in a day, and the number of applications on the next day was the next.
Last year, the company sold 175 million items worldwide.
Internet Retailer, a specialist magazine in the online retailing industry, reported that global sales for the two days were $71.6 billion, up 70% from the previous year.
Mobile phone number transfer, strict eyes on excessive retention.
How will fees and points be awarded?
(New Switch) - Yahoo!News
The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications is conducting a full-scale review of the Mobile Number Transfer System (MNP), which allows users to change their phone numbers as they are.
At a meeting of experts held on 21 March, he outlined his policy to revise the guidelines of the MNP, which had been established in 2004.
Specific issues include how MNP fees should be allocated and whether or not to detain those who wish to relocate.
While opposition from telecommunications companies is also expected, attention will be focused on whether it will lead to the promotion of healthy market competition.
Unlimited mobile phone transfers are so far away When dark MNP of communication companies was introduced in 2006, the user fee was 2000 yen, but now it is 3000 yen.
It is estimated that the MNP fee revenue of the three major mobile communications companies amounts to 15.9 billion yen annually.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications (MIC) listed the current state of MNP at the "Working Group on Verification of Competition Rules (WG)", a meeting of experts to discuss the competitive environment in the telecommunications market.
The time required for consumers to receive MNP reservation numbers when transferring to other telecommunications companies was also highlighted.
The main entrance to the station is on the west side of the station building, and the main entrance to the station building is on the east side of the station building, from 9 a.m. to 8 p.m.
As a guideline for future discussions, the documents of the working group clearly stated that all-day response was the principle.
It is also a problem that mobile phone companies try to retain people who want to transfer to MNP by giving them points.
Excessive retention may impede fair competition.
Mr. Shunichi Kita, a partner at Nomura Research Institute, who serves as a member of the working group, recommends that "we should have time to explain the economic benefits provided, or obtain permission from users, and issue a number to users who do not consent to it quickly and end it.It is important to thoroughly complete this process first."
However, among a series of issues, there is a structural problem concerning MNP fees: "The higher the MNP fees, the more difficult it is for customers to withdraw, so it is difficult to motivate them to actively lower them" (a person in charge of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications).
If a company takes the lead in lowering its MNP fees, it is also feared that the outflow of customers from the company will increase and that the company's efforts will not be rewarded.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications has pointed out that many countries overseas do not charge user fees for MNP, and it is possible that this will happen in Japan as well.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications intends to summarize the results of the working group as a report around September-October, and then begin the process of revising the MNP guidelines.
It is expected that the revision will take place after 21 years.
Mobile communications companies are likely to be troublesome, including sales and customer support.

"Japan's hockey team wins Olympic gold medal" (Press release).
G-Osaka's Tsuneyasu Miyamoto, 43, spoke to reporters ahead of a four-game series against Kobe (November 26) and expressed his expectations for third-year high school player Shoji Karayama, 17, who joined the top team for the first time the previous week.
The commanding officer made Karayama, who was promoted to the top flight class this season, a bench member at the 22nd Battle of Hiroshima.
I didn't give him a chance to play, but he told the striker, who has scored three goals and scored in five games so far this season in J3, "There's something outstanding about scoring.I'm 17 years old, but I want him to be more and more gum-sharp.I've seen players go overseas at a young age, but I want him to play with a high level of consciousness and desire."
Tangshan scored 8 goals in 10 games last season in J3, where he was a specially designated player.
He is 178 cm, 65 kg and slim, but he has a sense of taking the back of the D.F. with an instantaneous movement, calmness to the shot before a crowded opponent's goal, etc.He boasts 11 goals and an amazing scoring rate in 15 games in J3.
In the match against Hiroshima, F.W. Ademiuson and M.F. Onose were out of the bench due to injury, and Karayama got a chance, but did not have the opportunity to participate.

If the two of them survive, the possibility of a bench in Tangshan will arise again.
In Osaka, FC Doan made his J1 debut at the age of 16 and 11 months, while FC Usami made his international debut at the age of 17 and 10 months.
Karayama, who is now 17 years and 10 months old, is expected to make his J1 debut as a follow-up to them.

In 1994, Ferrari Mondeal was stolen in the Netherlands.
Although time passed without the police being able to resolve the matter, it was said that 26 years later, the Mondial was miraculously discovered.
Ferrari found at the bottom of the river (four photos) The trigger for the discovery was diving training at the fire station.
On 8 July, a diver in training spotted something of a wage-shape sinking to the bottom of the river, and the police and even the Dutch army came out and pulled it up to where Ferrari Mondial was.
By matching the VIN number with the database of the stolen vehicle, the Ferrari could be linked to the 1994 incident.
The car is delivered to the insurance company, which is the legal owner, and then sent to the scrapper.
Lowie van DE Ooyevaar, a scrapper, says, "There are still some parts left, but they're for the art of decorating, and we've already received a lot of requests from people who want to make tables out of discarded Mondials, using engine blocks and glass plates."
For the time being, we don't have any plans to sell it, and the scrap dealers will keep it as an object.

"Review: 'I Have No Memory'".
The 27-year-old, who was also stimulated by the fact that his alma mater, Aomori University's Sanetaka Hirosaki, made it to the top four of the prefectural championships for the first time in 20 years, was showered with joy and smiled, "As expected, it felt good."
He was called "The Man I Don't Have".
As a versatile player who can protect both indoors and outdoors, he was selected as a Samurai Japan player, and contributed the world's best at the "Premium 12" in November last year.
However, he had no experience of sayonara hitting in Seibu, and Tsuji director and Baba operations and defense and running base coach told him "I don't have it, you".
It was a disappointment for the club, and they won their second consecutive title this season.
Director Tsuji said, "I only asked the Goddess of Victory today, and she hit me well."
It is the second-largest game in the series, behind the first-season and second-season games.
This season there is only one home run, and with a batting rate of 252, Togasaki said, "We have not hit yet.We aim to win the next one, and we will do it as a team."
One of the reasons for this decision is to restart the game.

Heavy rain, "traffic" in the far north, nail marks National Route 152 10 km traffic stop, part of the JR Iida Line is not accessible|静岡新聞アットエス
A line of cars waiting for the passage of the alternating detour on one side, Hamamatsu-shi, Tenryu-ku, Ryuzan-cho (part of the photo is processed)
The Tenryu area of Hamamatsu City was also severely affected in Shizuoka Prefecture by the heavy rains in July, which caused severe damage throughout Japan, including Kyushu.
Due to the effects of the earthquake on the main road, National Route 152, and the JR Iida Line, many areas require time to be restored.
In addition to the inconvenience of daily life, residents are increasingly concerned about the negative impact on economic activities.
At Sejiri Bridge on the Tenryu-gawa River in Longshan Town, Longshan District, a long queue of cars continues to pass through during the day.
The first car stopped for nearly 40 minutes.
National Route 152 is closed for about 10 kilometers, and it is necessary to detour to the opposite bank of the Tenryu River to get around the town.
However, the width of the road is narrow, and the entire section is alternating on one side, and the waiting time is unpredictable.
On the 9th, a landslide occurred on the national highway in the town, and the road was closed due to the danger of falling rocks on the nearby slope.
On the 13th, cracks were also found in the autumn leaves tunnel in the restricted section, and the signs for the resumption of traffic have not yet been erected.
In 2018, the city was hit by a landslide that blocked the national highway, affecting residents' livelihoods and tourism.
Mr. Kimieda Tamamoto, 76, a representative of the Dragon Mama processing plant, which sells specialty products, says, "The new coronavirus has driven away the number of visitors, and the number of visitors has decreased significantly."
The JR Iida Line is inaccessible between Mizukubo Station (Mizukubo-cho, Mizukubo Ward) and Hiraoka Station (Nagano Prefecture) due to a slope collapse on the side of the line.
Shiori Ukai, 16, who used to go to the Hamamatsu Hubei Kosaku-ma Branch School in Sakuma-cho, Futsu Ward from Oarashi Station in Futsu Ward, needed a one-way car transfer of about one hour.
"Cars are a big burden for parents and myself," he says, hoping for an early recovery.
According to JR Tokai, it is estimated that it will take about three months until the reopening, and from the 27th onwards, it will operate a temporary train that runs between Mizukubo Station and Oarashi Station in the morning and evening on weekdays.
In the town of Mizukubo, landslides frequently occur on forest roads, which are also used as a livelihood road.
This can take several hours to complete.
Keiji Kumagai, 69, president of the Mizukubo Town Forestry Association, said, "The harvesting of timber has been delayed.There are isolated islands on land everywhere.I am worried about the rain in the future."

45% of households have a wife holding a wallet!
Such my husband, happy? unhappy?
"I don't have enough for this month's allowance ..." Isn't there a wife who gets upset when her husband tells her, or is she upset?
The family in which this conversation takes place is the one in which the wife holds the wallet.
How many families in the world have a wife holding a wallet?
Let's also take a look at the percentage of "spousal wallet" and "shared management".
"Which of the Household's Wallets Are You Holding?".
Matsui Securities Co., Ltd. conducted an Internet survey of a total of 800 people, including 400 men and women in their twenties and thirties (young couples) and 400 women and men in their fifties and sixties (mature couples) who have been married for three years or more.
Who holds the purse of the household?
Wife: 45.0% Husband: 24.8% The highest number of households were those in which the wife managed the household.
Although there are twists and turns in the management of households, there seem to be various episodes.
My Wife Manages My Household: The Case of A-Child A-Child is an Arabic word mom with a third-year high school and first-year high school daughter.
Ms. Ako manages the household completely.
As I was preparing for university entrance exams, the cost of school fees increased and there were many months of deficit, so I negotiated with my husband to reduce the expenses, but I was resisted.
At that time, I was told to "show me what the income and expenditure is," so I showed the household ledger.
I should have listed all expenses, but when I looked at the household ledger, it wasn't enough to make a deficit.
My husband seemed to say "It's enough," but A-ko thoughtlessly "I understand, I am insufficient in household management, so please manage everything you please"If you cut the big picture, it seems to be returned with "Please after all."
Later, when Ako interviewed her husband, she said, "Although I am dissatisfied with the management of expenses, there is no time or energy to manage the various outgoings of the household (e.g., school materials expenses and PTA expenses, etc.).
The husband manages the household: The case of Bko Bko, a full-time housewife, receives her living expenses from her husband and manages them every day.
Last spring, the fridge part of the refrigerator broke, so Ms. B asked her husband to buy a refrigerator.
However, my husband said, "The freezer is not good, but you can still use the refrigerator part, so it's okay."I was reluctant to buy.
However, in the summer, it seems that the husband himself wanted to prepare an environment where he can eat ice cream at any time"Refrigerator, let's buy it after all"It seems that Taira turned around.
So Bko-san thoughtlessly complained to her friend, "The more you fuck your husband, the more you screw him."
"Spain 1st Division 5 Club narrowed down" (東スポWeb) - Yahoo!ニュース
This season, it seems that the transfer destination of the Japanese representative M.F. Kubo Kenei (19) who played in the Spanish 1st division Majorca is gradually narrowed.
Despite being relegated to the second division, Kubo's performance at the end of the season boosted his ratings.
However, it will be difficult for him to return to Real Madrid, who have a "holding right" to the club due to their non-EU status, and he plans to play for other clubs next season.
The offer has already been received from about 30 clubs, but Madrid intends to train wrestlers in domestic clubs.
The Spanish newspaper Marca reported that Kubo's move to Real Sociedad, as well as to Villarreal, Granada, Getafe and Betis, was likely to have a positive impact on the club's prospects: "Five clubs are interested in winning Kubo, but Real Madrid want a club that is above the mid-tier."
In particular, Villarreal and Real Sociedad will have the right to participate in the European League (EL) next season, and Granada will also join from the second qualifying round of the EL and match the team requirements requested by Real Madrid.
What kind of decision will the world's number one big club make on the departure of "Japan's greatest treasure"?
