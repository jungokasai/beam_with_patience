Father Joseph Witko: I saw Jesus in a white robe
He is a charismatic man.
The mass for the release and healing is attended by the crowds.
He was only a few years old when things began to happen in his life.
Today, through the Franciscan, others are experiencing it.
Crowds attend Fr Witko’s Mass for Liberation and Healing
Once, the parents of a 7-month-old child who had a hole of 7.5 mm in the heart came to him.
It was to be operated on.
Father Joseph Witko prayed over him.
The same day, the boy was taken to the hospital for treatment.
The doctors were astonished and said: “The surgery is not necessary, the loss is only 1.5 mm”.
Her parents were crying for her.
After another prayer, the Franciscan hole disappeared completely.
The spiritual extraordinary actions of the Creator began to experience as a teenager.
In his dreams, purifying souls came to him asking for help.
I was awakened at night and urged to pray for the dead and those who died at the moment – he recalls.
He also experienced the presence of an evil spirit.
And he had a vision of what happens to a man who commits mortal sin.
“My body started to change.
I lost my human characteristics and began to look like an animal,” he says.
The invisible force lifted him upwards, he could not make a voice out of himself.
He felt that he was lost.
Then God showed him the salvation.
“Drenched in the waters of the river symbolising the Holy Baptism, I was released and returned to my human form...”, he says.
He did not tell anyone about these strange experiences.
His vocation matured in him.
He was 16 when he joined the Franciscans.
He did not only want to talk about Jesus in his sermons.
He wanted people to experience Him alive.
Members of the charismatic community of Renewal in the Holy Spirit
Many people who are counting on getting rid of their illness attend healing masses celebrated by Father Witko.
The priest emphasizes, however, that their main goal is spiritual healing, not physical.
First defeat of Kolpinga FRAC Jarosław
Today (26 September) afternoon the Kolpinga FRAC team deservedly won the current Polish champion Dart Bogoria Grodzisk Mazowiecki in the 3rd LOTTO Superleague Table Tennis.
Their personality, as they presented it to the threatened, has little chance of winning against the league's sovereigns.
The match against Dartmouth was a notable success.
The team is still short of the team leader, Chen Jingqi.
The team would eventually win the league for the third time in a row in the next season.
The young Azjata Qiyao Han probably hasn't yet grown up to win with such trousers as the Greek Panagiotis Gionis or the Czech Pavel Sirucek.
Not even with one of the most promising Poles, Marek Badowski.
The player from Hellada was the biggest star of the match in the MOSiR hall at Sikorskiego Street in Jarosław.
Both in the fight with Qiyao Hanen and Kou Lei, he was a class of his own.
After three matches, Kolping led the FRAC 2-1.
Kou Lei probably defended Marek Badowski, and Daniel Górak after an exciting, five-point fight – Pavel Sirucka.
But then it was worse.
Gionis did not give Lei a chance.
He was able to win by two points, but Qiyao Han was unable to match Badowski.
There will be no additional research for seniors.
Why?
According to Rafał Trzaskowski, a program of free preventive tests for seniors aged 70 and 80 was to be introduced in Warsaw.
However, the idea will not be implemented because it has not been accepted by the Ministry of Health and the Agency for the Protection of Medical Technology and Tariffs.
In the explanatory statement, the agency explained that the target group was wrongly selected.
"The above actions may even result in the detection of individual disease units, which may contribute to the deepening of difficulties in accessing the benefits of the National Health Fund and negatively affect the patient, causing anxiety and discomfort associated with a false positive test result," it is written.
The decision of the Ministry is not understood by the President of the capital.
“The money is ours, we have planned the money for it.
The government is the only one who is afraid that if people examine themselves, they will later go to the doctor, which is absurd, because it is precisely to bring about a situation in which prevention can be carried out more quickly.
All specialists know that this helps in terms of burdening the health system, because it helps in the rapid detection of diseases and in a reliable approach to health.
The government has a very strange position here, which I do not understand”, said Rafał Trzaskowski.
“It is hard for me to imagine that competent specialists say: Let’s not examine ourselves, because there will be longer queues at the doctor’s office, and if such specialists advise the government, I am not surprised that the health service is in such a state”, added the politician of the Civic Platform.
Palestine responds to Israel: We will destroy all agreements to date
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas announced at the UN General Assembly on Thursday that he would break all agreements with Israel if the future government of that country tries to fulfill Benjamin Netanyahu's announcement about annexation of the occupied Palestinian territories.
"If the future government of Israel, which will be formed, proceeds to implement this plan, we will nullify all the agreements (with Israel) that have been signed and withdraw from all the commitments that have been made," he declared.
"We will reject the whole plan completely and completely," Abbas threatened under pressure.
“It is our duty to defend all our rights by all possible means, no matter what the consequences, by fully engaging in the application of international law and the fight against terrorism,” declared the President of the Palestinian Authority, who had already made similar statements in July.
Netanyahu, the current prime minister of Israel, was again given the task of forming a government after the September 17 elections.
A week before the election, he announced that if he won, he would annex the Jordan Valley and would annex all Jewish settlements in the West Bank to Israel.
In the early 1990s, Israel and the Palestinians, led by then-President Yasser Arafat, signed a series of peace agreements sponsored by the United States.
Abbas, 84, also promised to hold general elections in Palestinian lands during the UN General Assembly session.
The last one was in 2006.
“After returning to the country, I call for local elections in the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem, and all those who oppose them will have to answer for their actions before God and the international community,” the Palestinian president declared solemnly.
Abbas also defended in his speech the rights of Palestine, treated as a permanent observer in the UN, to exercise the powers of "full members of the UN and all its organs and institutions".
The Palestinian leader concluded by calling on the international community to "force Israel to comply with the United Nations resolutions with full respect".
Israeli Ambassador Danny Danon briefly responded to Abbas's speech, stating that the Palestinian leader "wants to focus the UN on the Palestinian Authority's efforts against Israel rather than fight the calls for terrorism in the Authority under his leadership".
However, Danon did not refer to the annexation of occupied Palestinian lands announced by Netanyahu.
Rescuers want defibrillators in the neuralgic points of Przemyśl
The history of the border crossing shows that an automatic AED defibrillator can save a human life.
The Provincial Rescue Station in Przemyśl wants such devices to be located in the most critical points of the city.
For their attitude, the officers received congratulatory diplomas from the Provincial Rescue Station in Przemyśl.
Applicant Daniel Cyrnek, senior applicant Grzegorz Bal and Commissioner Jacek Wójcik are officials of the Podkarpackie Customs and Treasury Office in Przemyśl.
On August 28, they were on duty at the Polish-Ukrainian border crossing in Medyka. A Customs and Excise Officer spotted a lying unconscious man in the pedestrian zone.
A Chinese activist died in custody as a result of torture.
He wanted to exercise the rights guaranteed by the Constitution
Cao Shuxia, the activist's wife, was called on September 23 by a Communist Party secretary from her home village to inform her that her husband had just died in Hengyang military hospital.
What was the cause of death – he did not reveal.
In the morgue, Cao saw her husband's body being slaughtered, unrecognizable.
“His eyes, ears, nose and mouth were all blood,” the woman says.
“They wouldn’t let me take my cells with me, and there were a lot of policemen around who couldn’t get close to Wang.”
The police insisted that she sign a statement stating that her husband was seriously ill and died as a result of an "unfortunate accident".
PLN 105 million for companies from the video game industry from the National Centre for Research and Development
Almost PLN 105 million of the funding will go to companies from the gaming industry, creating innovative solutions.
The National Centre for Research and Development announced on Friday the results of the third edition of the GameINN programme.
Among the nearly 30 projects supported by NCBR, there were: the development of a platform for creating terrain games based on the AR game engine that creates a map of the real world together with an application that allows users to transmit data; a test and training platform for verifying practical skills at work and professional development using VR and AI technologies; an innovative game simulating the management of real production processes using an innovative game model based on the interaction of the virtual world with the real world using the concept of Industry 4.0 – stated in the NCBR communication sent to PAP on Friday.
The aim of the GameINN sectoral programme is to increase the competitiveness of the Polish video game industry on the global market in the perspective of 2023.
As NCBR reports, the Polish video game sector is already growing at a rate of 10% per year.
According to government data, the value of the Polish video game market in 2016 amounted to PLN 1.85 billion, while the forecast for 2019 is PLN 2.23 billion.
"The specially prepared GameINN research agenda and the support for entrepreneurs under this sectoral programme, which already amounts to PLN 300 million, constitute an important impetus for the further, dynamic growth of Polish gamedev", reads the communication.
The video game industry is a perfect example of effective use of the potential we have in Poland.
"The incentives introduced by the government for entrepreneurs who are committed to innovation, such as R&D concessions, competence improvement programs, IP boxes or support programs implemented by NCBR, drive innovative activity of companies and allow them to compete more effectively on a very competitive market," says Jarosław Gowin, Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Science and Higher Education, quoted in the communication.
The head of the Ministry of Science points out that the money for innovations not only goes to innovators in the form of project funding, but also remains in their pockets – three quarters more entrepreneurs benefited from the R&D rebate in 2018 than a year earlier.
"The amount of deducted costs for R&D activities amounted to PLN 1.7 billion, which gave more than PLN 300 million in savings for companies benefiting from this rebate.
This is the equivalent of the support provided by NCBR in three editions of GameINN”, stresses the Deputy Prime Minister.
NCBR Director Wojciech Kamieniecki, PhD, reminds that in two previous competitions, 78 innovative projects worth a total of over PLN 211.2 million were awarded.
The great interest in the 3rd competition and the variety of applications show that the video game industry has ideas and competences to further develop and increase its competitive advantages.
“I am particularly pleased that among the projects selected – as in previous editions – there are projects concerning solutions not only for entertainment, but also related to Industry 4.0”, he adds.
In the third GameINN competition, entrepreneurs, a consortium of entrepreneurs and a consortium of entrepreneurs with scientific units could apply for funding of up to PLN 20 million.
87 applications for a total amount of PLN 317 million were submitted to NCBR.
The budget of the competition at the time of the announcement was PLN 100 million, but it was increased, so that 27 projects were awarded almost PLN 105 million in co-financing.
Detailed information about the results of GameINN III competition is available on the website ncbr.gov.pl.
The GameINN sector programme is implemented within the Intelligent Development Operational Programme.
NCBR launched the program in 2016 in response to an initiative of entrepreneurs associated in the Polish Games Alliance, which includes companies such as CD Projekt, Techland, CI Games, Bloober Team and 11 bit studios.
Lamine Diaby-Fadiga confessed to stealing the watch of Kasper Dolberg
The event occurred on September 16.
Dolberg, who had been transferred to Nice from Ajax in late August, found out after training that his watch had disappeared from the locker room.
It is worth 70 000 euros.
The next day, the angry Danish boy did not show up for class, explaining his stomach problems.
The matter was mysterious from the beginning.
The players in the dressing room have private safes and the club ground is monitored.
According to the AFP, Diaby-Fadiga eventually confessed to the theft.
At the age of 18, he apologized to Dolberg and other teammates and coach Patrick Vieira.
He also promised to pay the Danish for the watch.
Diaby-Fadiga is one of the most promising young footballers in France.
He moved to Nice at the age of 13 to make his debut in the first team three years later.
He played in seven games this season.
He has recently signed a professional contract, but as reported by the L'Equipe newspaper, the club is likely to terminate him with immediate effect.
He has since started disciplinary proceedings against his team.
Nice, at least officially, refuses to comment on this matter.
Make sure you wash your hands well
We all know that you have to wash them (e.g. after coming home or before a meal).
But not everyone knows that to actually get rid of germs, you need to do it in the right way.
This is especially important now that autumn infections are approaching.
It takes at least 30–40 seconds to wash away dangerous bacteria and viruses from your hands
And most of us wash them shorter!
Just warm water and ordinary soap – it is not true that it must be antibacterial (many doctors even reject it).
When washing, we rub not only the bottoms and tops of the hands, but also: fingertips (joined or alone) – rub them with circular movements on the inside of the other hand, spaces between the fingers (swipe hands, rubbing the fingers together), thumbs – each thumb we cover with the other hand and in such an embrace we turn it for a while to the right and left.
In an emergency situation (when you can't wash your hands) you should wipe your hands with a wet cloth, and then use antibacterial gel (in pharmacies, from 5 PLN).
When using the public toilet, do not touch the handles or doors with washed hands (recommendation of the Main Sanitary Inspectorate).
Open them with a paper towel.
Iranian President says he rejected the proposal for talks with the US, Donald Trump denies
Tehran did not enter into talks with the American side during the UN General Assembly in New York, despite the offer of the Americans to lift the sanctions – said Iranian President Hasan Rowhani on Friday.
President Donald Trump said that the Iranian side had asked for the ban to be lifted, but he did not agree.
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said that the United States had proposed to lift all sanctions against Tehran in exchange for negotiating a new international agreement.
It would regulate both Iran's nuclear program and its ballistic missile program.
Rowhani: Iran will not enter talks under maximum pressure
The Iranian President said he did not agree to the talks because of the "toxic atmosphere".
He was also a member of the United States delegation to the United Nations, where he met with the representatives of France, Germany and the United Kingdom.
He said that Iran would not enter into talks under "maximum pressure".
"Even if we want to negotiate with the Americans in the 5+1 format, no one can predict what the final outcome will be," Rowhani said.
The day before, the Iranian leader said that he was not excluding talks with the US, and he accused the European parties of promoting US sanctions on Iran.
He added that sanctions imposed on Iran after the US withdrawal from the nuclear deal "are a precondition that does not allow" for dialogue.
If we can remove this precondition and if America lifts the sanctions and maximum pressure, then of course we can talk to America," he declared.
He added that he would not rule out meeting with US President Donald Trump, even though he did not agree to such a meeting during the UN General Assembly this week.
Trump: “Iran asked, I said no”
Donald Trump has said on Twitter that he has rejected the Iranian side's request.
"Iran wanted me to lift the sanctions on them so that we could meet.
Of course I said 'no!' tweeted the US President.
Nuclear tension in the background
France, Germany and the United Kingdom are trying to ease tensions between Washington and Tehran in order to somehow salvage the 2015 agreement with Iran to which they were signatories.
The Iranian government has announced that it will abandon its nuclear weapons program and place the nuclear sector under the control of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
Since the US withdrew from the agreement in May 2015, the remaining signatories have repeatedly confirmed their willingness to keep the agreement in force.
So far, none of this has worked.
Washington is using a maximum pressure tactics on Iran, and sanctions also include a full embargo on Iranian oil.
Tehran has announced that if it does not receive a permit to export raw materials, it will limit its commitments under the agreement every 60 days.

The judge of the Provincial Administrative Court in Warsaw and the husband of the headmistress Emilia, who – according to her words and screens from WhatsApp – participated in stalking against the judges, was returned to the NSA on Wednesday.
The reason: disciplinary proceedings have not been initiated against him, and therefore there is no basis to uphold the order of the President of the WSA Wojciech Mazur to remove him from his duties.
Judge Jerzy Chromicki, the disciplinary spokesman for the NSA, initiated an investigation against Szmydt in late August, but it has not yet turned into an investigation against him.
Although the NSA, which acts as a disciplinary court in such cases, must deal with the decision of the WSA president within one month of its issuance.
In this situation, a judge who publicly talked about his wife's mental problems in order to discredit her, who was removed from the office of the KRS because of suspicion of participation in the group of the general, will return to the court and will give judgments on behalf of the Republic of Poland.
Judge Schmydt denies his participation in the group.
He claims that there is no evidence for this except for fake screens and the words of his wife, with whom he is divorced.
The other judges associated with the “Caste” claim exactly the same: all are innocent, there is no evidence.
And quite possibly they will decide on their own.
Because the prosecutor's office did not raise a finger to secure evidence from their electronic media, it is also silent about the contents of Emilie Szmydt's phone, which it stopped in June in another case.
The police did not move a finger to secure the devices of the people whom judge Waldemar Żurek identified as persecutors in the February report.
There is no evidence – there is no Szmydt case, there is no “Kasty” case.
Nor is there a case of the head of the NIK, Marian Banasia, about renting the tenement house to tenants and hiding the income.
The CBA checks his financial statements.
And he will check when he checks.
The Committee on Parliamentary Ethics will not deal with Banas, because the Sejm is suspended (but the Committee on State Control somehow gathered to take a curious decision on the dismissal of Banas' deputies and appointment as his attorney-at-law, although the law does not provide for such a strange combination).
The whole thing reminds me of a movie novella, American novella, about a wife coming home and finding her husband with his mistress in bed.
She is so amazed and overwhelmed that she cannot utter a word.
She is standing in the doorway, naked, and at the same time her lover quickly jumps out of bed, dresses and leaves.
And the husband washed the bed.
When the wife regains her voice and shouts: what is this?
Who is this woman?
My husband calmly asks: what woman, my dear?
Only that in the case of “Kasta” or Banasia it is a parody of the state.
And that is not funny at all.

Kamila Litvinko in the high jump final
The 2017 World Championships bronze medalist from London, who had previously returned to the competition after her mother's break, beat 1.85 and 1.89 in the first attempt and 1.92 in the second.
It was only possible to reach 1.94 in the third approach.
“I am glad.
I showed that I could fight, because the first attempt was completely unsuccessful.
In the final I will have to jump better technically”, admitted Lićwinko in front of the camera of Eurosport.
The best two finalists were Vashti Cunningham of the United States and Karyna Demidik of Belarus, with a total of 1.94 points each.
Both players were the only ones not to score any points.
The women's final was scheduled for Monday.
Start at 7:30 pm Polish time.
Kornel Morawiecki is in a critical condition in hospital
He was taken to the hospital and his condition was described by doctors as severe.
He is conscious and aware.
“We believe that it will come out that he will win again.
We all pray that he will get back to health,” said an anonymous close person Kornel Morawiecki in an interview with journalists of the Super Express.
In the upcoming elections, the Prime Minister's father is running for the Senate.
“I am kept alive by my closest family and politicians,” Kornel Morawiecki said in an interview he gave to the journalists of Super Express two weeks ago.
In January, Super Express reported that Kornel Morawiecki, 78, had been sent to the Military Hospital in Wrocław for medical examinations.
“I had strange, disturbing symptoms and went to the hospital.
It turned out that I had yellow fever.
But the worst was in front of me.
When a CT scan was performed, it was found that I had pancreatic cancer...”, the Prime Minister’s father said.
A few days later, Kornel Morawiecki underwent a serious operation at the MSWiA hospital in Warsaw.
As Morawiecki said, President Andrzej Duda sent his personal chaplain, priest Zbigniew Kras, to the hospital.
The operation lasted about three hours and was successful.
“I know that many people prayed for me, for which I thank them very much.
Fortunately, I have no metastases.
I don't know yet if I will undergo chemotherapy.
I give myself into the hands of specialist doctors who are rather good-natured.
For now, after this heavy operation, I have to return to some state of usability.
I hope that everything will be fine,” Kornel Morawiecki said in January in an interview with SE.
"If I gave up the study too late, the situation would be tragic and I would say goodbye to this doll...", he added.
Kraków: 14 year old girl is missing

Anyone who has any information about the missing persons is asked to contact us.
She was found missing on 26 September and has not returned to her home or contacted her family.
It was first seen in the Old Town of Kraków.
Nel Stokłosa is 14 years old, 167 cm tall, has blonde hair and grey-blue eyes.
When she was last seen, she was dressed in a sweatshirt, grey trousers and shoes.
Anyone with any information about the missing persons is asked to contact the police at 12 61-52-911, 12 61-53-616 or 112, 997.
The power of the Oława jumps.
The title of the report from the amateur sports competitions, held on Sunday afternoon 15 September at the racetrack at Oleander Street in Oława, may be misleading for some.
The real power is a long way away, but that is the name of one of the types of horse racing...
The competition for jumping power consists of the rider and horse overcoming increasingly higher obstacles, which in the most prestigious international competitions exceed even two meters.
It is worth adding here that the long-term and still unbeaten world record, set in 1949, by the Chilean Albert Larraguibel, on horse "Huaso", is 247 cm.
Of course nobody jumped so high in Oława, but the result of the best local amateurs at 135 cm is not the worst either...
The competitions organized by tireless Jan Sienkiewicz and other activists of JKS "In the saddle" were a demonstration part of the "Ride Equestrian Competitions" that were held there a little earlier, about which we write more in this issue of the newspaper, on page 22.
Eight teams competed in the competition, including the UCI Equestrian World Cup.
Four were on horseback and four on large horses.
In the first group Nikola Szołdra, who reached the crazy "Sprinter", performed best.
This small but dynamic rumak started from overcoming obstacles spread at a height of 40 cm, and ended only at the station with the top beam 125 cm away from the ground.
He was not able to compete and was subsequently disqualified by the competition.
The second place in the jumps of ponies was taken by Amelia Pawlak, reaching "Famy", and the third Lena Boruń on "Harmider".
The youngest participant of the tournament - Inga Aksman, galloping and jumping through obstacles on the small mare "Carmen" competed ambitiously.
Even more emotions accompanied the amateurs and spectators during the competition with large horses.
The most dangerous-looking falls included Paulina Szewczyk, who was making a "Declaration", and Anastazja Abramenko, who was riding a "Flight".
Fortunately, apart from minor bruises, neither the amazons nor the horses were hurt, so they continued to participate in the competition.
Weronika Łuczkiewicz had a lot of problems with introducing the young mare “Wineta” to the park.
It was necessary either an assistant trainer, or another horse for the pair, behind which a little crazy "Wineta" was hiding.
After the obstacle from the parking lot was counted, she also skied full length, so for a few moments it was dangerous in the pits and in the distribution room. “Everything is under control!”, Jan Sienkiewicz reassuring a little bit the frightened spectators, especially the youngest ones.
Since the beginning of the competition for large horses Marta Masalska was doing well on the parking lot, getting a beautifully presented “Whisky”.
This worthy mare, together with an experienced amateur, jumped 135 cm in the second approach in the final stage and it was the best result of the competition at that moment.
After a while, however, the same height was also included by Paulina Szewczyk on "Declaration", Weronika Łuczkiewicz on "Winet" and Anastazja Abramenko on "Flight".
So all these competitors went out to decorate the flo and after receiving the prizes in the form of equestrian equipment, and at the end together with the amateurs on ponies in the Radecki march they performed an impressive honorary round, ending these interesting and exciting competitions.

Max Kolonko is cut off from KWW The Patriotic Revolution of Max Kolonko
KWW Patriotyczna Rewolucja Maxa Kolonko is the name of the electoral committee under which the political formation #R Revolution of Mariusz Maxa Kolonko was to go to the October parliamentary elections.
The revolution was aimed especially at young voters with right-wing views.
Before the elections, Kolonko announced his collaboration with Marek Jakubiak or Paweł Kukisz, but neither coalition was formed, and KWW Patriotyczna Rewolucja Maxa Kolonko himself was unable to collect enough signatures to put up lists in any constituency in Poland.
Now Kolonko announced on Twitter that he has ended his collaboration with KWW Patriotic Revolution Max Kolonko.
"I will wait for the above mentioned KWW to delete my name from the name.
I kindly ask you not to associate my person with the above mentioned entity”, he added and announced that he will provide more information soon.
It is not known whether the journalist will continue his activities or whether it will be the end of #R Rewolucja.
On July 4, the American Independence Day, journalist Mariusz Max Kolonko, who is in the USA, announced the formation of a new political formation - #R Revolution.
In recent years, Kolonko has become famous for running the Max TV channel on YouTube, where he comments on events in Poland and around the world.
“We have enough politicians, enough of your hard-core fools, enough of your amateur governments.
It is time for the nation to take over the power in the state and to govern for the good of the nation,” Kolonko said.
The party's program included issues related to the judiciary (should be elected in general elections), tax changes (equalization of the tax-free amount for all), war reparations (in the form of military aid for the eastern NATO flanks, with special emphasis on Poland), holding a referendum on the possession of weapons, limiting the number of deputies or introducing single-member constituencies.
A few days after the announcement of the formation of a new political formation, Mariusz Max Kolonko began talks with Marek Jakubiak.
In late July, Kolonko posted on his social media profile information suggesting that #R would join forces with the Kukiz'15 movement.
However, none of these coalitions ultimately came to fruition.
UBS: Gold close to the equilibrium
“The euro will remain around PLN 4.35 in the coming months, which will be accompanied by weak conditions on global markets,” says Michael Bolliger of UBS Wealth Management.
“The expectations of maintaining a solid economic growth rate and a stable monetary policy speak in favour of stabilising the gold prices at the current level,” the specialist in an interview with Bankier.pl estimates.
In his opinion, despite the clear inflationary pressure, the Monetary Policy Council will not decide on rate increases in an environment where the vast majority of central banks are relaxing their policies.
"If the zloty is properly valued – the euro should remain in the range of PLN 4.35 in the coming months – Polish bonds are not attractive enough.
The emerging markets bonds offer significantly higher returns than Polish securities,” says Michael Bolliger, head of asset allocation for emerging markets at UBS Wealth Management.
According to the expert, the main threat to the Polish economy is the deterioration of the global economic situation.
“The global slowdown may deepen, but there should be no severe recession, and at most no fall in GDP growth below zero,” says Michael Bolliger.
"Investors should not underestimate global stocks, which may be damaged by the lack of prospects for resolving the US-China trade conflict and other geopolitical risk factors, including the Trump impeachment procedure and Brexit.
Europe should be the relatively weakest of the stock markets,” according to the latest investor letter from UBS Wealth Management CEO Mark Haefele.
"The actions of the euro area countries should behave worse than the Americans, because they are more vulnerable in the conditions of increased uncertainty around global trade and fears of slowdown", reads the document.
According to Michael Bolliger, after the hossa on the bond markets of the safest countries pushed the profitability of German 10-year bonds even down to minus 0.74 percent, it is still possible to deepen the decline in profitability.
However, in the long term, the profitability of long-term securities should no longer fall, but only of short-term securities, thanks to the easing of banks' monetary policy.
The Fed has the largest scope for rate cuts, which should weaken the US currency in the coming years.
The long-term equilibrium for the euro is the USD 1.29 ceiling, which would mean a 19-percent potential for strengthening the common currency against the dollar.
We expect further Fed rate cuts, which will result in a narrowing of the monetary policy gap in the world.
“The current account and budget deficits may not allow the dollar to maintain its strength in the long term,” says Michael Bolliger.
The Bundeswehr loses its weapons.
Confidential report of the German intelligence service
In early 2014, the Bundeswehr reported the disappearance of 39 weapons, 39 parts of weapons and 19,445 pieces of ammunition, according to a confidential report compiled by the German Defence Forces.
The information was provided by the press belonging to the editorial network Deutschland (RND).
According to a document from the office of the parliamentary secretary of state in the MON Peter Tauber (CDU), so far it has been possible to re-measure two pieces of weapons, one part of weapons and 3474 pieces of ammunition.
Among the military equipment that is still missing are six MG3 machine guns, 11 G3 automatic rifles, four G36 automatic rifles, six signal pistols and two P8 pistols.
There are also 30 MG3 machine gun barrels missing.
The situation was expressed by the vice-president of the Left Party, Martina Renner.
According to the RND, the number of missing weapons and ammunition is "surprising".
The investigations revealed that only a small part of the equipment was lost.
Martin Renner summarized the effects of these actions as a "poor balance sheet".
In December 2017, the Federal Prosecutor's Office in Karlsruhe charged him with preparing a serious act of violence threatening state security and violating the law on access to firearms.
The officer was accused of preparing attacks on leading German politicians for far-right and racist motives.
His "blacklist" of targets, which fell into the hands of the prosecutor's office, included the then Minister of Justice Heiko Maas of the SPD, Claudia Roth of the Green Party and Anetta Kahane, a human rights defender and founder of the Amadeu Antonio Stiftung in Berlin.
Franco A. illegally possessed four firearms, over 1,000 ammunition and over 50 explosive charges.
Children crying in the plane.
How to avoid them?
There is a Solution
Japan Airlines has recently introduced a feature designed for people who find travelling with a crying child a nightmare.
The airline's website allows you to check the seating arrangements on the aircraft.
If a child is travelling on a given connection until the age of two, the “child icon” appears on a specific seat reserved by the parents or guardians.
Thus, the person using the carrier's services has the possibility to choose a place far from the place occupied by the toddler.
The BBC reported that the line had already reported the imperfections of this solution.
The “Child icon” will not appear if the ticket was booked by a third party or if the flight was changed at the last minute.
As expected, the idea was shared by Internet users.
Some Twitter users suggest that the problem of traveling with crying children can be solved with noise-reducing headphones.
They are children, we were children once.
“We need to learn tolerance, because we will soon need maps of sitting places for mouth-breathing, drooling or drunken people,” wrote user G Sundar.
Another student noticed that he was once disturbed by crying children on an airplane, but changed his mind when he became a parent.
Nor are there any supporters of the solution introduced by Japan Airlines.
“Thank you for warning me about screaming children during my 13-hour journey,” Rahat Ahmed wrote.
Majorca counts losses after the bankruptcy of travel agency Thomas Cook
More than 25,000 foreign tourists will not come to Mallorca in October as a result of the bankruptcy announced on Monday by the travel agency Thomas Cook.
As the representative of the autonomous government of the Balearic Islands Marc Pons informed on Friday, among the 25,000 holidaymakers who will not be able to take advantage of the October holiday in Majorca, there are also people who were to travel with companies indirectly associated with Thomas Cook, such as Neckermann.
Pons explained that 80% of the expected holidaymakers who had to give up their holidays in Majorca next month due to the bankruptcy of the British company are citizens of Germany and Scandinavian countries.
However, Pons says that since Thomas Cook did not direct tourists to the Balearic Islands during the period November-April, the losses to the local economy will be smaller.
He revealed that the Balearic government had already started negotiations with international operators on "entering the market of Majorca" after the bankruptcy of the British operator.
According to the estimates of the newspaper "Diario de Mallorca" it is estimated that in October due to the tourist crisis in Majorca will lose more than 1000 people their jobs.
About 800 are dismissed employees of Thomas Cook's office in Palm.
Others will lose their jobs mainly in the hotel sector.
On Monday, with the bankruptcy of Thomas Cook, property owners in many hotels in Majorca demanded additional charges for accommodation.
This situation was experienced by several dozen tourists from Poland.
The Balearic Government estimates that by Thursday dozens of hotels in Majorca had ceased operations by the end of October at least, following the bankruptcy of Thomas Cook and his associates.
On Friday, the Diario de Ibiza newspaper reported that most of the hotels in Ibiza that worked with Thomas Cook were not planning to close in the coming weeks.
The newspaper reminds that on this Balearic island the British bankrupt cooperated with 42 hotels.
On Wednesday, the autonomous Balearic authorities announced that they would ask the Spanish government for 100 million euros in support of the region to cover the losses caused by the bankruptcy of Thomas Cook's travel agency.
The most affected tourists in the archipelago, about 36,000 people, are in Majorca.
According to the Balearic Government, Thomas Cook is responsible for the implementation of contracts for the period July-September 2019 for local tourism companies, mainly hotel operators, with around €5 million.
FIFA Women's Rankings.
Poland still in 29th place, USA in the lead
The women's national football team of Poland is ranked 29th in the FIFA rankings published on Friday.
The team of coach Miłosz Stępiński was ranked in the previous, July ranking.
Weak team matches.
How will it be in October?
The Americans are the only women to have won the World Championships.
The Germans finished second and the Dutch third.
The Polish team is preparing for the qualification.
Their first match was against the Czech Republic on 3 September.
The day before the meeting, it was postponed by a year due to food poisoning of the opponents.
In this situation, the Polish team will open the qualifications with a meeting with the Spanish team on 12 November in Lublin.
The Whites played two friendly matches on 3 October, one against Cyprus and the other against Brazil in Kielce.
The group of rivals of the Polish team are the representatives of Spain, the Czech Republic, Azerbaijan and Moldova.
The group winners and the top three teams from the second place advance directly to the final tournament.
The remaining six teams from the second tier will play in the final three stages of the European Championship.
The host – England – will complete the 16 participants.
The Polish national football team in the FIFA World Rankings fell from 20th to 22nd place.
“Rz”: Smoke has crushed the government
“The effects of the Clean Air Programme are minimal, and coal-fired ovens will dig this winter as if nothing ever happened”, we read on the front page of today’s Rzeczpospolita.
"So far, 82 thousand applications for funding worth PLN 2 billion have been submitted under the Clean Air Programme, of which 48 thousand decisions were positive.
The approved proposals amount to a total of more than PLN 915 million," says the 'Rz', citing data from the spokesman for the Minister of the Environment.
As the newspaper points out, only a part of the costs incurred are reimbursed from the program.
The results of the announced noise program the daily assesses as "small".
The government, cited by the Rz, sees the defeats of the Clean Air, among others, in too much bureaucracy.
“The program should be much simpler: electronic submission, sending invoices by post, possible random control of implementation.
This would improve the operations”, believes the mayor of Lidzbarka Warmiński Jacek Wiśniowski.
Activists from the Polish Smoke Alarm noted that in the first year of operations less than 1% of the established target of 3 million excavating boilers was achieved.
As the "Rz" notes, although the budget of the programme is PLN 103 billion for 10 years, i.e. PLN 10 billion per year, this amount is virtual.
“The budget of the National Fund for Environmental Protection and Water Management for this year has been booked at once PLN 1.4 billion”, we read.
Congress agrees on F-35 for Poland
Błaszczak: Now price negotiations
The United States Congress approved the sale of 32 of the most modern F-35 aircraft to Poland.
“This is one of the last steps before concluding the contract, but not the end of our work,” Mariusz Błaszczak wrote on Twitter.
“We will negotiate hard to achieve the best price,” added the Polish minister.
Polish F-35 contract
The Polish Air Force is to be supplied with 32 F-35 Lightning II fighters manufactured by Lockheed Martin.
In mid-September, the US Department of State agreed to sell them to Poland.
The Communication stressed that the investment will support US national security and foreign policy by improving the security of NATO, which is an important force for political stability in Europe.
According to the State Department, Poland is to pay $6.5 billion for the fighters.
However, this is not the final price.
The State Department noted that the contract will also include the supply of spare parts and repairs, training equipment, engineering, logistics and human resources services, as well as related logistics and program support elements and personnel training.
Lockheed Martin F-35 fighters
The Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II is a single-seat, single-engine, multi-role, fifth-generation fighter aircraft.
The aircraft is capable of close support missions, bombing and typically fighter air combat.
Thanks to stealth technology, the fighter is undetectable to near-range radars.
The F-35 was recently purchased by Belgium under a contract worth $4.55 billion.
The Belgian Air Force is currently replacing the F-16.
The United States also has a number of other aircraft manufacturers, including the United States Air Force, the United States Air Force, and the United States Navy.
Barbie against stereotypes.
Gender dolls
Barbie has launched a series of gender-neutral dolls.
He wants to fight stereotypes in this way.
Barbie producer launches a series of gender-neutral dolls
In addition to Barbie with different skin color, figure or hairstyle, Mattel has introduced gender neutral dolls.
The "Creatable World" series of toys wear wigs.
Children can therefore decide whether their Barbie should have short hair or long.
Their wardrobe consists of both trousers and dresses.
In a flash, dolls can become boys from girls and vice versa.
They are also available in different skin colours and with different clothes.
The characteristic gender features were also dropped – gender dolls no longer have full mouths, long eyelashes and a slim waist or – in the case of Ken – wide arms.
The company believes that children do not like their dolls to have gender norms imposed on them, and some parents and feminists believe that toys made with gender in mind inhibit girls' ambitions and reinforce traditional stereotypes.
“The new dolls will allow all children to feel free,” says Mattel.
Barbie, which appeared on the market in 1959 in a swimsuit and high heels, has been criticized for promoting "unhealthy female stereotypes", such as unnatural body proportions.
The company responded to criticism and has already introduced dolls with different skin colours and more rounded shapes.
There are also some dolls in the Hijab.
Zandberg: a circle or club A circle or club can have several members
When asked on ZET radio how many candidates of his party could get into the Sejm from lists of left-wing groups (KW SLD, from which list the candidates for the Sejm SLD, Spring and Left Together, starting with the joint logo "Left"), Zandberg replied that it depends on the result of the committee.
“I believe that the Left’s result will be very good, because we feel that people are hoping that the Left is not only right, but also strong,” he said.
According to Zandberg, the left may have 60–80 members.
“This may mean that the circle or club will have a dozen members.
But it depends on Poles.
I will not guess and say how it will happen”, he said.
Asked if the Left Together would have a separate circle, Zandberg replied, "We are agreed that we are diverse, and we will not pretend that there is no such diversity.
I think that this diversity was rewarded by Poles, because we showed that we were able to agree on a common program while differing.”
When asked whether the biggest beneficiary of the joint start is the leader of the SLD, Vladimir Czarzasty, Zandberg replied that in his opinion the biggest beneficiaries are the centre-left and left-wing voters.
He said that the SLD would receive the entire subsidy, but denied that "the aim of a political party is to represent its voters".
Zandberg admitted that he would vote for himself in the elections to the Sejm.
In the case of the elections to the Senate he pointed out that he was wondering.
“The offer is diverse and there are candidates to whom my heart is closer, but there are also those to whom my heart is further away,” he said.
"I will tell you very honestly and clearly that if I were in the seat of the 44th Senate, I would take the election certificate and vote in another seat," the politician emphasized.
“I would not dare to vote for Minister Kazimierz Ujazdowski (the candidate of the KO – PAP)”, he added.
In this district outside Ujazdowskim, the leader of the Citizens of the Republic of Poland Paweł Kasprzak and Marek Rudnicki from the PiS are competing.
Dakar: The largest mosque in West Africa opens
Tens of thousands of people from all over Senegal gathered in the capital on Friday to inaugurate a huge mosque, considered the largest in West Africa.
The Muslims arrived by bus, car and on foot to the Bopp district, where a new mosque was built, which could accommodate 30,000 worshippers.
The mosque was built by the Mouride brotherhood, a member of the Sufi Islamic movement that dominates Senegal.
The mosque was built ten years ago on a six-hectare wetlands site donated by the government.
The name of the mosque is derived from the poem by Sheikh Ahmadou Bamba Mbacke, the founder of the nineteenth-century brotherhood, which is venerated as a saint by the faithful.
The mosque is covered with Carrara marble and has five minarets.
The highest of these is 78 metres.
The mosque in the middle will accommodate 15,000 believers, and the other so much can stay on the outside esplanade.
In the richly finished interiors you can admire the gilded dome, giant chandeliers and decorations handmade by Moroccan workers.
The construction team claims that the mosque is the largest in West Africa, but the building is still unlike mosques in other regions.
In Morocco, Hassan II Mosque in Casablanca can accommodate 105,000 worshippers.
The construction of the mosque, which cost over 30 million euros, was financed by private donations.
The government, in addition to the land, funded lighting, sanitation and road works worth 10.5 million euros.
Coach Smyła: Our problem is not Silesia, only ourselves
The club's eight league matches without a win will be interrupted on Friday by a match against the Śląski Ekstraklasa club.
“Our problem is not wroclaw, only we ourselves, we have to work on what we play”, stressed coach of Kielce Mirosław Smyła.
The last and so far only winners of the league were the first-row players of Korona, who beat the Beniaminsk team of Raków Częstochowa 1–0.
The team then lost two draws and six draws, and on Tuesday lost 0–1 to Zagłębie Lubin in the Polish Cup final.
“I am optimistic that in the last seconds of the cup match the players fought for the goal, they wanted to draw.
Their fall on the wall after the last whistle was not the result of a break, but the fall of anger, because they were so close,” Smyła said.
As he pointed out, Silesia has very strong wings, so he will be sensitive to the team playing in the side sectors of the field.
“We are aware of the quality of the opponent, but we also look at what we want to play,” added the coach.
In Friday's match in Korona, Ognjen Gnjatic will not play for the rest for the excess of yellow cards, in the squad will also be missing injured Jakub Żubrowski and Michael Gardawskiego.
The goal is to get a few players to play in the match.
“We have a headache, recently it seemed that it would not be, and now it is,” Smyła said.
Crown defender Daniel Dziwniel stressed that Silesia will not be an easy rival to break the pass of eight league matches in a row without a victory, while in the extra-league everyone can win with everyone.
“We are a good team.
In recent weeks we may not show it on the pitch, but there will come a moment when we will win and we believe that it will be on Friday”, the footballer said.
After nine consecutive seasons in the top flight, the club finished 15th with five points.
The team finished 12th and finished in second place.
Friday's match in Kielce will start at 20.30.
These trees can disappear completely from Europe
“42% of the species of trees that make up Europe’s forests are at risk,” warns the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) in its Red Book of European Trees published on Friday.
The list includes the following: Cattle and Horses.
The IUCN, based in Gland, Switzerland, is publishing the list of endangered species of European trees for the first time.
It was compiled by specialists who based their research on the findings that out of 454 species of trees found in Europe (and other parts of the world) 42% are "highly endangered".
Among the causes, the Red Book mentions the rapid growth of urban agglomerations and global climate change.
However, the most threatened are those trees and shrubs that occur only or mainly on our continent.
As for the typical European tree stand, according to IUCN experts, 58% of species are at risk and 15%, i.e. 66 species of trees and shrubs, are threatened with extinction.
Among the main causes of deforestation, the Red Book lists errors in the exploitation of forests, accelerated urbanisation, excessive tree felling, and then forest fires and changes in the European ecosystem.
The authors of the report also believe that the existence of many European shrubs, mosses and stands is under serious threat.
"The consequences of human activities are leading to the gradual extinction of European plant species and are threatening to extinguish important and undervalued varieties in Europe, which form the basis of European ecosystems and affect the health of our planet", concluded Luc Bas, who heads the European IUCN office.
Grzegorz Schetyna: I do not promise 600+
"Today the PiS wants to buy the Poles, offering them for freedom a distribution on credit, which will have to be paid by future generations," Grzegorz Schetyna says in an interview for Rzeczpospolita.
"The whole politics of the PiS is a pic".
The policy also states that "what is given will not be taken away".
Schetyna assures Jackie Nizinkiewicz that he has an idea to overcome the Law and Justice.
It is about mobilising the electorate at the ballot box.
In his opinion, the opposition has more potential in this area than Kaczyński's party.
“Today, there are more conscious people who want to live in a normal state than supporters of the PiS, a party that has been predestined to proclaimed values such as modesty, humility, transparency,” Schetyna says.
The leader of the Civic Coalition and the chairman of the Civic Platform also outlined the basic principles of the electoral programme of the Coalition.
“Firstly, nothing that is given will be received, but we must set the direction for the future, because the Law and Justice Party deals exclusively with the situation here and now, there is no plan for Poland, which can be seen even after dramatically low investments,” he said.
Secondly, it is about “starting up the energy of Poles, helping and investing in those who work reliably – and those who are entrepreneurs”.
Schetyna explains that the KO program includes a project that will give the least-earning Poles more than 614 zlotys per hand, and more earners – also several hundreds.
The politician also said that he did not want to pursue the distribution.
He said he would do as much as he could, but he did not promise 600+.
“I will never allow the Greek option, where the government negotiated with the opposition for distribution until the country’s financial collapse,” he stressed.
Schetyna also stated in an interview for the Rz that Jarosław Kaczyński and Mateusz Morawiecki were afraid to debate with him and Margareta Kidawa-Błońska.
"We would expose their hypocrisy and propaganda," he said.
“The push is moving before the fall.
Kaczyński is a statesman like Banas is crystal,” he added.
The leader of the Civic Platform also said that he has not yet decided whether he will apply for the chairmanship of the Platform.
Argentina: Six Dead Great Condors
Six dead great condors have been found in the Argentine province of Santa Cruz, reports TVN24.
The experts believe that human activity contributed to their deaths.
The great condors were probably poisoned with a means to kill predators such as cougars, foxes, and wild dogs.
Animals may have eaten the poison.
In addition to one young, the remaining condors were adult.
"This is a huge loss to the environment, because the condor must take 10-15 years to become fertile and capable of reproduction.
So we are losing a protected species, a endangered species,” says Luis Jacome, director of the BioAndina Foundation, an Argentine environmental organization.
“I think that the use of toxic bait and poison puts not only this species at risk, but all other life forms, including human health,” he adds.
“Rz”: They want a jewel for the president
Work has begun on awarding the head of state a valuable chain.
The idea was supported by the office of Andrzej Duda – we read in "Rzeczpospolita".
As the newspaper explains, it is a gold chain of the Order of the White Eagle, a royal insignia officially called in the interwar period a jewel of the Republic.
It was probably used by President Ignacy Mościcki.
"Rz" states that soon such a chain may hit Andrzej Duda's shoulders.
The Senate Committee on Human Rights, Rule of Law and Petitions voted on Wednesday to initiate work on an amendment to the Act on Orders and Decorations in order to restore it.
The newspaper writes that this is not the first attempt to restore this chain to the head of state.
The Senate had already proposed such an amendment in 1992, but it fell by one vote.
This time the work is instantaneous.
In early August, the senators devoted a few minutes to the matter, considering that they would seek the opinion of the President's Chancellery.
It was completed in mid-September.
“I would like to inform you that the Chancellery of the President of the Republic of Poland does not comment on the position presented in this petition,” wrote the President’s Minister Andrzej Dera.
On Wednesday, the Senate committee continued the case and devoted little time to it again.
“The President’s office has briefly replied to us: it is in favour of restoring it,” said the head of the commission Robert Mamątow from the PiS, quoted by the “Rz”.
He submitted a proposal for legislative work, which the committee supported.
Police will teach drivers how to drive through the intersection
The police action will be conducted, among others, at the crossing of Ciepliński Avenue and Piłsudski Avenue.
The uniform actions are somehow related to recent complaints by the city authorities about drivers not always being able to behave properly at the crossing.
On Friday, 27 September, policemen in Rzeszow begin the prevention activities “Transit crossings”.
It is about eliminating traffic constraints: entering the crossing without being able to get off, not using traffic lights or road signs.
“We often think that we are alone at the crossroads and we are actually making life difficult for other drivers,” said Marek Ustrobiński, vice president of the city, a few days ago.
His words were heard at a press conference of the town hall, where the city authorities presented examples of inappropriate car movement at intersections, which resulted in traffic jams.
The president then appealed to travellers for common sense on the road and, among other things, faster driving at the lights or not writing SMS while driving.
The topic was taken over by the policemen from rzeszów, who are starting the action “Transit Crossings” from today.
What is the point?
The aim of the measures is to eliminate the phenomenon of restricting the crossing of roads by drivers entering them without the possibility of continuing driving.
This is a common offence, which contributes to the increase of traffic congestion and the creation of traffic jams.
It is threatened with a warrant of 300 PLN and 2 penalty points.
In addition, the uniforms will pay attention to the non-compliance with traffic lights or signs and improper parking in the area of intersections.
They will also observe a lack of fluidity, late starts under signals, free crossings and leaving too much distance between vehicles.
What crossroads will be used?
Among others, on Lisa-Kula Street from Jagiellońska Street; Cieplińskiego Avenue from Piłsudski Avenue; Targowa Street from Piłsudski Avenue; Śreniawitów Square from Dąbrowskiego Street or Hetmańska Street from Warsaw Uprising Avenue.
This type of action in the capital of Podkarpackie will be held in the next Fridays of October.
They inspected the company that disposes of waste from “Czajka”
“On Friday, officials of the Department of Environmental Protection of the Old Town of the Wołomiński County and the District Inspectorate of Building Supervision inspected a plant in Zielonka, where waste from the sewage treatment plant “Czajka” in Warsaw is disposed of,” informed Karol Szyszko, spokesman for the Wołomiński County Mayor.
The inspectors from the Wołomiński mayoral office carried out a check at the plant located in the forests belonging to the Zielonka municipality.
The private trading and transportation plant Dar-Trans, under the contract with the capital sewage treatment plant “Czajka”, performs the services of waste-water treatment.
"The installation was inspected, and the entrepreneur was asked to provide documentation related to his business," Szyszko said.
He added that the post-control report will be forwarded to the Voivodeship Environmental Protection Inspectorate in Warsaw.
The last inspection in Dar-Trans was carried out by the Voivodeship Inspectorate of Environmental Protection in Warsaw in the period from 29 December 2015 to 11 February 2016.
It was then established that the company did not perform sampling, measurements and tests of groundwater, and did not have the results of studies of stabilized municipal sewage sludge from the sewage treatment plant "Czajka".
After the inspection of the IOŚ, Dariusz Sobota was called upon to stop violating the conditions of the decision.
Private Trading and Transportation Plant “DAR-TRANS” Dariusz Sobota is one of the companies receiving waste in the form of stabilized municipal wastewater sludge from the “Czajka” treatment plant.
According to the decision to dispose of waste on the site, waste up to 60,000 tonnes per year is processed in the forests near Zielonka.
Warsaw Municipal Waterworks and Sewerage Company informed last Thursday that at the turn of November and December 2018 STUOŚ was decommissioned, which was related to the damage to one of the incineration plant's equipment.
As the MPWiK informed, the monthly cost of their export is PLN 1.7 million (calculated on the basis of export costs from 01.01.2019 to 31.08.2019).
Lech Wałęsa supported Margareta of Świętokrzyskie.
“You have undertaken a difficult task, you can count on my full support”, Lech Wałęsa said to Małgorzata Kidawy-Błońska on Friday.
“Mr. President, these are very important words for me”, answered the candidate of the Civic Coalition for Prime Minister, leader of the list of the Coalition for Democracy in Warsaw.
The former president stressed that as far as the situation in Poland is concerned, he is now “only a retired fan”.
Małgorzata Kidawa-Błońska met with former President Lech Wałęsa in his office at the European Solidarity Centre in Gdańsk on Friday.
In a short conversation behind closed doors also took part Wałęsa's son – Jarosław.
“You have undertaken a difficult task,” said Lech Wałęsa after the meeting.
“You can count on my full support,” he added.
“The problems facing Poland are known to all of us.
Therefore, it is a great hope that you as a woman will cope with these problems and we all – those who love Poland – will support your actions to the maximum”, said the former president, addressing the Kidawa-Błońska.
Very Important Words
The Polish delegation thanked the Polish delegation for their support.
“Mr President, these are very important words for me, because nobody like you can talk about freedom, about the constitution and knows how important it is”, she said.
“Let us show that we can make a different, wise policy, together, but in accordance with the constitution, in accordance with the law, in accordance with respect for others.
You did your revolution in this way, and we want to change Poland in this way,” said Kidawa-Błońska.
The Retired Fan
In a statement to the press, he said that he was "just a retired fan".
“Of course I look at it.
I hope that we will reverse the course of events, that what was good, tested, we will (go back to) it.
The three-tier system of power is the most important, the constitution is the most important, and the courts are essential.
And all of this has to be cleared up, all of this has to be brought back to normal, and I believe that this time we will do it.
Because if not, then we will have to meet the street criterion”, said Lech Wałęsa.
“That is why it is so important that Poles go to the elections, think about it and make their own decision.
And that is the most important thing”, admitted Kidawa-Błońska.
“The last chance that we will improve the situation in Poland with a card,” the former president replied.
“We must rebuild the foundations”
Asked about the most important changes that should take place in Poland, Kidawa-Błońska said: "The President said very well.
We need to rebuild the foundation on which we can do all the other things.
If the three-tier system of power does not exist, if the constitution is not respected, we must go back to the beginning and make it clear and let everyone know that otherwise Poland will not make a single step forward."
The match was a 3–1 draw between Poland and Slovenia in the semi-finals.
In the final, the Polish team faced the Slovenian team in the semi-finals of the European Championships.
There was no lack of controversy and discussions with the judges, with the Polish coach Vital Heynen in the lead role.
"White-Red" lost 1:3 and will play for the bronze medal.
Senate has decided on key laws
The Senate passed the Act on the Disclosure of the Estates of the Most Important State Officials and on the Flights of the Most Important Persons in the State without amendments.
The bill was approved by the House of Representatives with 52 votes in favour, 14 against and 3 abstentions.
The Senate voted to reject 12 amendments tabled during Wednesday's debate by Senator Sławomir Rybicki.
According to him, the amendments were to "civilize" the law and limit the scope of information given in the declaration on the financial situation of children of their own, spouse's children, children adopted in cases where children remain in the common household with the person obliged to submit the declaration.
The law on the transparency of the assets of the families of the most important state officials, which was drafted in the Prime Minister's office, was passed by the Sejm on 11 September.
The rules stipulate that, among others, the Prime Minister, ministers, MPs, MPs, senators, presidents of the Constitutional Court, the Supreme Administrative Court and the Supreme Court, as well as persons heading other state institutions, will be obliged to include in the property declaration information about the personal property of spouses, children and persons in common-law relationships.
The Senate also did not propose amendments to the Act on the Flight of the Most Important Persons in the State.
It regulates which flights have HEAD status and who can be on board government aircraft with the most important persons in the country.
The Act also specifies who is responsible for maintaining the Central Flight Register.
The bill was approved by 55 senators, 12 against, and four abstained.
According to the law, every flight of the President will be a flight "executed in an official mission".
The President will be able to be accompanied on flights by family members and other persons invited by the President.
The official mission of the Prime Minister and the Marshals of the Sejm and Senate will only be a flight "held for the purpose of carrying out tasks directly related to the function performed".
The law also specifies the list of persons who may accompany the most important persons in the country during the flight.
The delegation may include members of the Senate, members of the House of Representatives, members of the Senate, members of the House of Representatives, members of the Senate's committees, members of the Senate's committees, members of the Senate's committees, members of the Senate's committees, members of the Senate's committees, members of the Senate's committees, members of the Senate's committees, members of the Senate's committees, members of the Senate's committees, members of the Senate's committees, members of the Senate's committees, members of the Senate's committees, members of the Senate's committees, members of the Senate's committees, members of the Senate's committees, members of the Senate's committees, members of the Senate'
According to the law, in case of doubts related to the flights of the Sejm and Senate Marshals, the head of the Communist Party of the Republic of Poland will ask for their explanation.
If such doubts are not clarified within the appointed time, the head of the Communist Party of the Republic of Poland will be obliged to notify the heads of the Sejm or Senate offices about the lack of possibility of organizing such a flight.

Poles after the first training in Paris, waiting for the last rival
Polish volleyball players held their first training in Paris on Friday, where they will compete in a bronze medal match on Saturday.
Their first win came in a 3–1 defeat to the Slovenians in Ljubljana.
There was a lot of talk about their troubles with the trip to this duel.
This time it was without such problems – on Friday morning they went together with the Slovenians by charter to Paris, and a few hours later they held training in the famous Bercy hall.
According to the reports of people present at the classes, the trainer of the world champions was irritated.
As Heynen's assistant Michał Mieszko Gogol pointed out, this time the main task was not just the practice of volleyball elements.
“We went to the hall, but for the most part it was time for the band.
It was about spending more time together than training.
We talk, we think about how to rebuild it as a team,” he said.
He said that the semi-final defeat was a painful lesson for both the players and the coaching staff.
“We were brutally brought to the ground.
Without two sentences, we are disappointed.
We still believed that we would come back to this match.
We discussed this match between us in the staff, the coach talked a lot with the players.
The two main reasons for the defeat I would point to the ineffectiveness of the attack and much worse than usual handling of situational balls.
The Slovenes were much better than us in this respect,” he said.
In his opinion, the "White-Red" did not stand in the way of the stress associated with the performance against the supported by a loud and large audience of the tournament co-hosts.
He said that the World Championships could be a bit sleepy on the smooth way to the semifinals.
“Perhaps if we had a similar defeat in the group stage, we would have analysed this lesson more quickly and played differently later in the tournament.
But it's only a matter of time," he said.
Gogol hopes that the anger connected with Thursday's defeat to the Poles will be turned into aggression in the bronze match.
“I hope that we will show our true face then.
There is something to fight for.
We won the medal in 2011”, he reminded.
Paris is the fifth city and France the third country visited by Poles during these championships.
They played in the group stage in Rotterdam and Amsterdam, and went to Apeldoorn for the first two matches of the group stage, before moving to Ljubljana for the semi-finals.
Nick Kyrgios: severe punishment, but in suspension
The Australian tennis player was banned from the tournament for 16 weeks and fined $25,000 for his words, gestures and actions during the last ATP tournaments.
The ATP World Tour players are losing patience with Kyrgyzstan, but they still give him a chance to improve.
The summary of the most undisciplined professional tennis player of recent years looks threatening – 16 weeks of break plus a fine, but both penalties are suspended for half a year – a trial period in which a tenacious athlete will be able to improve.
Nick Kyrgios is only 24 years old, but he has been working for a long time and has achieved a kind of tennis world record – he had to pay the highest single financial penalty in the history of the discipline for breaking the rules of conduct on the court and next to him.
He was known for his loud curses, strange gestures, unsportsmanlike behavior, insulting the judge and the spectators, and breaking two rockets in a losing match against Karen Khachanov, all of which cost him $113,000.00 after the August ATP Masters 1000 in Cincinnati.
He did not play for long at the 2019 US Open, but managed to publicly say that ATP officials were "corrupt", which hurt the organization's authorities so much that they instituted a disciplinary investigation against Kyrgios and after a few weeks issued the said verdict of suspension of the starts and another fine.
He was forgiven for speaking about corruption after hearing the accused and knowing the context of his statement.
In the explanatory statement, however, the tennis activists said that the investigation showed that Kyrgyz's behaviour throughout the past 12 months in many cases raised serious objections and constituted an almost continuous violation of the rules, that he constantly insulted people associated with tournaments and spectators, hence the high penalty.
The court ordered Kyrgios to comply with the following conditions within the next six months: Kyrgios must no longer violate the rules of the Code of Conduct for Professional Tennis Players in any way, in particular, he must no longer curse, destroy missiles, argue with judges and the public, or otherwise behave indecently and vulgarly.
He was also advised to seek "continuous support" from mental health coaches during tournaments and also to consult with people specializing in dealing with athletes who are not coping well.
Nick Kyrgyz's first comment on the verdict was, "Hey, everybody, I can still play.
I just have to control my behavior, that’s all.”
The Australian would have at least two weeks off in practice, as he had a severe shoulder injury in the Laver Cup, so he had to give up the next races in Beijing (30 September – 6 October) and Shanghai (6–13 October).
In the ATP rankings, Kyrgios is ranked 27th.
This year he won two tournaments – in Washington and Acapulco, earned over $1.3 million, so even after the fines he will have a lot left.
GUS: Life in Poland is getting better
The report on household budgets published on Friday by the Central Statistical Office shows that as many as 44 percent of households rated their material situation as good or rather good.
The percentage was 37.2% a year earlier, in 2016 it was 33.5%, and before that – since 2009, when the statistical office first examined subjective assessments of the situation of households – it never exceeded 30%.
In the previous year, a total of 8.1 percent of households considered their material situation to be bad or rather bad, compared to 11.2 percent a year earlier and more than 20 percent in 2009.
The best is the material situation of households of self-employed people.
In this group, it is considered good or rather good by more than 70% of respondents.
On the other extreme are the pensioners' households, where the percentage of such responses was only 18%.
The number of children also has a big influence on the subjective assessment of the material situation of households.
The worst situation is experienced by parents who raise their children alone, of whom 32% declare a good or rather good material situation.
Among couples with children, this percentage varies (depending on the number of children) from 55 to 60 percent, and among households without children it is 48.8 percent.
The effect of the 500+ programme is clearly visible in these statistics.
Before it was launched (in 2016), the worst assessment of their material situation was made by parents raising their children alone and families with many children (with at least three children).
Improving subjective assessments of the material situation of Poles reflects the rapid growth of income, especially from work.
But that is not all, because the percentage of households that consider their situation to be good is increasing faster than real income.
Moreover, at the level of voivodships there is no clear relationship between the level of income and the assessment of the material conditions of households.
The best assessments are made by the inhabitants of the Opole Voivodeship, where 48.9% of the respondents consider their situation as good or rather good.
The following voivodeships are: Lubuskie (47.7%), Śląskie (47.6%), Mazowieckie (47.3%) and zachodniopomorskie (47.1%).
Meanwhile, in Opolskie, the disposable income (i.e. after paying taxes and contributions) amounted to less than 94% of the national average, and in Lubusz, 98%.
The highest incomes were inhabitants of Mazowieckie (120% of the national average) and Silesia (104%).
On average, in Poland, the disposable income per person amounted to PLN 1693 in 2018.
In real terms (after adjustment for the impact of price changes) it increased by 4.3% compared to 2017.
Compared to previous years, this is a fairly low result.
In 2016, per capita income increased by 7%, and a year later by 6.3%.
While the increase in income slows down, it also inhibits the growth in expenditure.
These per person amounted to PLN 1187, which means that in real terms they decreased by 0.7%.
This is the first such case since 2013.
In 2017, expenditure per person increased by 1.9% in real terms, and by 4.3% in 2016.
Research on household budgets suggests that statistical households currently spend 70.1% of their disposable income, while in 2014 this share exceeded 80% and by 2006 it exceeded 90%.

USA: Three suicides among aircraft crew
Three sailors committed suicide on board the USS George H. W. Bush last week, the US Navy said.
In the last two years, a total of five crew members of this ship have been killed.
The first suicide occurred in July 2017, and the second in November 2017.
According to CNN, all three sailors shot themselves last week.
The ship was named for George H. W. Bush, who was aboard the USS Virginia.
So far, the participation of third parties has been ruled out.
Moreover, deaths are not to be linked.
“We need everyone to get involved in making suggestions and ideas on how we can prevent another suicide.
I want to stress that there is no stigmatisation or other repercussions related to the search for help”, wrote Captain Sean Bailey, the ship’s commander, on Facebook.
The Pope is critical of the non-Siolovsky.
John Paul II did nothing
In a conversation with Piotr Lekszycki Stefan Niesiołowski emphasized that in 1981 John Paul II was a huge authority for opposition activists.
“In fact, every sentence of his was accepted.”
Some of his actions were later criticized.
“For me, the fact that John Paul II was unable to eliminate Rydzyk’s harmful activities is a great shadow on his pontificate.
After all, this redemptorist – a harmful to the Church and Poland – developed his media in the best way possible during the life of the Polish pope,” he explained.
The former politician of the Polish People's Party admitted: "There were murmurs of discontent, the pope said something, once Rydzyk did not accept, but he had power and for politics he could simply throw him out of the Church or send him on a mission to New Caledonia or Fiji to collect money for the poor.
However, John Paul II did not do this, as did his successors”, explained Niesiołowski.
“Besides that, there was the fatal case of paedophilia and the actions of the Church, or rather their absence.
I was thinking ahead a little, but I wanted to pay attention to the whole of his life.
We have known about the scale of pedophilia in the Church for a relatively recent time.
The question arises how it is possible that John Paul II, being the head of the Church, did not know about these abominable things”, says Niesiołowski in an interview with the journalist.
In the opinion of the former politician of the Polish People's Party, the Polish Church is an ally of the PiS.
“We must admit that during the Solidarity period the Church was our most important ally.
All the celebrations began with the Holy Mass, and crosses were hung everywhere.
Now these crosses are written, they have become a symbol of dictatorship – a sign of the written regime.
I repeat: one of the biggest unpleasant surprises is that people like Rydzyk are shaking the Polish Church, that John Paul II did nothing about it and that today the Church is an ally of the PiS.
This is the black chapter of the Polish Church, for which the elephant will pay him,” Niesiołowski argued.
“I hope that Pope Francis will pursue Jędraszewski, Rydzyk and a few others of this type,” he concluded.

Disqualified griffin
The match between Gryf Wejherowo and Lechia Gdańsk in the Polish Cup did not end tragically when the goalkeeper of the opposing team, Zlatan Alomerović, was missed by a millimeter by fans from Wejherowo.
After the match, the match was suspended for 20 minutes.
The PZPN committee investigating this case imposed a severe penalty on Gryf, excluding him from future games.
The club will not be able to compete in the Polish Cup in the 2020–2021 season.
In addition, fans will not be allowed to enter their own stadium in the next match.
They will not be able to play in the league until 31 December.
The stadium was also used by fans of Wrocław Śląska.
However, the PZPN's verdict was milder, because Silesia had warned that similar events might occur and had alerted the relevant authorities to the matter.
Despite this, the services allowed the sector of Łódź supporters to be thrown with their fists, chairs to be set on fire and the economy sector to be forced.
The match was suspended for eight minutes and the police had to use a water cannon.
The PZPN punished Silesia with a one-time stadium ban in the next match in the Polish Cup and banned the organization of trips to matches in this and the next edition of the Polish Cup.
The ban on travel also included the league matches of the Ekstraklasa, but there will last until 31 December.
Names of foreign cities on road signs also in Polish
GDDKiA plans to replace the signage on the entire managed road network by the end of 2020.
GDDKiA Rzeszów
In Podkarpackie, the implementation of the amendment of the regulation of the Ministry of Infrastructure on, among others, the registration of the names of foreign cities on road signs also in Polish has begun.
"L'viv" appears next to "L'viv".
In our province, the changes will be introduced on 94 road signs set at the A4 motorway and national roads: DK19, DK94.
As we hear, it is to be easier, clearer and simpler.
The new guidelines result from the amendment of the Regulation of the Minister of Infrastructure on detailed technical conditions for road signs and signals and road safety equipment.
“We should remember that the names of towns in neighbouring countries often have Polish sound.
Thanks to the change in law we have prepared, they will finally appear on the signs on our roads.
We are starting the introduction of the new signage from the sub-Carpathian section of the A4 motorway”, informed the Minister of Infrastructure Andrzej Adamczyk.
In the Podkarpackie region, the changes will be introduced on 94 road signs set at the A4 motorway and national roads: DK19, DK94.
The total cost of the investment?
200,000.
The new signage will be implemented first on the A4 motorway, which is planned by 1 November 2019.
What is the idea to look like?
It will be used without changing the boards, on the principle of stickers.
They will replace the current names of the villages with new ones written in Polish on existing signs.
Both names will be written in one line – first in Polish, then in the original, in parentheses.
This will be a great help for people who do not know the spelling of the names of foreign cities in the language of the country where they are located.

Someone shot the swan from the windmill
In the pond in Zameczno in Lower Silesia, residents noticed a swan with problems with its wings.
After hunting and visiting the veterinarian, it turned out that someone had set up a target with the animal – a blowtorch shell was found in his body.
“The information about the injured bird was received from the villagers of the Wild Animal Rehabilitation Centre in Nowa Sól.
The animal was reported to have broken wings.
We went to the place.
It was immediately apparent that something was very wrong with him.
We acted quickly and precisely so as not to harm him or expose him to additional stress.
The swan was caught and taken to the veterinarian.
After the first X-ray it was already known that someone made a shooting shield from it.
There were pieces of bolt in his body,” says Marcin Walasek, President of Malpol, which manages a rehabilitation centre.
The Centre
“The wounds were cleaned, the bird was given antibiotics, water was provided, and a safe place was provided in the centre where he would spend the winter.
We are trying to strengthen it.
He is unable to fly.
Release now would mean that he would probably not survive the winter,” Walasek adds.
After the recovery, the staff intends to release the swan to the same pond in the spring.
The authorities of Żukowice intend to inform the prosecutor's office about the case after receiving information about the cause of the animal's poor health.
The event happened in Zamecze
Gowin: “We must stimulate Polish small trade”
“The effective taxation of hypermarkets does not solve the problem of small trade, we will have to consider whether the state has any instruments to stimulate Polish trade,” said Jarosław Gowin, Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Science and Higher Education, Leader of the Agreement.
Gowin, during a conversation in the radio station "Sygnałach dnia" (Signs of the Day) in Jedynka, stated that trade is dominated by international networks that impose such low margins on Polish producers that actually Polish companies cannot develop.
Noting that this problem is very difficult to fight, the deputy prime minister reminded that the PiS government tried to face this at the very beginning of the term of office, but got a "counter from the EC".
“We have won before the courts of justice and I hope that if the United Right wins the next elections and forms a government, we will return to this issue,” he said.
He also said that "the effective taxation of hypermarkets does not solve the problem of Polish, and therefore small trade".
“After that, we will have to consider whether the government, the state has any instruments that allow to stimulate Polish trade,” said Gowin.
In May, the EU Court ruled that the European Commission had erred in declaring the Polish retail tax to be an unlawful public aid.
The Retail Sales Tax Act provided for the introduction of two rates of trade tax: 0.8% of income between PLN 17 million and PLN 170 million per month and 1.4% of income above PLN 170 million per month.
The tax was to apply from September 2016.
In September 2016, the EC opened an infringement proceeding against Poland.
Brussels argued at the time that the tax structure could favour smaller shops, which could be considered public aid.
He then claimed that the tax was being imposed in an unlawful manner.
It also ordered the suspension of the tax until it was analysed by officials in Brussels.
Poland did not agree to this position, but the tax collection was suspended.
The EU Court decision in May opened the way for the reintroduction of the tax, but it did not end the matter.
On 24 July, the Commission appealed to the Court of Justice.
On Thursday, the press service of the EUSC informed PAP that the case is currently at a written stage, in which both the European Commission and the Polish government present their arguments in writing.
It is not yet known whether and when the oral procedure, i.e. the hearing of the parties and possible debate, will start.
It takes a good few to a dozen months from the appeal to the announcement of the judgment.
“Such proceedings last on average for a year,” said a source in the Luxembourg Court.
How to dress a child for baptism?
We highlight some practical solutions
Baptism is an extremely important ceremony in the life of the infant and its parents.
It is often the first occasion when the whole family gathers around the child, celebrating his or her arrival in the world.
No wonder that newly baked mom and dad want their comfort to look the best on this day.
But before you make a final decision about the baby's outfit, consider whether it will also be comfortable.
In shops you can find many costumed sets that do not provide the toddler with proper comfort.
So what should we be looking at?
The basic criterion for choosing the baptismal garment is the age of the child
Until recently, several weeks old babies were baptized, dressed in white sets and placed in the same barrels or large poduch.
Today, children who attend the sacrament are often older: several months, a year or even more.
It is not difficult to guess that such a big comfort needs a slightly different baptismal garment.
If your child is 3 to 4 months old on the day of baptism, he or she will probably spend the ceremony in a pram or in the hands of parents or baptists.
The best solution will be to dress it in comfortable cotton sleeping bags or suits.
Although this item of clothing is considered a daily dress, it is sufficient to find its holy variants, for example with a waistband or lace.
For the boy, the body with a print of a fly and scarves will be ideal.
For older children, you can afford to have more fantasy in your clothes.
The girl will look beautiful in a simple tulle dress
Many parents of girls look with enthusiasm at the richly decorated, waffle dresses for baptism complete with coats, belts and caps.
Unfortunately, a large number of manufacturers use artificial, non-breathable materials for their products, in which the child is simply uncomfortable.
In search of suitable clothing, you'd better look at the Asanti for Kids store, which offers elegant outfits on cotton linings.
Delicate tulle skirts, satin dresses, lace, appliqués and charming sets will make your daughter look beautiful and feel comfortable.
The perfect outfit for a little gentleman: a cotton suit
Until recently, the parents of boys were in fashion for suits that were copies of "adult" models.
Polyester navy pants, stiff collars and muskets often made the young elegants loudly demonstrate their dissatisfaction.
Today, they have been replaced by comfortable cotton sets.
Just look at the sets available in Asanti for Kids, that is, soft jersey shorts, and a blouse decorated with a vest pattern at the front.
These pages look extremely devout, and at the same time do not interfere with the movements of the toddler learning the world.
Krystyna Pawłowicz published a statement of assets
Krystyna Pawłowicz made a statement of assets at the end of her term.
It is estimated that the company has saved £110,000.
We should remind that Pawłowicz announced her retirement from politics.
At the end of his term, he has the amount of PLN 110 thousand
As a result of the statement made by the Member, she is receiving a pension of PLN 4.7 thousand per month.
The company owns a small apartment worth £570,000 and rents it out for £880,000 a month.
The ambassador also invests in industrial metals, estimating the investment at PLN 150,000.
The statement of assets was also published earlier by Jarosław Kaczyński.
Voting on the Conservative Party conference recess
The British Parliament voted against a three-day recess in the House of Commons for the Conservative Party's annual conference, which the government requested.
289 voted in favour, 306 against.
The House of Commons does not normally hold any meetings during party conferences, so that Members do not have to resign from either of them or from parliamentary sessions.
However, the opposition parties have recognised that at such a crucial time, the last weeks before the UK's planned exit from the European Union on 31 October, Parliament should not interrupt its work.
The government's request for a recess was approved by 289 MPs, with 306 against.
Two opposition parties after the conventions
The failure to agree to a recess may be seen as political revenge by the opposition on Prime Minister Boris Johnson for his decision to suspend parliament for five weeks (on Tuesday the decision was found by the Supreme Court to be unlawful and unprecedented) and for not wanting to apologize for it after the judges' ruling.
The House of Commons resumed its session on Wednesday, and the most important event of the day was Johnson's speech and the subsequent heated debate.
Johnson accused the opposition of blocking the Brexit and avoiding early elections.
“It is time to implement the Brexit.
It must be implemented in order to respect the result of the referendum.
Brexit must come so that we can deal with an agreement on citizens' priorities, on healthcare, on the cost of living.
Brexit must be realised so that we can unite this country,” Johnson said.
The Conservative Party conference is due to start in Manchester this Sunday and last until Wednesday 2 October.
Conferences of the two main opposition groups – the Labour Party and the Liberal Democrats – have already taken place.
One of the reasons Johnson gave for the long suspension of parliament was party conferences.
Media: Andrzej Duda blames Israel for anti-Semitic attacks in Poland
“President Andrzej Duda believes that the anti-Semitic attacks in Poland are a reaction to the anti-Polish rhetoric of Israeli leaders,” write foreign media.
The President's spokesman strongly denied these reports.
"It's just not true," Błażej Spychalski wrote on Twitter.
Israeli media, including Haaretz and Jerusalem Post, citing the Jewish Insider, said that Andrzej Duda, during a meeting with representatives of the Jewish diaspora in the Polish consulate in New York, stated that Israel was to blame for the recent anti-Semitic attacks in Poland.
The President said that the increase in anti-Semitic attacks in Poland is a reaction to the anti-Polish rhetoric of Israeli leaders.
He referred to the words of Israeli Foreign Minister Katz, who said in February that "the Poles have put anti-Semitism with mother's milk".
Andrzej Duda said he regretted that Israel did not apologize for the humiliating statements of its politicians.
He also mentioned the act of aggression against the Polish ambassador to Israel Marek Magierowski.
In May, he was attacked by a striking man who shouted: "Polish, Polish".
“The quotation is not only inaccurate.
It's just not true," he wrote on Twitter.
He said that Duda "never said that Israel was responsible for the recent anti-Semitic attacks in Poland".
According to Spychalski, the portal "invented it".
According to the interviewers of the "JI", during the meeting there was also a dispute between Holocaust survivors, awarded the Commander's Cross of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Poland Edward Mosberg and Rabbi Shmuley Boteach.
Mosberg was to agree with President Duda's words and say that it was Jews from Israel "like Israel Kac" who were responsible for the rise of antisemitism.
According to the Boteach website, Mosberg had to stop speaking.
Who is Banas and what is his fault?
The tenement house rented by the tenants led the journalist to discover negligence in the property statements of Marian Banasia.
We summarize another affair that shook the ruling camp.
The TVN’s “Supervisor” journalists revealed that Marian Banas, the president of the Supreme Chamber of Control, has not entered in the property statement of a 400-meter tenement house, which is located in the Kraków Podgórze, in recent years.
Moreover, his landlord had to run a sex business in the mentioned tenement house (and so rent rooms for hours).
The building itself was supposedly a security for the repayment of the loan since 2016.
Bertold Kittel, on the television show Supervisor, pointed out the irregularities.
The journalist revealed that the building was rented by people connected with the criminal world to use as a place for "erotic meetings".
The clients were men using prostitutes.
The charges against him were unclear and vague.
Interestingly, the tenement rented by the tenants led the journalist to discover negligence in Banasia's property statements.
The building itself was described in them unclearly, and the income from its rent was to be reduced.
“The assets of Marian Banasia and his wife can be worth between 6 and 8 million PLN.
In total, the spouses can boast of two houses, three apartments, savings [...]”, writes Money.pl.
And as the analysis of the portal shows, the Banasia tenement house itself was worth about PLN 3 million.
The Central Anti-Corruption Bureau currently controls Marian Banasia's financial statements for the years 2015-2019.
Banas announced that until the end of her career she would suspend her activities in NIK. “I will ask the Marshal for a free holiday”, he assured.
The opposition demands clarification.
“We do not hear the CBA expanding its investigation or speeding up the examination of Marian Banasi’s financial statements.
Therefore, we are forced to expel the state authorities and notify the possibility of committing a crime [...]”, said PO-KO member Mariusz Witczak.
“If a normal Pole had so blatantly low valuation of his real estate, he would already have 10 checks, tax allowance and criminal proceedings,” he added.
He went high, he fell low
Marian Banaś is the new President of the Supreme Chamber of Control.
He was appointed to the position on 30 August 2019 for a six-year term.
His candidacy was submitted by Law and Justice and the votes of the party's politicians were approved.
He was previously associated with the NIK from 1992 to 2005, working in this institution as a co-worker of Lech Kaczyński.
During the first government of the PiS (2005-2008), Banas held the position of the President of the Customs Service and also the Undersecretary of State in the Ministry of Finance.
Since 2015 he has been the head of the Customs Service, and since 2017 he has been managing the National Tax Administration.
He served as Minister of Finance in the government of Mateusz Morawiecki for three months.
Cooler Master launches a graphics card holder
Graphic cards can weigh a lot nowadays, and this naturally makes room for a category of products that would have been in vain to look for on store shelves a decade ago.
This is the solution – the holder for the ELV8 RGB graphics card – presented by Cooler Master.
The new graphics card holder model is not only a functional solution that allows you to maintain your graphics card more reliably without relying solely on the strength of the PCI-express slot.
The Cooler Master ELV8 RGB also has an additional task – decorative.
"Rzeczpospolita": Ignoring the policeman's orders will be punished
As the newspaper reports, the police officer's disregard of a specific order is to be a new type of offence, threatened with fines, arrest or imprisonment.
The political unionists want to introduce such a change.
The idea was passed to the Sejm Committee on Petitions.
“The case is serious, because already every year more than half a million criminal cases are brought to Polish courts,” we read.
"Rzeczpospolita" has determined that the petition, which the Independent Professional Union of Policemen writes to the MPs on the amendment of the Code of Offences has a chance of success.
The authors of the petition propose a new wording of Article 54a of the Code of Offences.
The law states that "anyone who fails to comply with the orders or demands of a public official issued within the limits of the law shall be subject to arrest, fine or restriction of liberty".
"Paragraph 3 of this provision provides for an identical penalty for those who, without carrying out orders, prevent or hinder the performance of a service activity," the daily reports.
Sociologist Andrzej Kowalski told Rzeczpospolita that although he agrees with the main message of the proposal, he is afraid that if it is implemented, it may be used in matters of political demonstrations.
“In situations of freedom demonstrations, it would be unfavourable and instead of alleviating the situation, it would even exacerbate it,” he adds.
According to the statistics provided by the newspaper, 86% of citizens positively assessed police interventions in 2018 and that every month the services undertake 1.5 million interventions in the city.
Buras is worried about Europe
Jáchym Topol writing has in blood.
Among his ancestors are editors, translators, writers.
His father, Josef Topol, was one of the most important Czech playwrights after the war, today listed in the same row as Václav Havel.
From the beginning, therefore, there was a curse of talent hanging over Yachim, which he tries to use.
After eight years, he returned with "The Sensitive Man".
The protagonists are Buras and Soňa, together with their two sons, who do not form a typical Czech family.
They are travelling actors, travelling around Europe.
He is a lover of Shakespeare and a thief, she is a one-eyed translator who does not break up with a bottle of wine.
One of the boys from birth did not make a sound, and for the other time stopped in the days of the infants.
But it is not the heroes who are the most important in this story.
All of them are just a background for observing a world in which there is no longer room for artistic nomads.
It is a world of a flooded province, a society of old, suspicious people and disconnected youth.
“Sensitive Man” sometimes turns into absurd theatre.
The narrative follows the didaskalia, and the conversations of the characters create this world.
The scene is Europe full of fears about its future, but also of constant questions about the past.
Belgium: Brussels Airlines cancelled 105 flights due to Thomas Cook bankruptcy
Although the British travel agency Thomas Cook has collapsed, his Belgian subsidiary Neckermann is still in operation.
The company has problems.
According to VRT, Brussels Airlines announced that it would cancel 105 flights in October due to problems related to the bankruptcy of Thomas Cook.
Neckermann also laid off 75 employees.
All office trips booked in Belgium will be cancelled, but the holidaymakers will be able to receive a refund.
The court in Ghent also declared the bankruptcy of three Belgian subsidiaries: Thomas Cook Belgium, Thomas Cook Retail and Thomas Cook Financial Services.
Currently, around 12,000 Belgians are abroad on trips bought from Thomas Cook.
Another 40,000 people were to leave the office by the end of the year.
On Monday, Thomas Cook Belgium spokeswoman Leen Segers said the company is now "fully operational" despite the bankruptcy announcement by the British parent company, which caused concern among employees and customers.
The office then reassures that customers who purchased tours there will go on holiday.
Thomas Cook – the oldest and one of the largest travel agencies in the world – announced bankruptcy on the night of Sunday to Monday.
The immediate cause of the bankruptcy was the collapse of last-resort talks with creditors and potential investors on Sunday.
The creditors demanded that, in addition to the £900 million rescue plan agreed in August, the company should secure an additional £200 million for the winter period, when travel agencies usually have lower turnover.
The company's debts have been increasing for several years, resulting in a debt of £1.6 billion.
"Mikhail Kubiak vs. Slovenia 1–3".
“I don’t think Slovenia played fantastic.
We played very poorly.
This tournament is not over for us yet”, said the captain of the Polish national volleyball team Michał Kubiak after the defeat of Slovenia 1:3 in the semi-finals of the European Championship.
Görlitz in Germany offers free accommodation with review
Free accommodation in exchange for a review – this is the extraordinary offer prepared for the German Görlitz.
The measures are intended to help combat the progressive decline in the population of the city.
Görlitz is the most easterly city in Germany.
The beautiful pastel old town attracts 140 thousand tourists every year.
However, according to The Guardian, the city is facing significant challenges.
Görlitz has the lowest wages in Germany.
The city is also experiencing a steady decline in population.
After the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, most of the population moved westwards, resulting in a 25% decline in the city's population.
In 2013 it had 54,000 members.
To combat depopulation, officials came up with the idea of offering free monthly accommodation in the city.
So far, 150 applications have been received.
Two-thirds of the population is made up of people from the cities.
The programme was also attended by people from Hungary, the Czech Republic, the United States and the United Kingdom.
“When we applied, we thought that the programme was to convince people to move to Görlitz,” said one of the project participants.
“Now we feel it doesn’t matter whether we stay here after four weeks or not,” he added.
The city has seven thousand vacant flats and unemployment is three times higher than the national average.
Although the city authorities hope that some will move permanently, the main aim of the programme is to obtain the opinions of the participants.
The information gathered from interviews and questionnaires is intended to help revitalise smaller German cities.
“We want to know more about what people need and, if they decide to move, what their motivation was,” said Robert Knippschild, programme manager.
Other cities have already experimented with ideas to attract new residents, offering them incentives in the form of accommodation.
The first was Detroit, which introduced a program to pay promising young professionals to live and work in the city for a year.
Today, such solutions are used in many places, from the Greek island of Antikythera to Candela in Italy, or in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
