Father Joseph Witko: I saw Jesus in a white robe
He is a charismatic man.
Mass for the release and healing is attended by crowds.
He was ten years old when inexplicable things began to happen in his life.
Today, through the Franciscan, others are experiencing it.
Crowds attend Fr. Witko’s Mass for Liberation and Healing
Once the parents of a 7-month-old child who had a 7.5 mm hole in his heart came to him.
It was to be operated on.
Father Joseph Witko prayed over him.
On the same day, the boy was taken to the hospital for treatment.
Surprised doctors said: “The operation is not necessary, the loss is only 1.5 mm”.
The parents were crying with happiness.
After another prayer, the Franciscan hole disappeared completely.
The spiritual extraordinary actions of the Creator began to experience already as a teenager.
In his dreams, purgatory souls came to him asking for help.
I was awakened at night and urged to pray for the dead and those who died at that moment – he recalls.
He also experienced the presence of an evil spirit.
And he had a vision of what happens to a man who commits mortal sin.
“My body started to change.
I lost my human characteristics and began to look like an animal,” he says.
The invisible force lifted him up, he could not get his voice out.
He felt that he was lost.
Then God showed him salvation.
“Submerged in the waters of the river symbolising the holy baptism, I was released and returned to my human form...”, he says.
He did not tell anyone about these strange experiences.
His vocation matured in him.
He was 16 years old when he joined the Franciscans.
In his sermons he did not only want to talk about Jesus.
He wanted people to experience Him alive.
Members of the Charismatic Community of Renewal in the Holy Spirit
The healing masses celebrated by Father Witko are attended by many people who are counting on getting rid of the disease.
The priest emphasizes, however, that their main goal is spiritual healing, not bodily healing.
The first defeat of Kolpinga FRAC Jarosław
This afternoon (September 26th this year) Kolpinga FRAC team deservedly won the current Polish champion Dart Bogoria Grodzisk Mazowiecki in the 3rd LOTTO Superleague Table Tennis.
In such a personal set-up as they presented with the threatened, Jarosławians have little chance of winning against the league's sovereigns.
The match was won by Dartmouth.
The team still lacks the team's newly appointed leader, Chen Jingqi.
Perhaps with it in the composition Jarosławians would reach for the third time in a row triumph in the new season.
The young Asian Qiyao Han probably has not yet grown up to win with such trousers as the Greek Panagiotis Gionis or the Czech Pavel Sirucek.
Not even with one of the most promising Poles, Marek Badowski.
The player from Hellada was the biggest star of the match in the MOSiR hall at Sikorskiego Street in Jarosław.
Both in the fight with Qiyao Hanen and Kou Lei, he was a class of his own.
After three matches Kolping FRAC led 2:1.
Kou Lei probably defended Marek Badowski, and Daniel Górak after an exciting, five-point fight – Pavel Sirucka.
But then it was worse.
Gionis did not give Lei a chance.
One could still hope for a win for two points, but Qiyao Han did not match Badowski.
There will be no additional research for seniors.
Why?
According to Rafał Trzaskowski, a program of free prophylactic tests for seniors aged 70 and 80 was to be introduced in Warsaw.
However, the idea will not be implemented because it has not been accepted by the Ministry of Health and the Agency for the Protection of Medical Technologies and Tariffs, which is subordinate to it.
In the explanatory statement, the agency explained that the target group was wrongly selected.
"The above actions may even result in the detection of individual disease units, which may contribute to the deepening of difficulties in accessing the benefits of the NFZ and negatively affect the patient, causing anxiety and discomfort associated with a falsely positive test result," it is written.
The decision of the Ministry is not understood by the President of the capital.
“The money is ours, we have planned the money for it.
Only the government is afraid that if people examine themselves, they will later go to the doctor, which is absurd, because it is precisely in order to bring about a situation in which prevention can be carried out more quickly.
All specialists know that this helps in terms of the burden on the health system, because it helps in the rapid detection of diseases and in a reliable approach to health.
The government has a very strange position here, which I do not understand”, said Rafał Trzaskowski.
"It is hard for me to imagine that competent specialists say: Let's not study, because there will be longer queues at the doctor, and if such specialists advise the government, then I am not surprised that the health service is in such a state", added the politician of the Polish People's Party.
Palestine responds to Israel: We will destroy all previous agreements
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas announced Thursday at the UN General Assembly session that he would break all agreements with Israel if the country's future government tries to meet Benjamin Netanyahu's announcement of annexation of the occupied Palestinian territories.
"If the future government of Israel, which will be formed, proceeds to implement this plan, we will nullify all the agreements signed (with Israel) and withdraw from all the commitments made," he declared.
"We will completely and completely reject the whole plan," Abbas threatened under pressure.
“It is our duty to defend all our rights by all possible means – no matter what the consequences – by fully engaging in the application of international law and the fight against terrorism,” declared the President of the Palestinian Authority, who had already made similar declarations in July.
Netanyahu, the current prime minister of Israel, was again given the task of forming a government after the September 17 elections.
A week before the election, he announced that if he won, he would announce the annexation of the Jordan Valley and that he intended to incorporate all Jewish settlements in the West Bank into Israel.
In the early 1990s, Israel and the Palestinians, then led by Yasser Arafat, signed a series of peace agreements sponsored by the United States.
The 84-year-old Abbas also promised during the session of the UN General Assembly to hold general elections in Palestinian lands.
The last one took place in 2006.
“After returning to the country, I call for local elections in the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem, and anyone who opposes them will have to answer for their actions before God and the international community,” the Palestinian president solemnly declared.
Abbas also defended in his speech the rights of Palestine, treated as a permanent observer in the UN, to exercise the powers of "full members of the UN and all its organs and institutions".
The Palestinian leader concluded by calling on the international community to "force Israel to comply with the United Nations resolutions with full respect".
Israeli Ambassador Danny Danon briefly responded to Abbas' speech, stating that the Palestinian leader "wants to focus in the UN on the efforts of the Palestinian Authority against Israel, rather than to fight the calls for terrorism in the Authority under his leadership".
However, Danon did not refer to Netanyahu's annexation of the occupied Palestinian territories.
Rescuers want defibrillators in the neuralgic points of Przemyśl
The history of the border crossing shows that an automatic AED defibrillator can save a human life.
The Provincial Emergency Rescue Station in Przemyśl wants such devices to be located in neuralgic points of the city.
For their attitude, the officials received congratulatory diplomas from the Provincial Rescue Station in Przemyśl.
Applicant Daniel Cyrnek, Senior Applicant Grzegorz Bal and Commissioner Jacek Wójcik are officials of the Podkarpackie Customs and Treasury Office in Przemyśl.
On August 28, they were on duty at the Polish-Ukrainian border crossing in Medyka. An officer of the Customs and Excise Service noticed an unconscious man lying in the pedestrian zone.
A Chinese activist died in custody as a result of torture.
He wanted to exercise the rights guaranteed by the Constitution
Cao Shuxia, the activist's wife, was called on September 23 by a Communist Party secretary from her home village to inform her that her husband had just died in Hengyang military hospital.
What was the cause of death – he did not reveal.
In the morgue, Cao saw her husband's body slaughtered, unrecognizable.
“His eyes, ears, nose and mouth were all in blood,” says the woman.
“They wouldn’t let me take the cells with me, and there were a lot of policemen around who couldn’t get close to Wang.”
The police pressured her to sign a statement stating that her husband was seriously ill and had died as a result of an "unfortunate accident".
PLN 105 million for companies from the video game industry from the National Centre for Research and Development
Almost PLN 105 million of co-financing will go to companies from the gaming industry, creating innovative solutions.
The National Centre for Research and Development announced on Friday the results of the third edition of the GameINN programme.
Among the nearly 30 projects supported by NCBR were: the development of a platform for creating terrain games based on an AR game engine that creates a map of the real world together with an application that allows users to transfer data; a test and training platform for verifying practical skills in the workplace and professional development using VR and AI technologies; an innovative game simulating the management of real production processes using an innovative gameplay model based on the interaction of the virtual world with the real world using the concept of Industry 4.0 – stated in the NCBR communication sent to PAP on Friday.
The aim of the GameINN sector programme is to increase the competitiveness of the Polish video game industry on the global market by 2023.
According to NCBR, the Polish video game sector is already growing at a rate of 10% per year.
According to government data, the value of the Polish video game market in 2016 amounted to PLN 1.85 billion, while the forecast for 2019 is PLN 2.23 billion.
“The specially prepared GameINN research agenda and the already PLN 300 million support for entrepreneurs under this sectoral programme provide an important impetus for the further, dynamic growth of Polish gamedev,” reads the communication.
The video game industry is an excellent example of effective use of the potential that we have in Poland.
"The incentives introduced by the government for entrepreneurs who are committed to innovation, such as R&D concessions, competence improvement programs, IP boxes or support programs implemented by NCBR, drive the innovative activity of companies and allow them to compete more effectively on a very competitive market," says Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Science and Higher Education Jarosław Gowin, quoted in the communication.
The head of the Ministry of Science points out that the money for innovation not only goes to innovators in the form of project funding, but also remains in their pockets – three quarters more entrepreneurs benefited from the R&D rebate in 2018 than a year earlier.
"The amount of deducted costs for R&D activities amounted to PLN 1.7 billion, which resulted in savings of over PLN 300 million for companies benefiting from this rebate.
This is the equivalent of the support provided by NCBR in three editions of GameINN”, emphasizes the Deputy Prime Minister.
NCBR Director Wojciech Kamieniecki reminds that 78 innovative projects were awarded in two previous competitions with a total value of over PLN 211.2 million.
The great interest in the III competition and the variety of applications show that the video game industry has ideas and competences to further develop and increase its competitive advantages.
“I am particularly pleased that among the selected projects – as in previous editions – there are projects concerning solutions not only for entertainment, but also related to Industry 4.0,” he adds.
In the third GameINN competition, entrepreneurs, a consortium of entrepreneurs and a consortium of entrepreneurs with scientific units could apply for funding of up to PLN 20 million.
The NCBR received 87 applications for a total amount of approx. PLN 317 million.
The budget of the competition at the time of the announcement of the competition was PLN 100 million, but it was increased, so that 27 projects were granted almost PLN 105 million of co-financing.
Detailed information about the results of GameINN III competition is available on the website ncbr.gov.pl.
The GameINN sector programme is implemented as part of the Intelligent Development Operational Programme.
NCBR launched the program in 2016 in response to an initiative of entrepreneurs associated with the Polish Games Alliance, which includes companies such as CD Projekt, Techland, CI Games, Bloober Team and 11 bit studios.
Lamine Diaby-Fadiga confessed to stealing Kasper Dolberg's watch
The event occurred on September 16.
Dolberg, who was transferred from Ajax Amsterdam to Nice at the end of August, found out after training that his watch had disappeared from the locker room.
No matter what, it is worth EUR 70 000.
The next day, the angry Danish boy did not show up for classes, explaining his stomach problems.
The matter was mysterious from the beginning.
Players in the locker room have private safes, and the club ground is monitored.
According to the AFP, Diaby-Fadiga eventually confessed to the theft.
The 18-year-old had already apologized to Dolberg and other teammates and coach Patrick Vieira.
He also promised to return the Danish money for the watch.
Diaby-Fadiga is one of the most promising young footballers in France.
He moved to Nice at the age of thirteen to make his debut in the first team three years later.
He played in seven games this season.
He has recently signed a professional contract, but according to the L'Equipe newspaper, the club is likely to terminate him with immediate effect.
For the time being, he has initiated disciplinary proceedings against his player.
Nice, at least officially, refuses to comment on this matter.
Make sure you wash your hands well
We all know that they need to be washed (e.g. after coming home or before a meal).
But not everyone knows that in order to actually get rid of germs, you need to do it in the right way.
This is especially important now that autumn infections are approaching.
It takes at least 30–40 seconds for the washing to remove sufficiently dangerous bacteria and viruses from our hands
And most of us wash them shorter!
Just warm water and ordinary soap – it is not true that it must be antibacterial (many doctors even reject it).
When washing, we rub not only the bottoms and tops of the hands, but also: fingertips (joined or individually) – rub them with circular movements on the inside of the other hand, spaces between the fingers (split the hands, rubbing the fingers against each other), thumbs – each thumb we embrace the other hand and in such an embrace we turn it for a while to the right and left.
In an emergency situation (when it is not possible to wash hands) we should wipe hands with a wet cloth, and then use antibacterial gel (in drugstores, from 5 zł).
When using the public toilet, do not touch handles or doors with washed hands (recommendation of the Main Sanitary Inspectorate).
Open them with a paper towel.
Iranian President says he has rejected a proposal for talks with the US, Donald Trump denies
Tehran did not enter into talks with the American side during the UN General Assembly in New York, despite an offer by the Americans to lift the sanctions – Iranian President Hasan Rowhani declared on Friday.
U.S. President Donald Trump said that the Iranian side had requested the lifting of the restrictions, which he did not agree to.
According to Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, the Americans proposed to lift all sanctions on Tehran in exchange for negotiating a new international agreement.
It would regulate both Iran's nuclear programme and its ballistic missile programme.
Rowhani: Iran will not engage in talks under maximum pressure
The Iranian President stated that he did not agree to the talks because of the "toxic atmosphere".
He stated that he had met with American diplomats because he had been persuaded by France, Germany and the United Kingdom.
However, he stressed that Iran would not enter into talks in an atmosphere of "maximum pressure".
"Even if we want to negotiate with the Americans in the 5+1 format, no one can predict what the final outcome will be," Rowhani said.
The day before, the Iranian leader had said that he was not excluding talks with the US, and he had accused the European parties of favouring US sanctions on Iran.
He added that sanctions imposed on Iran after the US withdrawal from the nuclear deal "are a precondition that does not allow" for dialogue.
If we manage to lift this precondition and if America lifts sanctions and maximum pressure, then of course we can talk to America," he declared.
He added that he would not rule out meeting with US President Donald Trump, even though he did not agree to such a talk during the UN General Assembly last week.
Trump: “Iran asked, I said no”
Donald Trump wrote on Twitter that he rejected the Iranian side's request.
"Iran wanted me to lift the sanctions on them so that we could meet.
Of course I said 'no!' tweeted the US President.
Nuclear tension in the background
France, Germany and the United Kingdom are trying to ease tensions between Washington and Tehran in order to somehow rescue the 2015 agreement with Iran to which they were signatories.
In exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions, Iran would abandon its nuclear weapons programme and place the nuclear sector under the control of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
Since the United States withdrew from the agreement in May 2015, the remaining signatories have repeatedly confirmed that they want to keep the agreement in force.
So far, none of this has worked.
Washington is using maximum pressure tactics on Iran, and sanctions also include a full embargo on Iranian oil.
Tehran has announced that if it does not receive a permit to export the raw material, it will limit its obligations under the agreement every 60 days.

The judge of the Voivodeship Administrative Court in Warsaw and the husband of Emilia, who – according to her words and screens from WhatsApp – participated in a stalking against the judges, was returned to judgement by the NSA on Wednesday.
The reason: disciplinary proceedings have not been initiated against him, and thus there is no basis to uphold the order of the President of the WSA Wojciech Mazur to remove him from his duties.
Judge Jerzy Chromicki, the disciplinary spokesperson for the NSA, initiated an explanatory proceeding against Szmydt at the end of August, but it has not yet turned into proceedings against him.
Although the NSA, which acts as a disciplinary court in such cases, must deal with the WSA president's decision within a month of its issuance.
In this situation, a judge who publicly talked about his wife's psychological problems in order to discredit her, who was removed from the office of the KRS because of suspicion of participation in the group, will return to the court and will give judgments on behalf of the Republic of Poland.
Judge Schmydt denies his participation in the squad.
He claims that there is no evidence for this except for fake screens and the words of his wife, with whom he is divorced.
The other judges associated with “Kasta” claim exactly the same: they are all innocent, there is no evidence.
And quite possibly they will decide on their own.
Because the prosecutor's office has not moved a finger to secure evidence from their electronic media, it is also silent about the contents of Emilie Szmydt's phone, which it stopped in June in another case.
The police did not move a finger to secure the devices of the persons whom Judge Waldemar Żurek identified as persecutors in the February report.
There is no evidence – there is no issue of Szmydt, there is no issue of "Kasty".
Nor is it the case of the head of the NIK, Marian Banasia, about renting the tenement house to tenants and hiding the income.
The CBA checks his financial statements.
And he will check when he checks.
And the Committee on Parliamentary Ethics will not concern itself with Banas, because the Sejm is suspended (but the Committee on State Control somehow gathered to take a curious decision on the dismissal of Banas' deputies and appointment as his attorney-at-law, although the law does not provide for such a strange combination).
The whole thing reminds me of a movie novella, an American novella, about a wife coming home and finding her husband with his mistress in bed.
She is so amazed and overwhelmed that she cannot utter a word.
She is standing in the doorway naked, and at the same time the mistress quickly jumps out of bed, dresses and goes out.
And the husband washed the bed.
When the wife regains her voice and shouts: what is this?
Who is this woman?
My husband calmly asks: what woman, dear?
Only that in the case of “Kasta” or Banasia there is a parody of the state.
And this is not funny at all.

Kamila Litvinko in the high jump final
Earlier this season returning to the competition after the maternity break, the bronze medalist of the World Championships in London 2017, in the first attempt defeated 1.85 and 1.89 and in the second 1.92.
1.94 was achieved only in the third approach.
“I am glad.
I showed that I could fight, because the first attempt was completely unsuccessful.
In the final I will have to jump better technically”, admitted Lićwinko in front of the camera of Eurosport.
Vashti Cunningham of the United States and Karyna Demidik of Belarus were the best in the elimination round, with 1.94 points each.
Both teams were the only ones not to score any points.
The women's high jump final is scheduled for Monday.
It begins at 7.30 p.m. Polish time.
Kornel Morawiecki is in a critical condition in hospital
He was admitted to the hospital and the doctors described his condition as severe.
It should be added that he is conscious and aware.
“We believe that it will come out that he will win again.
We all pray that he will get back to health,” said an anonymous close person of Kornel Morawiecki in an interview with journalists of “Super Express”.
In the upcoming elections, the Prime Minister's father is running for the Senate.
“My closest family and politicians keep me alive,” Kornel Morawiecki said in an interview he gave to the journalists of Super Express two weeks ago.
In January, Super Express reported that Kornel Morawiecki, 78, had been admitted to the Military Hospital in Wrocław.
“I had strange, disturbing symptoms and went to the hospital.
It turned out that I had jaundice.
But the worst was in front of me.
When a CT scan was performed, it was found that I had pancreatic cancer...", the Prime Minister's father said.
A few days later, Kornel Morawiecki underwent a serious operation at the MSWiA hospital in Warsaw.
As Morawiecki said, President Andrzej Duda sent his personal chaplain, priest Zbigniew Kras, to the hospital.
The operation lasted about three hours and was successful.
“I know that many people prayed for me, for which I thank you very much.
Fortunately, I have no metastases.
I don't know yet if I will undergo chemotherapy.
I give myself into the hands of doctors specialists who are rather good-natured.
For now, after this heavy operation, I have to return to some state of usability.
I hope that everything will be fine,” Kornel Morawiecki said in January in an interview with SE.
“If I submitted to the examination too late, the situation would be tragic and I would say goodbye to this doll...”, he added.
Kraków: A 14-year-old girl is missing

On the evening of 26 September, she left her home and has not returned or made contact with her relatives.
She was last seen at the Old Guesthouse in Kraków.
Nel Stokłosa is 14 years old, 167 cm tall, has blonde hair and grey-blue eyes.
When she was last seen, she was dressed in a sweatshirt, grey trousers and shoes.
Anyone who has any information about the missing persons is asked to contact the police at 12 61-52-911, 12 61-53-616 or 112, 997.
The power of Oławy jumps.
The title of the report from the amateur sports competitions, held on Sunday afternoon 15 September at the hippodrome at Oleandry Street in Oława, may be misleading for some.
Real power is a long way away, but that is the name of one of the types of horse racing...
The competition of jumping power consists in overcoming by rider and horse ever higher obstacles, which in the most prestigious international competitions exceed even two meters.
It is worth adding here that the long-term and still unbeaten world record, established in 1949, by the Chilean Albert Larraguibel, on horse "Huaso", is 247 cm.
Of course, nobody jumped so high in Oława, but the result of the best local amazons at the level of 135 cm is not the worst either...
The competition organized by tireless Jan Sienkiewicz and other activists of JKS "W siodle" was a demonstration part of the slightly earlier held there "Tęczowe zawodów ejazdeckich", about which we write more extensively in this issue of the newspaper, on page 22.
Eight amateur riders trained in the Oławski JKS.
Four competed on ponies and four on large horses.
In the first group Nikola Szołdra performed best, reaching the crazy "Sprinter".
This small, but very dynamic rumak started from overcoming obstacles spread out at a height of 40 cm, and ended only at the station with the top beam 125 cm away from the ground.
However, he was unsuccessful, and after three consecutive rejections, he was removed from the competition by the jury.
The second place in the jumps of ponies was taken by Amelia Pawlak, reaching "Famy", and the third Lena Boruń on "Harmider".
The youngest participant of the tournament - Inga Aksman, galloping and jumping through obstacles on the small mare "Carmen" competed ambitiously.
Even greater emotions accompanied the starting amateurs and spectators during the competition with the participation of large horses.
The threatening-looking falls included Paulina Szewczyk, reaching the "Declaration", and Anastazja Abramenko, who was riding the "Flight".
Fortunately, apart from minor bruises, neither the amazons nor the horses were hurt, so they continued to participate in the competition.
Weronika Łuczkiewicz had a lot of problems with introducing the young mare “Wineta” to the park.
We needed either a trainer's assistant, or another horse for the pair, behind which there was a little crazy "Wineta".
After counting the obstacles from the parking lot, she also skied the full length, so for a few moments in the pits and on the accelerator it was getting dangerous. “Everything is under control!”, Jan Sienkiewicz calmed down a little bit the frightened spectators, especially the youngest ones.
Since the beginning of the competition for large horses, Marta Masalska has performed well in the parking lot, finishing the beautifully presented “Whisky”.
This dignified mare, together with an experienced amateur, after the second approach in the final stage was the first to jump 135 cm and it was the best result of the competition at that moment.
After a while, however, Paulina Szewczyk on "Deklaracja", Weronika Łuczkiewicz on "Wineta" and Anastazja Abramenko on "Lotka" also counted the same height.
To decorate the flo and after receiving the prizes in the form of equestrian equipment, all these competitors went out together, and at the end together with the amateurs on ponies in Radecki's march performed an impressive honorary round, ending these interesting and exciting competitions.

Max Kolonko is cut off from KWW The Patriotic Revolution of Max Kolonko
KWW Patriotyczna Rewolucja Maxa Kolonko is the name of the electoral committee under which the political formation #R Revolution of Mariusz Maxa Kolonko was to go to the October parliamentary elections.
The revolution directed its proposal especially to young voters with right-wing views.
Prior to the elections, Kolonko announced cooperation with Marek Jakubiak or Paweł Kukisz, but neither of these coalitions occurred, and KWW Patriotyczna Rewolucja Maxa Kolonko himself did not even manage to collect enough signatures to put up lists in any constituency in Poland.
Now Kolonko has announced on Twitter that he has ended cooperation with KWW Patriotic Revolution Max Kolonko.
"I will wait for the above-mentioned KWW to delete my name from the name.
I kindly ask you not to associate my person with the above-mentioned entity”, he added and announced that more information will be provided soon.
For the time being, it is not known whether the journalist will continue his work or whether it will be the end of #R Rewolucja.
On July 4, the American Independence Day, journalist Mariusz Max Kolonko, who was in the USA, announced the formation of a new political formation - #R Revolution.
In recent years, Kolonko has become famous for running the Max TV channel on YouTube, where he comments on events in Poland and around the world.
“We’ve had enough of politicians, enough of your harsh jokes, enough of your amateur governments.
It is time for the nation to take power in the country and to govern for the good of the nation,” Kolonko said at the time.
The party's program included issues related to the judiciary (should be elected in general elections), tax changes (equalization of the tax-free amount for all), war reparations (in the form of military aid for the countries of the eastern flanks of NATO, with particular emphasis on Poland), conducting a referendum on the possession of weapons, limiting the number of deputies or introducing single-member constituencies.
A few days after the announcement of the formation of a new political formation, Mariusz Max Kolonko entered into talks with Marek Jakubiak.
At the end of July, Kolonko posted on his social media profile information suggesting that #R would join forces with the Kukiz'15 movement.
However, none of these coalitions ultimately came to fruition.
UBS: Gold close to equilibrium
“The euro exchange rate will remain around PLN 4.35 in the coming months, which will be accompanied by a weak situation on the global markets,” says Michael Bolliger from UBS Wealth Management.
“The expectations of maintaining a solid economic growth rate and a stable monetary policy speak in favour of stabilising the gold prices at the current ceiling,” the specialist in an interview with Bankier.pl estimates.
In his opinion, despite the clear inflationary pressure, the Monetary Policy Council will not decide on interest rate increases in an environment in which the vast majority of central banks are relaxing policy.
“If the zloty is properly valued – the euro should remain in the range of PLN 4.35 in the coming months – Polish bonds are not very attractive.
Far more profitable than Polish securities are emerging market bonds,” says Michael Bolliger, head of asset allocation for emerging markets at UBS Wealth Management.
According to the expert, the main threat to the Polish economy is the deterioration of the global economic situation.
“The global slowdown may deepen, but it should not lead to a severe recession, or at most to a fall in GDP dynamics slightly below zero,” says Michael Bolliger.
"Investors should not underestimate global stocks, which could be damaged by the lack of prospects for resolving the US-China trade conflict and other geopolitical risk factors, including Donald Trump's impeachment procedure and Brexit.
Among the stock markets, Europe should be the relatively weakest”, according to the latest investor letter from UBS Wealth Management CEO Mark Haefele.
"The actions of the countries of the euro area should behave worse than the Americans, because they are more vulnerable in the conditions of increased uncertainty around global trade and fears of a slowdown", we read in the document.
In the opinion of Michael Bolliger, after the hossa on the bond markets of the safest countries pushed the profitability of German 10-year bonds even to minus 0.74 percent, it is still possible to deepen the decline in profitability.
In the longer term, however, the profitability of long-term securities should no longer fall, but only of short-term securities, thanks to the easing of banks' monetary policy.
The Fed has the largest scope for rate cuts, which should weaken the US currency in the coming years.
The long-term equilibrium for the euro is a ceiling of USD 1.29, which would mean a 19-percent potential strengthening of the common currency against the dollar.
We expect further Fed rate cuts, which will result in a narrowing of monetary policy differences around the world.
“Current and budget deficits may not be sufficient to sustain the dollar’s strength in the long term,” says Michael Bolliger.
The Bundeswehr loses its weapons.
Confidential report of the German MON
Since the beginning of 2014, the Bundeswehr has recorded the disappearance of 39 weapons, 39 parts of weapons and 19,445 pieces of ammunition, according to a confidential list compiled by the Defence Department of the Federal Republic of Germany.
The information was provided by the press belonging to the media group RedaktionsNetzwerk Deutschland (RND).
According to a document from the office of the parliamentary secretary of state in the MON Peter Tauber (CDU), so far two pieces of weapons, one part of weapons and 3474 pieces of ammunition have been re-targeted.
Among the military equipment that is still missing are, among others: six MG3 universal machine guns, 11 G3 automatic rifles, four G36 automatic rifles, six signal pistols and two P8 pistols.
In addition, 30 MG3 machine gun barrels are missing.
Left Party deputy leader Martin Renner expressed concern about the situation.
As she told RND journalists, the number of missing weapons and ammunition is "surprising".
All the more so as, as a result of investigations, only a small part of the lost equipment was found.
Martina Renner summed up the effects of these actions as a "poor balance sheet".
In December 2017, the federal prosecutor's office in Karlsruhe charged him with preparing a serious act of violence threatening state security and violating the law regulating access to firearms.
He was accused of preparing attacks on leading German politicians for far-right and racist motives.
His "black list" of targets, which fell into the hands of the prosecutor's office, included the then Minister of Justice Heiko Maas of the SPD, Claudia Roth of the Green Party and Anetta Kahane, a human rights defender and founder of the Amadeu Antonio Stiftung in Berlin.
Franco A. illegally possessed four firearms, over 1,000 rounds of ammunition, and over 50 explosive charges.
Crying children in an airplane.
How to avoid them?
There is a Solution
Japan Airlines has recently introduced a feature designed for people who find travelling with a crying child a nightmare.
Through the website, the lines enable you to check the allocation of seats on the aircraft.
If a child under the age of two travels on a given connection, the “child icon” appears on a specific seat reserved by the parents or guardians.
Thus, the person using the carrier's services has the possibility to choose a place away from that occupied by the toddler.
The BBC stated that the lines had already informed of the deficiencies of this solution.
The “Children’s icon” will not appear if the ticket was booked by a third party or if the flight was changed at the last minute.
As expected, the idea was shared by Internet users.
Some Twitter users suggest that the problem of traveling with crying children can be solved with noise-reducing headphones.
They are children, we used to be children too.
“We need to learn tolerance, because soon we will need maps of sitting places for mouth-breathing, drooling or drunken people,” wrote user G Sundar.
Another student noticed that he was once disturbed by crying children on an airplane, but changed his mind when he became a parent.
There are also lacking supporters of the solution introduced by Japan Airlines.
“Thank you for warning me about screaming children during the 13-hour journey,” Rahat Ahmed wrote.
Majorca counts losses after the bankruptcy of travel agency Thomas Cook
More than 25,000 foreign tourists will not come on holiday to Majorca in October as a result of the bankruptcy announced on Monday by the travel agency Thomas Cook.
As the representative of the autonomous government of the Balearic Islands Marc Pons informed on Friday, among the 25,000 holidaymakers who will not be able to take advantage of the October holiday in Majorca, there are also people who were to travel with companies indirectly associated with Thomas Cook, such as Neckermann.
Pons explained that 80% of the expected holidaymakers, who due to the bankruptcy of the British company had to give up their holiday in Majorca next month, are citizens of Germany and Scandinavian countries.
However, according to Pons, since Thomas Cook did not direct tourists to the Balearic Islands between November and April, the losses to the local economy will be smaller.
He revealed that the government of the Balearic Islands had already started negotiations with international operators on "entering the market of Majorca" after the bankruptcy of the British operator.
According to the estimates of the newspaper "Diario de Mallorca", more than 1000 people will lose their jobs in October due to the tourist crisis in Majorca.
Approximately 800 of them are employees of Thomas Cook's office in Palm.
Others will lose their jobs mainly in the hotel sector.
On Monday, with the announcement of the bankruptcy of Thomas Cook, in many hotels in Majorca, the owners of the facilities demanded from guests to pay an additional fee for accommodation.
This situation was experienced, among others, by several dozen tourists from Poland.
The government of the Balearic Islands estimates that by Thursday dozens of hotels in Majorca had ceased operations at least by the end of October due to the bankruptcy of Thomas Cook and his associates.
On Friday's edition of Diario de Ibiza, the majority of the hotels operating in Ibiza that have worked with the Thomas Cook group do not intend to close down in the coming weeks.
The newspaper reminds that on this Balearic island the British bankrupt cooperated with 42 hotels.
On Wednesday, the autonomous authorities of the Balearic Islands announced that they would ask the Spanish government to support the region with 100 million euros to cover the losses caused by the bankruptcy of the travel agency Thomas Cook.
They revealed that the most injured tourists on this archipelago, about 36,000 people, are located in Majorca.
According to data from the Balearic Government, Thomas Cook is liable to local tourism companies, mainly hotel operators, for the implementation of contracts for the period July-September 2019 for around €5 million.
FIFA Women's Rankings.
Poland still in 29th place, USA in the lead
The Polish women's national football team is ranked 29th in the ranking of the International Football Federation (FIFA) published on Friday.
In the same position, the team of coach Miłosz Stępiński was classified in the previous, July ranking.
Weak team matches.
How will it be in October?
The remaining Americans, who have recently defended the title of world champions, are the leaders.
The second place in the ranking was held by the Germans, while the third place was held by the Dutch.
The Poles are preparing to qualify for the European Championships.
They were due to start their away match against the Czech Republic on 3 September.
The day before the meeting, it was postponed by a year due to the food poisoning of the opponents.
In this situation, the Poles will inaugurate the qualifications with a meeting with the Spaniards on November 12 in Lublin.
Earlier, "Biało-Czerwone" will play two friendly matches – on October 3, leaving Cyprus, and five days later in Kielce with Brazil.
In the group of rivals of the Poles are the representatives of Spain, the Czech Republic, Azerbaijan and Moldova.
The group winners and the top three teams from the second place advance directly to the final tournament.
The remaining six teams from the second position will play in the knockout stages for the last three passes to the European Championships.
The 16 participants will be complemented by the host – England.
Poland's men's national football team dropped from 20th to 22nd place in the FIFA World Rankings in September.
“Rz”: Smog has overthrown the government
“The effects of the ‘Clean Air’ programme are negligible, and coal-fired ovens will dig this winter as if nothing had ever happened,” we read on the front page of today’s Rzeczpospolita.
"So far, 82 thousand applications for financing worth a total of PLN 2 billion have been submitted under the Clean Air Programme, of which 48 thousand decisions have been positive.
The approved proposals amount to a total of more than PLN 915 million," says 'Rz', citing data from the spokesman for the Minister of the Environment.
As the newspaper points out, only part of the costs incurred are reimbursed from the program.
The results of the announced noisy program the daily assesses as "small".
Local governments, quoted by "Rz", see the defeats of "Czyste Powietrza" among others in too much bureaucracy.
"The program should be much simpler: electronic submission, sending invoices by post, possible random control of implementation.
This would improve operations”, believes the mayor of Lidzbarka Warmiński Jacek Wiśniowski.
Activists from the Polish Smoke Alarm noted that in the first year of operations less than 1% of the established target of replacing 3 million boilers was achieved.
As "Rz" notes, although the budget of the programme is PLN 103 billion for 10 years, i.e. PLN 10 billion per year, this amount is virtual.
"In the budget of the National Fund for Environment Protection and Water Management for this year, 1.4 billion PLN were immediately reserved", we read.
Congress agrees on F-35 for Poland
Błaszczak: Now price negotiations
The U.S. Congress approved the sale of 32 state-of-the-art F-35 aircraft to Poland.
“This is one of the last steps before concluding the contract, but not the end of our work,” Mariusz Błaszczak wrote on Twitter.
“We will negotiate hard to achieve the best possible price,” added the Polish minister.
Polish F-35 contract
The Polish Air Force will eventually supply 32 F-35 Lightning II fighters manufactured by Lockheed Martin.
In mid-September, the U.S. Department of State agreed to sell them to Poland.
The Communication underlines that the investment will support US national security and foreign policy by improving the security of NATO, which is an important force for political stability in Europe.
According to information from the State Department, Poland is to pay $6.5 billion for the fighters.
However, this is not the final price.
The State Department noted that the contract will also include the supply of spare parts and repairs, training equipment, engineering, logistics and personnel services, as well as related logistics and program support elements and personnel training.
Lockheed Martin F-35 fighters
The Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II is a single-seat, single-engine, multi-role fighter aircraft of the fifth generation.
The aircraft is capable of carrying out close support missions, bombing and typically fighter air combat missions.
Using stealth technology, the fighter is undetectable to near-range radars.
Recently, Belgium bought the F-35 fighter as part of a contract worth $4.55 billion.
The Belgian Air Force replaced them with F-16s.
Other U.S. allies, including Finland, Switzerland, and the United Arab Emirates, are also expected to consider purchasing U.S. combat aircraft.
Barbie against stereotypes.
Gender dolls
Barbie has launched a series of gender-neutral dolls.
In this way he wants to fight stereotypes.
Barbie manufacturer launched a series of gender-neutral dolls
In addition to Barbie with different skin color, figure or hairstyle, Mattel has introduced sex-neutral dolls for sale.
Toys from the "Creatable World" series wear wigs.
Children can therefore decide whether their Barbie should have short hair or long.
Their wardrobe consists of both trousers and dresses.
In the blink of an eye dolls can from girls become boys and vice versa.
They are also available in different skin colours and with different clothes.
It was also decided not to emphasize the characteristic gender features – gender dolls no longer have full mouths, long eyelashes and a slim waist or – in the case of Ken – wide arms.
The company believes that children do not like their dolls to have gender norms imposed on them, and some parents and feminists are convinced that gender-specific toys inhibit girls' ambitions and reinforce traditional stereotypes.
“The new dolls will allow all children to feel free,” says Mattel.
The Barbie doll, which appeared on the market in 1959 in a swimsuit and high heels, has been criticized in the past for promoting "unhealthy female stereotypes", such as unnatural body proportions.
The company responded to criticism and has already introduced dolls with different skin colours and more rounded shapes.
There were also dolls in Hijab.
Zandberg: a circle or club A circle or club can have several deputies
When Zandberg was asked on ZET radio how many candidates of his party could get to the Sejm from lists of left-wing groups (KW SLD from which list the candidates to the Sejm SLD, Spring and Left Together, starting with the common logo "Left"), he replied that it depends on the result of the committee.
“I believe that the result of the Left will be very good, because we feel that people have hope that the Left is not only right, but also strong,” he said.
According to Zandberg, the Left may have 60–80 members.
“This may mean that the circle or club will have several deputies together.
But it depends on Poles and Poles.
I will not guess and say how it will happen”, he said.
Asked if the Left Together would have a separate circle, Zandberg replied, "We are agreed that we are diverse, and we will not pretend that this diversity does not exist.
I think that this diversity was rewarded by the Poles, because we showed that while we were different, we were able to agree on a common program”.
Asked if the biggest beneficiary of the joint start is SLD leader Włodzimierz Czarzasty, Zandberg replied that in his opinion the biggest beneficiaries are centre-left and left-wing voters.
He said that the SLD would receive the entire subsidy, but denied that "the aim of a political party is to represent its voters".
Zandberg admitted that he would vote for himself in the parliamentary elections.
In the case of elections to the Senate, he pointed out that he wondered.
“The offer is diverse and there are candidates to whom my heart is closer, but there are also those to whom my heart is further away,” he said.
"However, I will say very honestly and clearly that if I found myself in the 44th district of the Senate, I would take an election certificate and vote in another district," the politician emphasized.
“I would hardly try to vote for Minister Kazimierz Ujazdowski (the KO candidate – PAP)”, he added.
In this district outside Ujazdowski, the leader of the Citizens of the Republic of Poland Paweł Kasprzak and Marek Rudnicki from the PiS start.
Dakar: Opening of the largest mosque in West Africa
Tens of thousands of people from all over Senegal gathered on Friday in the capital for the inauguration of a huge mosque, considered the largest in West Africa.
The Muslims arrived in buses, cars and on foot to the Bopp district, where a new mosque with a capacity of 30,000 believers was built.
The mosque was built by the Mouride brotherhood, which belongs to the Sufi sect that dominates Senegal.
The work on the mosque began ten years ago in a wet area of six hectares donated by the government.
The mosque is named after a poem by Sheikh Ahmadou Bamba Mbacke, a 19th-century founder of the Brotherhood, who is venerated as a saint by his followers.
The mosque is covered with Carrara marble and has five minarets.
The highest of them is 78 meters.
The mosque in the middle will accommodate 15 thousand believers, and the other so much can stay on the outside esplanade.
In the richly finished interiors you can admire the gilded dome, giant chandeliers and decorations handmade by Moroccan workers.
The builders claim that the mosque is the largest in West Africa, but the building is still not comparable to mosques in other regions.
In Morocco, Hassan II Mosque in Casablanca has a capacity of 105,000.
The construction of the mosque, which cost more than 30 million euros, was financed by private donations.
In addition to the land, the government funded lighting, sanitation and road works worth 10.5 million euros.
Coach Smyła: Our problem is not Silesia, only ourselves
In eight league matches without a victory, Korona players will try to break in Friday's meeting with the champions of the Ekstraklasa Śląskie.
“Our problem is not wroclaw, only ourselves, we have to work on what we play,” stressed Kielce coach Mirosław Smyła.
The club's last and so far only win in the league was in the first row, when they defeated Benin's Raków Częstochowa 1–0 at home.
Later, Kielce recorded two draws and six defeats, and on Tuesday they lost 0:1 to Zagłębie Lubin in the 1/32 final of the Polish Cup.
“I am optimistic that in the last seconds of the cup match the players fought for the goal, they wanted to draw.
Their fall on the wall after the last whistle was not the result of the collapse, it was only the fall of anger, because they were so close”, said Smyła.
As he pointed out, Silesia has very strong wings, so he will be sensitive to the team playing in the side sectors of the field.
“We are aware of the quality of the opponent, but we also look at what we want to play,” added the coach.
In Friday's match in Korona, Ognjen Gnjatic will certainly not play a pause for the excess of yellow cards, in the squad will also be missing injured Jakub Żubrowski and Michael Gardawskiego.
There are a number of players who are interested in playing in the tournament.
“We have a headache, recently it seemed that it would not be, and now it is,” said Smyła.
Korona defender Daniel Dziwniel emphasized that Silesia will not be an easy rival to break the pass of eight league matches in a row without a victory, while in the extra division everyone can win with everyone.
“We are a good team.
In recent weeks we may not show it on the pitch, but the moment will come when we will win and we believe that it will be on Friday”, said the footballer.
After nine consecutive seasons in the top division, Korona finished fifteenth with five points.
Silesian collected 12 more and ranks in second place.
Friday's match in Kielce will start at 20.30.
These trees can completely disappear from Europe
“42% of the species of trees that make up Europe’s forests are threatened,” warns the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) in Friday’s Red Book of European Trees.
At the head of the list are, among others, chestnuts and hawksbills.
The IUCN, based in Gland, Switzerland, is publishing a list of endangered species of European trees for the first time.
It was compiled by specialists who, based on research, concluded that of the 454 species of trees found in Europe (as well as in other parts of the world), 42% are "highly endangered".
Among the causes, the Red Book mentions the rapid growth of urban agglomerations and global climate change.
However, the most threatened are those trees and shrubs that occur only or mainly on our continent.
As far as the typical European tree stand is concerned, according to IUCN experts, 58% of species are at risk and 15%, i.e. 66 species of trees and shrubs, are threatened with extinction.
Among the main causes of deforestation, the Red Book lists errors in the exploitation of forest stands, accelerated urbanisation, excessive cutting of trees, followed by forest fires and changes in the European ecosystem.
According to the authors of the report, the existence of many European varieties of shrubs, mosses and stands is also seriously threatened.
“The consequences of human activities are leading to the gradual extinction of European plant species and are threatening to extinguish important and undervalued varieties in Europe, which form the basis of European ecosystems and affect the health of our planet,” concluded Luc Bas, Director of the European Office of the IUCN.
Grzegorz Schetyna: I do not promise 600+
"Today the PiS wants to buy the Poles, offering them for freedom distribution on credit, which will have to be paid by future generations", says Grzegorz Schetyna in an interview for "Rzeczpospolita".
In his opinion, "the whole politics of PiS is a pic".
At the same time, the politician promises that "what is given will not be taken away".
Schetyna assures Jackie Nizinkiewicz that he has an idea to overcome the Law and Justice.
It is about mobilising the electorate at the ballot boxes.
In his opinion, the opposition has more potential in this area than Kaczyński's party.
“Today, there are more conscious people who want to live in a normal state than supporters of the PiS, a party that was predestined to proclaimed values such as modesty, humility, transparency,” says Schetyna.
The leader of the Civic Coalition and the chairman of the Civic Platform also outlined the basic principles of the electoral programme of the Coalition.
“First of all, nothing that is given will be received, but we must determine the direction for the future, because the Law and Justice Party deals exclusively with the situation here and now, there is no plan for Poland, which can be seen even after dramatically low investments,” he said.
Secondly, it is about “starting up the energy of Poles, helping and investing in those who work reliably – and those who are entrepreneurs”.
Schetyna explains that the KO program includes a project that will give the least-earning Poles more than 614 zlotys per hand, and more earners – also several hundreds.
The politician also said that he did not want to prosecute for publishing.
As he said, he will do as much as he can, but he does not promise 600+.
"I will never allow the Greek option, where the government negotiated with the opposition for distribution, until finally the country's financial collapse," he stressed.
Schetyna in an interview for Rz also stated that Jarosław Kaczyński and Mateusz Morawiecki are afraid to debate with him and Małgorzata Kidawa-Błońska.
"We would expose their hypocrisy and propaganda," he said.
"The impulse walks before the fall.
Kaczyński is such a statesman as Banas is crystal,” he added.
The leader of the Civic Platform also said that he has not yet decided whether he will apply for the chairmanship of the Platform.
Argentina: Six dead great condors
Six dead giant condors have been found in the Argentine province of Santa Cruz, reports TVN24.
Experts believe that human activity contributed to their deaths.
Large condors have probably been poisoned with a means to kill predators such as cougars, foxes, and wild dogs.
Animals may have ingested toxic sludge.
Apart from one young individual, the rest of the dead condors were adults.
"This is a huge loss to the environment, because the condor must take 10 to 15 years to become fertile and capable of reproduction.
So we are losing a protected species, a endangered species,” says Luis Jacome, director of the BioAndina Foundation, an Argentine environmental organization.
“I think that the use of toxic bait and poison puts not only this species at risk, but all other forms of life, including human health,” he adds.
“Rz”: They want a jewel for the president
Work has begun on awarding the head of state of the precious chain.
The idea was supported by the office of Andrzej Duda – we read in "Rzeczpospolita".
As the newspaper explains, it is a gold chain of the Order of the White Eagle, a royal insignia officially called in the interwar period a jewel of the Republic.
The last time it was used was probably by President Ignacy Mościcki.
"Rz" states that soon such a chain may hit the arms of Andrzej Duda.
On Wednesday, the Senate Committee on Human Rights, the Rule of Law and Petitions voted a motion to start work on the amendment of the Act on Orders and Decorations in order to restore it.
The newspaper writes that this is not the first attempt to restore this chain to the head of state.
The Senate had already proposed such an amendment in 1992, but it fell by one vote.
This time the work is instantaneous.
At the beginning of August, the senators devoted a few minutes to this matter, recognizing that they would seek the opinion of the Chancellery of the President.
It arrived in mid-September.
“I kindly inform you that the Chancellery of the President of the Republic of Poland does not comment on the position presented in this petition,” wrote the President’s Minister Andrzej Dera.
On Wednesday, the Senate committee continued the case and again devoted little time to the matter.
“The President’s office briefly replied to us: it is in favour of restoring it,” said the head of the commission Robert Mamątow from the PiS, quoted by “Rz”.
He submitted a proposal for legislative work, which was supported by the committee.
Police will teach drivers how to drive through the intersection
Police action will be conducted, among others, at the intersection of Ciepliński Avenue and Piłsudski Avenue.
The uniform actions are somehow related to recent complaints by the city authorities about drivers who are not always able to behave properly at the intersection.
On Friday, 27 September, police officers in Rzeszow begin preventive actions “Transit crossings”.
The aim is to eliminate obstacles to traffic: entering the crossing without being able to get off, not obeying traffic lights or road signs.
“We often think that we are alone at the crossroads, and we actually make life difficult for other drivers,” said Marek Ustrobiński, vice president of the city, a few days ago.
His words were heard at a press conference of the town hall, at which the city authorities presented examples of inappropriate movement of cars at intersections, which resulted in traffic jams.
At that time, the president appealed to travellers for common sense on the road and, among other things, faster driving on the lights or not writing SMS while driving.
As it were, the subject was taken over by the rzeszów policemen, who are starting the “Transit Crossings” action from today.
What is it all about?
The aim of the measures is to eliminate the phenomenon of traffic congestion at intersections by drivers entering them without being able to continue driving.
This is a common offence, which contributes to aggravating traffic congestion and creating traffic jams.
It is threatened with a warrant in the amount of 300 PLN and 2 penalty points.
In addition, the uniforms will pay attention to non-compliance with light signals or road signs and improper parking in the area of intersections.
There will also be a lack of fluidity, late starts under signals, free crossings and excessive distances between vehicles.
At what crossroads will action be taken?
Among others, on Lisa-Kula Street from Jagiellońska Street; Cieplińskiego Avenue from Piłsudski Avenue; Targowa Street from Piłsudski Avenue; Śreniawitów Square from Dąbrowskiego Street or Hetmańska Street from Warsaw Insurgents Avenue.
This type of action in the capital of Podkarpackie will be conducted in the next Fridays of October.
They inspected the waste disposal company from “Czajka”
“On Friday, officials of the Department of Environmental Protection of the Old Town of the Wołomiński County and the District Inspectorate of Building Supervision inspected the installation in Zielonka, where waste from the sewage treatment plant “Czajka” in Warsaw is disposed of,” informed Karol Szyszko, spokesman for the Wołomiński Mayor’s Office.
Inspectors from the Voivodeship conducted a check at the plant located in the forests belonging to the municipality of Zielonka.
Private Trading and Transportation Plant “Dar-Trans”, pursuant to an agreement with the capital wastewater treatment plant “Czajka”, performs services of waste-water treatment.
“Inspections of the installation were carried out, and the entrepreneur was asked to provide documentation related to his activities,” Szyszko said.
He added that the post-audit report will be forwarded to the Voivodeship Environmental Protection Inspectorate in Warsaw.
The last inspection in Dar-Trans was carried out by the Voivodeship Inspectorate of Environmental Protection in Warsaw between 29 December 2015 and 11 February 2016.
At that time, it was established that the company did not perform sampling, measurement and testing of groundwater, nor did it have the results of studies of stabilized municipal sewage sludge from the sewage treatment plant "Czajka".
After the inspection of the IOŚ, Dariusz Sobota was called upon to stop violating the conditions of the decision.
Private Trading and Transportation Plant “DAR-TRANS” Dariusz Sobota is one of the companies collecting waste in the form of stabilized municipal sewage sludge from the sewage treatment plant “Czajka”.
According to the decision to dispose of waste on the site, waste of up to 60 000 tonnes per year is processed in the forests near Zielonka.
Warsaw Municipal Waterworks and Sewerage Company informed last Thursday that at the turn of November and December 2018 STUOŚ was decommissioned, which was related to the damage to one of the incineration plant's equipment.
As MPWiK informed, the monthly cost of their export is PLN 1.7 million (calculated on the basis of export costs from 01.01.2019 to 31.08.2019).
Lech Wałęsa supported Małgorzata Kidawa-Błońska.
“You have undertaken a difficult task, you can count on my full support”, said Lech Wałęsa to Małgorzata Kidawy-Błońska on Friday.
“Mr. President, these are very important words for me”, answered the candidate of the Civic Coalition for Prime Minister, the leader of the list of KO in Warsaw.
The former president emphasized that as far as the situation in Poland is concerned, he is now “only a retired fan”.
On Friday, Małgorzata Kidawa-Błońska met with former President Lech Wałęsa in his office at the European Solidarity Centre in Gdańsk.
The son of Wałęsa – Jarosław – also took part in a short conversation behind closed doors.
“You have undertaken a difficult task,” said Lech Wałęsa after the meeting.
“You can count on my full support,” he added.
“The problems facing Poland are known to all of us.
Therefore, it is a great hope that you, as a woman, will cope with these problems, and all of us – those who love Poland – will support your actions to the maximum”, said the former president, addressing Kidawa-Błońska.
Very Important Words
Kidawa-Błońska thanked for her support.
“Mr. President, these are very important words for me, because nobody like you can talk about freedom, about the constitution and knows how important it is”, she said.
“Let us show that we can make a different, wise policy, together, but in accordance with the constitution, in accordance with the law, in accordance with respect for others.
This is how you did your revolution, and this is how we want to change Poland,” stressed Kidawa-Błońska.
Retired fan
In an interview with journalists, Wałęsa said that he is now "only a retired fan".
“Of course I look at it.
I hope that we will reverse the course of events, that what was good, tested, we will return (to that).
The tripartite division of power is the most important, the constitution is the most important, and the courts are essential.
And all of this has to be cleaned up, all of this has to be brought back to normal, and I believe that this time we will do it.
Because if not, then the street criterion awaits us”, said Lech Wałęsa.
“That is why it is so important that Poles go to the elections, think about it and make their own decision.
And this is the most important thing”, admitted Kidawa-Błońska.
“The last chance that we will improve the situation in Poland with a card,” the former president replied.
“We must rebuild the foundations”
Asked about the most important changes that should take place in Poland, Kidawa-Błońska said: "The President said very well.
We need to rebuild the foundation on which we can do all the other things.
If the tripartite division of power does not exist, if the constitution is not respected, we must go back to the beginning and make sure that it becomes obvious and that everyone knows that otherwise Poland will not make a single step forward'.
"Slovakia vs. Poland 3–1 in semi-finals".
Polish volleyball players competed against Slovenians in the semi-finals of the European Championships in Ljubljana.
There was no lack of controversy and discussions with the judges, with the Polish coach Vital Heynen in the lead role.
"White-Red" lost 1:3 and will play for the bronze medal.
Senate decides on key laws
The Senate passed without amendment the Act on the Disclosure of the Estates of the Most Important State Officials and on the Flights of the Most Important Persons in the State.
The amendment to the Act on the Property of the Families of State Officials – without amendments – was voted by 52 senators, 14 were against, three abstained.
At the same time, the senators decided to reject 12 amendments tabled during Wednesday's debate by Senator Sławomir Rybicki.
According to him, the amendments were intended to "civilize" the law and limit the scope of information provided in the declaration on the financial situation of children of their own, spouse's children, children adopted in cases where children remain in the common household with the person obliged to submit the declaration.
The law on the transparency of the assets of the families of the most important state officials, which was drafted in the Prime Minister's office, was passed by the Sejm on 11 September.
The regulations stipulate that, among others, the prime minister, ministers, deputies, MEPs, senators, presidents of the Constitutional Court, the Supreme Administrative Court and the Supreme Court, as well as heads of other state institutions, will be obliged to include in the property declaration information about the personal property of spouses, children and persons in common-law relationships.
The Senate also did not propose amendments to the law on flights of the most important persons in the country.
It regulates which flights have HEAD status and who can be on board government aircraft with the most important persons in the country.
The Act also specifies who is responsible for maintaining the Central Flight Register.
55 senators voted in favour of the bill, 12 against, and four abstained.
According to the law, every flight of the president will be a flight "executed in an official mission".
The President may be accompanied on flights by family members and other persons invited by the President.
However, the flight in the official mission of the Prime Minister and the Marshals of the Sejm and Senate will only be a flight "held for the purpose of carrying out tasks directly related to the function performed".
The Act also specifies the list of persons who may accompany the most important persons in the country during the flight.
Members of the delegation may include invited members of parliament, senators, representatives of public authorities and experts; persons providing technical, medical or organizational support; and journalists.
According to the law, in case of doubts related to the flights of the Marshals of the Sejm and the Senate, the head of the Communist Party of the Republic of Poland will ask for their explanation.
If such doubts are not clarified within the appointed time, the head of the Communist Party of the Republic of Moldova will be obliged to notify the heads of the Sejm or Senate offices of the impossibility of organising such a flight.
The new proxy from sport
Waldemar Paluch appointed his plenipotentiary for physical culture, sport and tourism.

Poles after the first training in Paris, waiting for the last rival
Polish volleyball players held their first training in Paris on Friday, where on Saturday they will compete in a bronze medal match.
Following Vital Heynen's defeat to Slovenia 1–3 in Ljubljana on Thursday, the road to winning the title was closed.
There was a lot of talk about their troubles with the trip to this duel.
This time it was without such problems – on Friday morning they went together with the Slovenians by charter to Paris, and a few hours later they held training in the famous Bercy hall.
According to reports from people present at the classes, the trainer of the world champions was upset.
As Heynen's assistant Michał Mieszko Gogol pointed out, this time the main task was not just the practice of volleyball elements.
“We went to the hall, but for the most part it was time for the band.
The idea was to spend more time together than to train.
Talk, think about how to rebuild it all as a team,” he said.
He confirmed that the semi-final defeat was a painful lesson for both the players and the coaching staff.
“We were brutally brought to the ground.
Without two sentences, we are disappointed.
We still believed that we would come back to this match.
We discussed this match amongst ourselves in the staff, the coach talked a lot with the players.
As two main reasons for failure I would point to inefficiency in the attack and much worse than usual handling of situational balls.
The Slovenes were much better than us in this respect”, he analyzed.
In his opinion, the "White-Red" did not stand in the way of the stress associated with the performance against the co-hosts of the tournament, supported by a loud and large audience.
He admitted that the world champions could sleep a bit smoothly way to the semi-finals.
“Perhaps if we had a similar defeat in the group stage, we would have analysed this lesson more quickly and played differently later in the tournament.
But that's only when you're playing," he said.
Gogol hopes that the anger connected with Thursday's defeat to the Poles will turn into aggression in the bronze match.
“I hope that we will then show our true face.
There is something to fight for.
Recently we won the ME medal in 2011,” he recalled.
Paris is the fifth city and France the third country visited by Poles during these championships.
In the group stage they competed in Rotterdam and Amsterdam, for the first two meetings of the group stage went to Apeldoorn, and for the semi-final moved to Ljubljana.
Nick Kyrgios: severe punishment, but in suspension
The Australian tennis player was banned for 16 weeks and fined $25,000 – in a six-month suspension – for insulting words, gestures and deeds during the last ATP tournaments.
The ATP World Tour is losing patience with Kyrgyzstan, but they still give him a chance to improve.
Summarizing the misdeeds of the most unscrupulous professional tennis player of recent years looks threatening – 16 weeks of break plus a hefty fine, but both penalties are suspended for half a year – a probationary period in which a tenacious athlete will be able to improve.
Nick Kyrgios is only 24 years old, but he has been working for a long time and has achieved a kind of tennis world record – he had to pay the highest single financial penalty in the history of the discipline for breaking the rules of conduct on the court and next to him.
Loud curses, strange gestures, unsportsmanlike behavior, insulting the judge and spectators, breaking two rockets during a lost match with Karen Chachanov – all after the August ATP Masters 1000 in Cincinnati paid $113 thousand.
He did not play for long at the 2019 US Open, but managed to publicly say that ATP officials were "corrupt", which hurt the organization's authorities so much that they instituted a disciplinary investigation against Kyrgios and after a few weeks issued the aforementioned verdict of suspension and another fine.
However, he was forgiven the words about corruption after hearing the accused and knowing the context of the statement.
In the explanatory statement, however, the tennis activists stated that the investigation showed that Kyrgyz's behaviour throughout the past 12 months in many cases raised serious objections and constituted an almost continuous violation of the rules, that he constantly insulted people associated with tournaments and spectators, hence the high penalty.
However, the ATP gave him five days to appeal and immediately postponed execution of the sentence, ordering him to comply within the next six months with several conditions: in the ATP Tour and ATP Challenge Tour tournaments Kyrgios can no longer in any way violate the rules of the code of conduct applicable to professional tennis players, in particular can no longer curse, destroy missiles, argue with judges and the public, or otherwise behave indecently and vulgarly.
He was also advised to seek "continuous support" from mental health coaches during tournaments and also to consult outside of the season with people specialized in dealing with problems of athletes not coping with proper behavior.
Nick Kyrgyz's first comment on the verdict was, "Hey, everybody, I can still play.
I just have to control my behavior, that’s all.”
In practice, the Australian will still have at least a two-week break, because in the Laver Cup he had a sharpened shoulder injury, so he had to resign from the upcoming starts in Beijing (30 September – 6 October) and Shanghai (6–13 October).
In the ATP rankings Kyrgios is ranked 27th.
This year he won two tournaments – in Washington and Acapulco, earned over $1.3 million, so even after the fines he will have a lot left.
GUS: Life in Poland is getting better
According to the report on household budgets published on Friday by the Central Statistical Office, as many as 44% of households rated their material situation as good or rather good.
A year earlier, this percentage was 37.2%, in 2016 it was 33.5%, and previously – since 2009, when the statistical office first examined subjective assessments of the situation of households – it never exceeded 30%.
A total of 8.1% of households considered their material situation to be bad or rather bad, compared to 11.2% a year earlier and more than 20% in 2009.
The best is the material situation of households of self-employed persons.
In this group, it is considered good or rather good by more than 70% of respondents.
On the other extreme are the pensioners' households, where the percentage of such responses was only 18%.
The number of children also has a big influence on the subjective assessment of the material situation of households.
The worst situation is experienced by parents who raise their children alone, of whom 32% declare a good or rather good material situation.
Among couples with children, this percentage varies (depending on the number of children) from 55 to 60 per cent, and among households without children it is 48.8 per cent.
The effect of the 500+ programme is clearly visible in these statistics.
Before it was launched (in 2016), the worst assessment of their material situation was made by parents raising their children alone and families with many children (with at least three children).
Improving subjective assessments of the material situation of Poles is a reflection of the rapid growth in income, especially from work.
However, this is not all, because the percentage of households that consider their situation to be good is increasing faster than real income.
Furthermore, at the level of voivodships there is no clear correlation between the level of income and the assessment of the material conditions of households.
The best assessments are made by the inhabitants of the Opole Voivodeship, where 48.9% of respondents consider their situation to be good or rather good.
Further there are Lubuskie Voivodeships (47.7%), Silesian Voivodeships (47.6%), Mazowieckie Voivodeships (47.3%) and Zachodniopomorskie Voivodeships (47.1%).
Meanwhile, in Opolskie the disposable income (i.e. after paying taxes and contributions) amounted to less than 94% of the national average, and in Lubusz 98%.
The highest incomes were inhabitants of Mazowieckie (120% of the national average) and Silesia (104%).
On average in Poland, the disposable income per person amounted to PLN 1693 in 2018.
In real terms (after adjustment for the impact of price changes) it increased by 4.3% compared to 2017.
Compared to previous years, this result is quite low.
In 2016, per capita income increased by 7%, and a year later by 6.3%.
While income growth slows down, it also hampers spending growth.
These amounted to PLN 1187 per person, which means that in real terms they decreased by 0.7%.
This is the first such case since 2013.
In 2017, expenditure per person increased in real terms by 1.9%, and in 2016 by 4.3%.
Surveys of household budgets suggest that statistical households currently spend 70.1% of their disposable income, whereas in 2014 this share exceeded 80% and by 2006 it exceeded 90%.

USA: Three suicides among airliner crew
Three sailors committed suicide on board the USS George H. W. Bush last week, the US Navy said.
In the last two years, a total of five members of the ship's crew have been killed.
The previous suicide took place in July of this year, and earlier in November 2017.
According to CNN, all three sailors shot themselves last week.
Each incident occurred on land while USS George H. W. Bush was moored off the coast of Virginia.
So far, the involvement of third parties in the case has been ruled out.
Moreover, deaths are not to be associated with each other.
“We need everyone to get involved in making suggestions and ideas on how we can prevent another suicide.
I want to emphasize that there is no stigmatization or other repercussions related to the search for help”, wrote Captain Sean Bailey, the ship's commander, on Facebook.
He is critical of the Pope.
John Paul II did nothing
In an interview with Piotr Lekszycki Stefan Niesiołowski emphasized that in 1981 John Paul II was a huge authority for opposition activists.
“In fact, every one of his words was accepted.”
Some of his actions were later criticized.
“For me, the fact that John Paul II was unable to eliminate Rydzyk’s harmful activities is a great shadow on his pontificate.
After all, this redemptorist – a damager of the Church and Poland – developed his media in the best way possible during the life of the Polish pope,” he explained.
The former politician of the Polish People's Party admitted: "There were murmurs of dissatisfaction, the Pope said something, once Rydzyk did not accept, but he had power and for politics he could simply throw him out of the Church or send him on a mission to New Caledonia or Fiji to collect money for the poor there.
However, John Paul II did not do this, as did his successors”, explained Niesiołowski.
“Apart from that, there was the fatal case of paedophilia and the actions of the Church, or rather their absence.
I thought ahead a little, but I wanted to pay attention to the whole of his life.
We have known about the scale of pedophilia in the Church relatively recently.
The question arises as to how it is possible that John Paul II, being the head of the Church, did not know about these abominable things”, says Niesiołowski in an interview with the journalist.
In the opinion of the former politician of the Civic Platform, the Polish Church is an ally of the PiS.
“We must admit that during the Solidarity period the Church was our most important ally.
All the celebrations began with the Holy Mass, with crosses hanging everywhere.
Now these crosses are written, they have become a symbol of dictatorship – a sign of the written regime.
I repeat: one of the biggest unpleasant surprises is that people like Rydzyk are shaking the Polish Church, that John Paul II did nothing in this matter and that today the Church is an ally of the PiS.
This is the black chapter of the Polish Church, for which the elephant will have to pay,” Niesiołowski argued.
“I hope that Pope Francis will pursue Jędraszewski, Rydzyk and a few others of this type,” he concluded.

PZPN throws punishments at the bulls in the stadiums.
Disqualified griffin
The match in the Polish Cup between Gryf Wejherowo and Lechia Gdańsk for a small hair did not end tragically, when fired by fans from Wejherowo the raccoon by millimeters passed the goalkeeper of the opposing team, Zlatan Alomerovich.
After this incident, the match was suspended for 20 minutes.
The PZPN committee investigating this case imposed a severe punishment on Gryf, excluding him from future matches.
The club will not be able to compete in the Polish Cup in the 2020/2021 season.
In addition, fans will not be allowed to enter their own stadium in the next match.
They will also not be able to travel in groups to league matches until 31 December.
The crowds at the Widzewa Łódź stadium also attracted fans of Śląsk Wrocław.
In this case, however, the PZPN's verdict was milder, because Silesia warned that similar events might occur and sensitized the relevant authorities in this matter.
Despite this, the services allowed the sector of Łódź supporters to be thrown overboard, the chairs to be set on fire and the economy sector to be forced.
The match was suspended for eight minutes and the intervening police had to use a water cannon.
PZPN punished Silesia with a one-time stadium ban in the next match in the Polish Cup and banned the organization of trips to matches in this and the next edition of the Polish Cup.
The ban also applied to league matches in the Ekstraklasa, but remained in effect until 31 December.
Names of foreign cities on road signs also in Polish
GDDKiA plans to replace the signage on the entire managed road network by the end of 2020.
GDDKiA Rzeszów
In Podkarpackie, implementation of the amendment to the regulation of the Ministry of Infrastructure on, among other things, writing the names of foreign cities on road signs also in Polish has begun.
For example, "Lviv" will appear next to "L'viv".
In our province, the changes will be introduced on 94 road signs set at the A4 motorway and national roads: DK19, DK94.
As we hear, it is to be easier, clearer and simpler.
The new guidelines result from the amendment of the Regulation of the Minister of Infrastructure on detailed technical conditions for road signs and signals and road safety equipment.
"We should remember that the names of towns in neighbouring countries often have a Polish sound.
Thanks to the amendment to the law that we have prepared, they will finally appear on the signs on our roads.
The introduction of the new marking starts from the sub-Carpathian section of the A4 motorway”, informed the Minister of Infrastructure Andrzej Adamczyk.
In Podkarpackie, the changes will be introduced on 94 road signs set at the A4 motorway and national roads: DK19, DK94.
The total cost of the investment?
200,000.
In the first place, the new signage will be implemented on the A4 motorway, which is planned by 1 November 2019.
What should the implementation of the idea look like?
It will be used without replacing the boards, on the principle of stickers.
They will replace the existing village names with new ones, written in Polish on existing signs.
Both names will be written in one line – first in Polish, then in the original, in parentheses.
This will make it much easier for people who do not know the spelling of the names of foreign cities in the language of the country where they are located.

Someone shot a swan out of a windmill
In a pond in Zameczno in Lower Silesia, residents noticed a swan with problems with its wings.
After hunting and a visit to the veterinarian, it turned out that someone had arranged a goal with the animal – in his body a blowtorch was found.
"The information about the injured bird was received from the villagers of the Wildlife Rehabilitation Centre in Nowa Sól.
It was reported that the animal had broken wings.
We went to the place.
It was immediately apparent that something was very wrong with him.
We acted quickly and precisely so as not to harm him or expose him to additional stress.
The swan was caught and taken to a veterinarian.
After the first X-ray, it was already known that someone had made a shooting shield out of it.
There were bolt fragments in his body,” says Marcin Walasek, President of Malpol, which manages a rehabilitation centre.
Dime in the center
“The wounds have been cleaned, the bird has been given antibiotics, access to water has been ensured, and a safe place in the centre where he will spend the whole winter.
We are trying to strengthen it.
He is unable to fly at the moment.
Leaving him now would mean that he would probably not survive the winter,” Walasek adds.
After being rehabilitated, the staff intends to release the swan to the same pond in the spring.
After receiving information about the cause of the animal's poor health, the authorities of Żukowice intend to inform the prosecutor's office about the case.
The event took place in Zamecze
Gowin: “We must stimulate Polish small trade”
“The effective taxation of hypermarkets does not solve the problem of retail trade, we will have to consider whether the state has any instruments to stimulate Polish trade,” said Jarosław Gowin, Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Science and Higher Education, Leader of the Agreement.
Gowin stated during a conversation in the radio station "Sygnałach dnia" in Jedynka that the trade is dominated by international networks, which impose such low margins on Polish producers that actually Polish companies cannot develop.
Noting that this problem is very difficult to fight, the deputy prime minister reminded that the PiS government tried to deal with it at the very beginning of the term of office, but got a "counter from the EC".
“We have won before the Court of Justice and I hope that if the United Right wins the next elections and forms a government, we will return to this issue,” he said.
At the same time, he pointed out that "effective taxation of hypermarkets does not solve the problem of Polish, i.e. small trade".
“It will be necessary to consider whether the government, the state has any instruments to stimulate Polish trade,” said Gowin.
In May, an EU court ruled that the European Commission had made a mistake in recognising that the Polish retail tax was an unauthorised public aid.
The Retail Sales Tax Act provided for the introduction of two rates of trade tax: 0.8% on income between PLN 17 million and PLN 170 million per month and 1.4% on income above PLN 170 million per month.
The tax was to apply from September 2016.
In September 2016, the European Commission opened an infringement proceeding against Poland.
Brussels then argued that the tax structure could favour smaller shops, which could be considered public aid.
It then stated that the fine had been imposed in an unlawful manner.
It also ordered the suspension of the tax until its analysis was completed by officials in Brussels.
Poland did not agree with this position, but tax collection was suspended.
The EU Court's decision in May opened the way for the reintroduction of the tax, but it did not end the matter.
On 24 July, the Commission appealed to the Court of Justice.
On Thursday, the press service of the EUSC informed PAP that the case is currently at a written stage, in which both the European Commission and the Polish government present their arguments in writing.
For the time being, it is not known whether and when the oral procedure, i.e. the hearing of the parties and a possible hearing, will start.
It takes a good few to a dozen months from the appeal to the announcement of the judgment.
“Such proceedings take an average of one year,” the source told PAP in the Luxembourg Court.
How to dress a child for baptism?
We highlight some practical solutions
Baptism is an extremely important ceremony in the life of a baby and its parents.
It is often the first occasion when the whole family gathers around the child, celebrating his or her arrival in the world.
So it's no wonder that the newly baked mom and dad want their comfort to look as good as possible on this day.
However, before you make a final decision about the baby's outfit, consider whether it will also be comfortable.
In shops you can find many costumed sets that do not provide the toddler with proper comfort.
So what should we pay attention to?
The basic criterion for choosing a baptismal garment is the age of the child
Until recently, several-week-old babies were baptized, arranged in white sets and placed in the same barrels or large compartments.
Today, children who enter the sacrament are often older: several months old, a year old or even older.
It is not difficult to guess that such a great comfort needs a slightly different baptismal garment.
Therefore, if your child is 3 to 4 months old on the day of baptism, he or she will probably spend the ceremony in a pram or in the hands of parents or baptists.
The best solution will be to dress it in comfortable, cotton sleeping bags or sets.
Although this item of wardrobe is considered a daily dress, it is sufficient to look for its sacred variants, for example with a waistband or lace.
Perfect for the boy will be a body with a print of a fly and scarves.
In the case of older children, you can afford to have more fantasy in your clothes.
The girl will look beautiful in a simple tulle dress
Many parents of girls are looking forward to richly decorated, fancy christening dresses complete with coats, belts and caps.
Unfortunately, a large number of manufacturers use artificial, non-breathable materials for their products, in which the child is simply uncomfortable.
In search of suitable clothing, it is better to look at the shop Asanti for Kids, which offers elegant outfits on cotton linings.
Delicate tulle skirts, satin dresses, lace, appliqués and charming sets will make your daughter look beautiful and feel comfortable.
The perfect outfit for a little gentleman: a cotton suit
Until recently, the parents of boys were in fashion for suits that were copies of "adult" models.
Polyester navy uniforms and trousers, stiff collars or muskets often made the young elegants loudly demonstrate their dissatisfaction.
Today, fortunately, they have been replaced by comfortable, cotton sets.
Just look at the sets available in Asanti for Kids, i.e. soft jersey trousers, and a blouse decorated with a vest pattern at the front.
These pages look extremely devout, and at the same time do not interfere with the movements of the toddler learning the world.
Krystyna Pawłowicz published a statement of assets
Krystyna Pawłowicz made a statement of assets at the end of her term.
As a result, the MP of the Polish Socialist Party collected PLN 110 thousand in savings.
Let us recall that Pawłowicz announced her departure from politics.
At the end of his term of office, he has the amount of PLN 110 thousand.
As a result of the statement made by the Member, she receives a monthly pension of PLN 4.7 thousand.
Pawłowicz owns an apartment worth PLN 570,000 and a slightly smaller one, which he rents, charging PLN 880 per month.
She also invests in industrial metals, estimating the investment at PLN 150,000.
Earlier, Jarosław Kaczyński also published a statement of assets.
Voting on the Conservative Party conference recess
British parliamentarians voted against a three-day recess in the House of Commons for the Conservative Party's annual programme conference, as requested by the government.
289 voted in favour, 306 against.
As a rule, the House of Commons does not meet during party conferences, so MEPs do not have to give up their seats or parliamentary meetings.
However, the opposition parties recognised that at such a crucial time as the last few weeks before the UK's planned exit from the European Union on 31 October, Parliament should not interrupt its proceedings.
289 MEPs voted in favour of the government's request for a recess, while 306 voted against.
Two opposition parties after the conventions
Failure to agree to a recess may be seen as political revenge by the opposition on Prime Minister Boris Johnson for his decision to suspend parliament for five weeks (on Tuesday the decision was found by the Supreme Court to be unlawful and unprecedented) and for not wanting to apologize for it after the judges' ruling.
Following this ruling, the House of Commons resumed its session on Wednesday, and the most important event of the day was Johnson's speech and the ensuing heated debate.
Johnson accused the opposition of blocking Brexit and avoiding early elections.
“It is time to implement the Brexit.
It must be implemented in order to respect the result of the referendum.
Brexit must come so that we can deal with an agreement on citizens' priorities, on healthcare, on the cost of living.
Brexit must be realised so that we can unite this country,” Johnson said.
The Conservative Party conference is due to start in Manchester next Sunday and last until Wednesday 2 October.
Conferences of the two main opposition groups – the Labour Party and the Liberal Democrats – have already taken place.
One of Johnson's justifications for suspending parliament for so long was party conferences.
Media: Andrzej Duda blames Israel for anti-Semitic attacks in Poland
“President Andrzej Duda believes that the anti-Semitic attacks in Poland are a reaction to the anti-Polish rhetoric of Israeli leaders,” write foreign media.
The President's spokesman strongly denied these reports.
“It’s just not true,” Błażej Spychalski wrote on Twitter.
Israeli media, including Haaretz and the Jerusalem Post, citing the Jewish Insider, said that Andrzej Duda, during a meeting with representatives of the Jewish diaspora in the Polish consulate in New York, stated that Israel was to blame for the recent anti-Semitic attacks in Poland.
The President said that the increase in anti-Semitic attacks in Poland is a reaction to the anti-Polish rhetoric of Israeli leaders.
He referred to the words of the Israeli Foreign Minister, Israel Katz, who stated in February that "the Poles threw anti-Semitism with mother's milk".
Andrzej Duda said that he regretted that Israel did not apologize for the humiliating statements of its politicians.
He also referred to the act of aggression against the Polish Ambassador to Israel Marek Magierowski.
In May, he was attacked by an attacker who shouted: "Polish, Polish".
“The quotation is not only inaccurate.
It's just not true," Błażej Spychalski wrote on Twitter.
He stressed that Duda "never said that Israel was responsible for the recent anti-Semitic attacks in Poland".
According to Spychalski, the portal "invented it".
According to "JI" interlocutors, during the meeting there was also a dispute between Holocaust survivors, awarded the Commander's Cross of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Poland Edward Mosberg and Rabbi Shmuley Boteach.
Mosberg had agreed with President Duda's words and said that it was Jews from Israel "like Israel Kac" who were responsible for the rise of anti-Semitism.
According to sources, Boteach had to interrupt Mosberg's statement.
Who is Banas and what is his fault?
The tenement leased by the tenants led the journalist to discover negligence in the property statements of Marian Banasia.
We summarize another affair that shook the ruling camp.
TVN’s “Superwizjera” journalists revealed that Marian Banas, the president of the Supreme Chamber of Control, has not entered in the property declaration of a 400-meter tenement house, which is located in Kraków’s Podgórze, in recent years.
Moreover, his landlord had to run a sex business in the mentioned tenement house (and thus rent rooms for hours).
In turn, the building itself has allegedly been the collateral for the repayment of the loan since 2016.
Bertold Kittel's television show "Supervisor" drew attention to the irregularities.
The journalist revealed that Banasia's tenement house was rented by people connected with the criminal world to use as a place for "erotic meetings".
The clients were men using prostitution services.
Banas responded to the accusations in a vague and confused manner.
Interestingly, the tenement rented by the tenants led the journalist to discover negligence in Banasia's property statements.
The house itself was described in them unclearly, and the income from its rent was to be reduced.
“The assets of Marian Banasia and his wife can be worth between 6 and 8 million PLN.
In total, the spouses can boast of two houses, three apartments, savings [...]”, writes Money.pl.
And according to the analysis of the portal, the Banasia tenement house itself was worth about PLN 3 million.
The Central Anti-Corruption Bureau currently controls Marian Banasia's financial statements for the years 2015-2019.
Banas announced that by the time of its completion he would suspend his activity in NIK. “I will apply to the Marshal for free leave”, he assured.
The opposition demands clarification.
“We do not hear that the CBA has extended its investigation or speeded up the examination of Marian Banasi’s financial statements.
Therefore, we are forced to hand over the state authorities and notify the possibility of committing a crime [...]”, said PO-KO member Mariusz Witczak.
“If an ordinary Pole had so blatantly underestimated the rental value of his real estate, he would already have 10 checks, tax deductions and criminal proceedings,” he added.
He went high, he fell low

Cooler Master Launches Graphics Card Holder
Graphics cards can now weigh really a lot, and this naturally makes room for a category of products that would have been in vain to look for on store shelves a decade ago.

The new graphics card holder model is not only a functional solution that allows you to maintain your graphics card more reliably without relying solely on the strength of the PCI-express slot.

"Rzeczpospolita": Ignoring a policeman's orders will be punished
According to the newspaper, disregarding a police officer's order for specific behaviour is to be a new type of offence, threatened with fines, arrest or imprisonment.
The political trade unionists want to introduce such a change.
The idea went to the Sejm Committee on Petitions.
“The case is serious, because already every year more than half a million criminal cases reach Polish courts,” we read.
"Rzeczpospolita" has determined that the petition, which the Independent Trade Union of Policemen writes to MPs on the amendment of the Code of Offences has a chance of success.
The authors of the petition propose a new wording of Article 54a of the Code of Offences.
It would read: "Whoever does not comply with the request or order of a public official issued within the limits and on the basis of the provisions of the Act, shall be subject to arrest, fine or restriction of liberty."
"Paragraph 3 of this provision provides for an identical punishment for those who, by failing to execute orders, prevent or hinder the performance of their duties," the daily reports.
Sociologist Andrzej Kowalski told "Rzeczpospolita" that although he agrees with the main message of the proposal, he fears that if it is implemented, it may be used in matters of political demonstrations.
“In situations of freedom demonstrations it would be unfavourable and instead of alleviating the situation, it would even exacerbate it,” he adds.
According to statistics provided by the newspaper, 86% of citizens positively assessed police interventions in 2018 and that every month the services undertake 1.5 million interventions in the city.
Buras worries about Europe
Jáchym Topol has writing in his blood.
Among his ancestors are editors, translators, writers.
His father, Josef Topol, was one of the most important Czech post-war playwrights, today listed in the same row as Václav Havel.
From the beginning, therefore, there was a curse of talent hanging over Jáchym, which he tries to use.
After eight years, he returned with "The Sensitive Man".
The protagonists are Buras and Soňa together with their two sons, who do not form a typical Czech family.
They are wandering actors, they travel around Europe.
He is a lover of Shakespeare and a thief, she is a one-eyed translator who does not break up with a bottle of wine.
One of the boys from birth did not make a sound, and for the other time stopped in childhood.
But it is not the heroes who are the most important in this story.
All of them are merely a background for observing a world in which there is no longer room for artistic nomads.
It is a world of a flooded province, a society of old, suspicious people and disconnected youth.
“Sensitive Man” sometimes turns into absurd theatre.
The narrative follows the didaskalia, and the conversations of the characters create this world.
The scene is a Europe full of worries about its future, but also of constant questions about the past.
Belgium: Brussels Airlines cancelled 105 flights due to the bankruptcy of Thomas Cook
Although the British travel agency Thomas Cook has collapsed, its Belgian subsidiary Neckermann is functioning.
However, the company has problems.
According to VRT, Brussels Airlines has announced that it will cancel 105 flights in October due to problems related to the bankruptcy of Thomas Cook.
Neckermann also laid off 75 employees.
All office trips that have been booked in Belgium will be cancelled, but holidaymakers will be able to receive a refund.
The court in Ghent also declared the bankruptcy of three Belgian subsidiaries: Thomas Cook Belgium, Thomas Cook Retail and Thomas Cook Financial Services.
Currently, around 12,000 Belgians are abroad on trips purchased from Thomas Cook.
Another 40,000 people were to leave the office by the end of the year.
On Monday, Thomas Cook Belgium spokeswoman Leen Segers said that the company is now "fully operational" despite the announcement of bankruptcy by the British parent company, which caused concern among employees and customers.
At that time, the office was reassuring that customers who bought tours in it would go on holiday.
Thomas Cook – the oldest and one of the largest travel agencies in the world – announced bankruptcy on the night of Sunday to Monday.
The immediate cause of the bankruptcy was the collapse of last chance talks with creditors and potential investors on Sunday.
The creditors demanded that, in addition to the £900 million rescue plan already agreed in August, the company obtain an additional £200 million as collateral for the winter period, when travel agencies usually have lower turnover.
However, the company's problems have grown over the years, resulting in a debt of £1.6 billion.

Görlitz in Germany offers free accommodation per review
Free accommodation in exchange for an opinion – such an extraordinary offer prepared for the new German Görlitz.
The measures are intended to help combat the progressive decline in the number of inhabitants of the city.
Görlitz is the easternmost city in Germany.
The beautiful pastel old town attracts 140 thousand tourists every year.
However, according to The Guardian, the city faces significant challenges.
Görlitz has the lowest wages in Germany.
The city is also experiencing a steady decline in population.
After the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, most of them moved to the west of the country, resulting in a 25% decline in the city's population.
In 2013 it had 54,000 inhabitants.
In order to combat depopulation, officials came up with the idea of offering free monthly accommodation in the city.
So far, 150 applications have been received for the programme.
Two-thirds of them were inhabitants of large cities.
People from Hungary, the Czech Republic, the United States and the United Kingdom also took an interest in the programme.
“When we implemented the programme, we thought that it would convince people to move to Görlitz,” said one of the project participants.
“Now we feel it doesn’t matter whether we stay here after four weeks or not,” he added.
The city has seven thousand vacant dwellings and unemployment is three times higher than the national average.
Although the city authorities hope that some will move permanently, the main aim of the programme is to obtain the opinions of the participants.
The information gathered from interviews and questionnaires is intended to help revitalise smaller German cities.
“We want to know more about what people need and, if they decide to move, what their motivation was,” said Robert Knippschild, programme manager.
Other cities have already experimented with ideas to attract new residents, offering them incentives in the form of accommodation.
The first was Detroit, which introduced a program to pay promising young professionals to live and work in the city for a year.
Today, such solutions are used in many places, from the Greek island of Antikythera to Candela in Italy, or in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
